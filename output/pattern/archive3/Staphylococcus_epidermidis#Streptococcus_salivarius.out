ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.
mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
background/aims: fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. methods: the experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. results: we found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius or actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a ph-dependent manner. the results of experiments with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. however, direct fluoride inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to those of s. salivarius with ph-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and indirect inhibition of urease. conclusion: fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.
purification and properties of a bacteriocin of staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
an extracellular bacteriocin of staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. its molecular mass was 3500 da and pi was 10.5. this bacteriocin inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis, but streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. the mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
