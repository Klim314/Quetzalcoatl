TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == increase of mannose residues, as salmonella typhimurium-adhering factor, on the cecal mucosa of germ-free chickens infected with eimeria tenella.
AB  == to study increase of the salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. inhibition of s typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (d-mannose, d-galactose, l-fucose, alpha-methyl-d-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. only d-mannose had inhibitory effects. whereas, d-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of s typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose inhibited adherence of s typhimurium. d-mannose significantly (p < 0.05) increased adherence of bacteroides sp. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of clostridium perfringens and bifidobacterium thermophilum. under microscopic observation, only concanavalin a and lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. in e tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. these results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the  intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.

TI  == oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (two strains), proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and a bacteroides sp. the phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. the three listeria strains were the most susceptible  to phagocytic uptake and the salmonella strain was relatively resistant. the intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. the strains with the best intracellular survival were ent. faecalis and two of the three listeria strains. the ability of s. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two e. coli strains. oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.

TI  == the role of intestinal microflora on the prevention of salmonella colonization in gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  == the possible role of the intestinal microflora in inhibiting the colonization of  salmonella in the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens was investigated. in the cecal contents of newly hatched (2-day-old) and adult normal (7-mo-old) chickens, a larger number of escherichia coli and a smaller number of lactobacillus sp. were  noticed in 2-day-old chickens than in adult chickens. gnotobiotic chickens treated with cecal contents from either newly hatched or adult birds were orally  exposed to salmonella typhimurium, and on the following day s. typhimurium in the ceca were counted. the adult microflora prevented s. typhimurium colonization more strongly than did the microflora of newly hatched chicks. gnotobiotic chickens treated with e. coli, lactobacillus sp., or the mixture of both organisms were orally inoculated with s. typhimurium. the mixture of both organisms suppressed s. typhimurium colonization most effectively, followed by e. coli alone and lactobacillus sp. alone, escherichia coli may play a role of competitive exclusion only in newly hatched chickens, whereas lactobacillus sp. may have a partial role in adult chickens.

TI  == bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the effects of bacteroides sp., fusobacterium mortiferum, bacteroides fragilis, and sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo  and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of escherichia coli and salmonella minnesota, wild type and r595. intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid a of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of  coagulation. lipopolysaccharide and lipid a of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause  aggregation of human platelets in vitro. washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid a of bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and c6-deficient rabbit plasma. lipid a, but not lipopolysaccharide, of e. coli and washed cells of s. minnesota r595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. these results indicated that bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets  or terminal components of complement.
