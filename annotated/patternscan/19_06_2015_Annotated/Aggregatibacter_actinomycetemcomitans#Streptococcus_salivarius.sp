TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (pds ii(r)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (met) or ciprofloxacin (cip) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. materials and methods: fibrous matrices were processed from pds polymer solution by electrospinning. antibiotic-containing pds solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% met, 25 wt.% met, 5 wt.% cip, and 25 wt.% cip. pure pds was used as a control. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) was done to evaluate met and cip release. dual-species biofilms formed by lactobacillus casei (lc) and streptococcus salivarius (ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. after 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) using agar diffusion assay. results: a three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. pure pds showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% met (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% met (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% cip (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% cip (765 +/- 288 nm). hplc demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. no inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. meanwhile, cip-containing matrices inhibited growth of fn and aa. conclusion: cip-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. clinical relevance: based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) discs.
AB  == purpose: bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. the aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (osseotite(r)) and an osseotite surface with nanometer-scale discrete crystalline deposition (dcd) of calcium phosphate (cap)(nanotite(r)). methods: surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (sem) observation. bacterial adhesion on machined, osseotite(r), and nanotite(r) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: streptococcus mutans ccug 35176, streptococcus sanguis ccug 17826, streptococcus salivarius ccug 11878, actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans ccug 37002, porphyromonas gingivalis ccug 2521. the assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: total viable count (tvc) estimation and confocal laser scanning microscopic (cslm) studies. results: the surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<nanotite(r)<osseotite(r). the attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on osseotite(r) and even higher on nanotite(r) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). the reduction  in bacterial attachment was more significant on osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) for  a. actinomycetecomitans, s. mutans and s. sanguis than for p. gingivalis and s. salivarius strains. conclusions: nanotite(r) samples showed the lowest amount of  bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher osseotite(r) surfaces.

TI  == antibacterial activity of myristica fragrans against oral pathogens.
AB  == myristica fragrans houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in penang island, malaysia. the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus mitis atcc 6249, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and three gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.25 to  640 mg/ml and 0.075 to 40 mg/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing method. among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with mean mic value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml; p = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean mbc value ranging from 0.625 mg/ml to 20 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml. while for seed and mace of myristica  fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. all of the  extracts of myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against  fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586. thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == interference with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: colonization of epithelial cells under hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly  be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. the aim of this study was  to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. methods: cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with streptococcus sanguinis kth-4, streptococcus cristatus cc5a, streptococcus salivarius tove and streptococcus mitis bms before  aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. experiments were performed in a modified robbins-device-type flow cell. bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. results: the streptococci were able to inhibit a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by s. sanguinis. conclusion: these data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial  bacteria in periodontal treatment.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesion inhibited in a flow cell.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. this study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. methods: the colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled a. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal  laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. culture and quantitative polymerase  chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a modified robbins device. results: colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis). the most inhibiting species was s. sanguinis. conclusion: these results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == bacteria interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization.
AB  == it is known that beneficial bacteria can suppress the emergence of pathogenic bacteria, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. this study examined the potential for a similar suppression of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus)  actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells, due to its potential relevance in periodontal diseases. seven presumed beneficial bacteria were examined for their ability to interfere, exclude, or displace a. actinomycetemcomitans from epithelial cells in vitro. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius showed prominent inhibitory effects on either a. actinomycetemcomitans recovery or colonization. these results confirmed the hypothesis that bacterial interactions interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells in vitro, and demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguinis.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  == naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. in general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for  prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. as an  alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. a novel decapeptide, kkvvfkvkfk (ksl), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. cytotoxic activity of ksl against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional nmr in aqueous and dmso solutions. mics of ksl for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). minimal bactericidal concentrations of ksl were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the mics. ksl exhibited an ed(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees c) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in addition, ksl damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. in vitro toxicity studies showed that ksl, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. nmr studies suggest that ksl adopts an alpha-helical structure in dmso solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment,  whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. this study shows that ksl may  be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial activity of etchants used for a total etch technique.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of eight commercially available etchant materials and positive and negative controls as they came into contact with bacteria commonly found within the oral cavity. the following bacteria were used in this study: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and actinobacillis actinomycetocomitants. the study was conducted in  two parts: part i--etchants and controls placed within wells in agar plates; part ii--enamel-dentin disks saturated with the etchants for 20 seconds and placed on  the agar plates with the controls. zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. the results of the study indicate that all of the etchants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested.

TI  == delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.
