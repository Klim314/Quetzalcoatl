TI  - Essential oils and isolated compounds from Lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
AB  - In the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E.Br. (L. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. The periodontal pathogens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans; ATCC 43717), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum; ATCC 25586) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis); ATCC 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), whereas Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis; ATCC 25285) was used as the control microorganism. Osteoclast (OC) apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay and Fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. The analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that P. gingivalis had the lowest MIC values, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. L. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the OCs. This study demonstrates that L. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. In fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.
TI  - Evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia.
AB  - In total 122 non-duplicate Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. Most of the strains belonged to the B. fragilis group (55%), followed by Prevotella strains (34.4%) and Fusobacterium spp (10.6%). The species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. The most common isolates were B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus. Among Prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were P. buccae, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. denticola and P. nigrescens, and most of the Fusobacterium spp. were F. nucleatum. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the E-test methodology. The percentage of the susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (MIC </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. Three B. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). All Prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented Prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 mug/ml). The susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. All Fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.
TI  - Distinct polymicrobial populations in a chronic foot ulcer with implications for  diagnostics and anti-infective therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial infections caused by combinations of different bacteria are being detected with an increasing frequency. The evidence of such complex infections is being revealed through the use of novel molecular and culture-independent methods. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade regarding the diagnostic application of such molecular techniques. In particular, 16S rDNA-based sequencing and even metagenomic analyses have been successfully used to study the microbial diversity in ecosystems and human microbiota. Here, we utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as a diagnostic tool for identifying different bacterial species in complex clinical samples of a patient with a chronic foot ulcer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old female suffered from a chronic 5x5cm large plantar ulcer located in the posterior calcaneal area with subcutaneous tissue infection and osteomyelitis. The chronic ulcer developed over a period of 8 years. Culture and DHPLC revealed a distinct and location-dependent polymicrobial infection of the ulcer. The analysis of a superficial biopsy revealed a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas the tissue-deep biopsy harbored a mixture of four different bacterial species, namely Gemella morbillorum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides fragilis, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case highlights the difficulties in assessing polymicrobial infections where a mixture of fastidious, rapid and slow growing bacteria as well as anaerobes exists as structured communities within the tissue architecture of chronic wound infections. The diagnosis of this multilayered polymicrobial infection led to a microbe-adapted antibiotic therapy, targeting the polymicrobial nature of this infection in addition to a standard local wound treatment. However, a complete wound closure could not be achieved due to the long-lasting extensive destruction of tissue.
TI  - In vitro activity of Biapenem plus RPX7009, a carbapenem combined with a serine beta-lactamase inhibitor, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Biapenem is a carbapenem being developed in combination with RPX7009, a new inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases. Biapenem was tested alone and in combination with fixed concentrations of RPX7009 by agar dilution against 377 recent isolates of anaerobes. A separate panel of 27 isolates of Bacteroides spp. with decreased susceptibility or resistance to imipenem was also tested. Comparator drugs included meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tigecycline plus imipenem, doripenem, and ertapenem for the 27 selected strains. For recent consecutive strains of Bacteroides species, the MIC(90) for biapenem-RPX7009 was 1 mug/ml, with a MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml for meropenem. Other Bacteroides fragilis group species showed a MIC90 of 0.5 mug/ml for both agents. The MIC(90)s for biapenem-RPX7009 were 0.25 mug/ml for Prevotella spp., 0.125 mug/ml for Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum, 2 mug/ml for Fusobacterium mortiferum, 0.5 mug/ml for Fusobacterium varium, </= 0.5 mug/ml for Gram-positive cocci and rods, and 0.03 to 8 mug/ml for clostridia. Against 5 B. fragilis strains harboring a known metallo-beta-lactamase, biapenem-RPX7009 MICs were comparable to those of other carbapenems (>/= 32 mug/ml). Against Bacteroides strains with an imipenem MIC of 2 mug/ml, biapenem-RPX7009 had MICs of 0.5 to 2 mug/ml, with MICs of 0.5 to 32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. For strains with an imipenem MIC of 4 mug/ml, the MICs for biapenem-RPX7009 were 4 to 16 mug/ml, with MICs of 8 to >32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. The inhibitor RPX7009 had no antimicrobial activity when tested alone, and it showed little or no potentiation of biapenem versus anaerobes. Biapenem-RPX7009 showed activity comparable to that of imipenem and was superior to meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem against imipenem-nonsusceptible Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Anaerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli
AB  - At present there are over two dozen genera of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. In most clinical infections, only the genera Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium need be considered. These genera are prevalent in the body as members of the normal flora (Fig.20-1), constituting one-third of the total anaerobic isolates from clinical specimens, and may become involved in infections throughout the body (Fig.20-2). Within the Bacteroides group, B fragilis is the most common pathogen, followed by B thetaiotaomicron and other members of the B fragilis group. Among the bile-sensitive Prevotella species, the ones most commonly encountered clinically are P melaninogenica, P oris, and P buccae. Porphyromonas species seem to be much less pathogenic except in dental infections. Fusobacterium nucleatum is the Fusobacterium species most often found as a pathogen, but F necrophorum occasionally produces serious disease. These genera contain numerous other species that rarely or never infect humans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - [Identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  - Routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. This study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. One hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during March 20-October 30 2007, were included in the study. The specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to Wilkins Chalgren agar, Schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. Isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with API 20A panels (Bio-Merieux, France) via conventional methods and by the help of AN-IDENT Discs (Oxoid, England). Penicillin G, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with E- test method. Twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 Escherichia coli and 4 Enterococcus spp.) growth. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. The distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), Bacteroides spp. other than B.fragilis (n = 4), Clostridium spp. (n = 2), Fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), Prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), Peptococcus niger (n = 2), Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and Lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). Beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 B. fragilis isolates. All of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. The highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin G (9/22; 41%). While anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. Among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. The results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at Konya area in Turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.
TI  - Coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  - Coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. The aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. Stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. While 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less common (4% incidence). Coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from Bacteroides fragilis with Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis with C. perfringens. Oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from B. adolescentis with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii with C. perfringens and F. nucleatum with Lactobacillus paracasei. Heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.
TI  - [Application of "Microring AN" to "Level 1": presumptive identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - Commonly isolated anaerobic gram-negative rods (4 genus 64 strains), some other important gram-negative anaerobic species (9 genus 45 strains), and cigar-shaped clostridia (11 strains) were studied on their susceptibility patterns to 6 agents on "Microring AN". Some modifications were made in the methods and interpretation of results. Susceptibility patterns to erythromycin, rifampicin, colistin, benzylpenicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin were following (sensitive [S], intermediate [I], resistant [R], variable [V]): for Bacteroides fragilis group, V, S, R, R, R, R, respectively; for non-pigmented Prevotella, V, S, V, V, R, R, respectively; for pigmented Prevotella, S, S, SR, V, V, R, respectively: for Fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, R(S), S(I), S(IR), S(R), S, R, respectively; and for F. varium, R, R, S/I, R(S), S, R, respectively. Some results were different from that in the data table in the instruction of "Microring AN", because of differences of methodology and changes of susceptibility of those species during years. As to the other groups, that are not included in the data table in the instruction, results were following: for Bilophila wadsworthia, R, R, S, R, S, R, respectively; Desulfovibrio, V, R(S), R, R, S, R, respectively; for cigar-shaped clostridia, V, S(R), R, R, S(R), S, respectively. "Microring AN" was useful for presumptive identification in genus, species, or group level, though morphological observation and some additional simple tests such as bile-sensitivity and catalase were essential.
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - Antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most Gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some Clostridium difficile and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole MIC values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/mL. Ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive Gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though MIC values for piperacillin were often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. Carbapenems had MIC values < or =4 microg/L against all except some C. difficile and 2 strains of B. fragilis. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except C. difficile and a single Bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin MICs were found mainly among the B. fragilis and Prevotella groups, and a few C. difficile and F. nucleatum strains.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - Anaerobic microbiology in 198 cases of pleural empyema: a Bulgarian study.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in 198 patients with pleural empyema and the susceptibility of isolates to eight antibacterial agents. Isolates were identified by the Crystal anaerobes identification system, API System rapid ID 32 A and/or routine methods. Susceptibility was tested by Sceptor MIC system for anaerobic bacteria and limited agar dilution method. Anaerobic bacteria were found in 74.2% of the patients and included 247 strains within 21 genera. The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (52 isolates), Fusobacterium (51), microaerophilic streptococci (24), Prevotella (19) and Bacteroides species (11). Common species/groups were Fusobacterium nucleatum (in 27.2% of specimens yielding anaerobes), Micromonas micros (8.2%), Finegoldia magna (7.5%), Bacteroides fragilis group (6.8%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6.1%) and F. necrophorum (5.4%). No resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin/sulbactam was detected. The susceptibility rates of Gram-negative anaerobic isolates to penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were 63.8%, 90.2%, 87.8%, 58.6%, 98.8% and 71%, and those of Gram-positive anaerobes were 79.2%, 100%, 84.3%, 68.4%, 41.9% and 75%, respectively. The wide diversity of isolated anaerobic genera and species and the susceptibility patterns of the isolates emphasize the role of the anaerobic microbiology in cases of pleural empyema.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 Hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. The inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and Hp strains, and were method dependent. The cagA status of Hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. The success and progress of Hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating Hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of Hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. Hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. These results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
TI  - ["In vitro" activity of ten antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. A collaborative study, 1999-2002].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, and azitromycin was assesed against 166 strains of anaerobic bacteria recovered from eight hospitals in Buenos Aires. The strains studied were Bacteroides fragilis group (65), Fusobacterium spp. (26), Prevotella spp. (21), Porphyromonas spp. (10), Clostridium difficile (10), other clostridia (12), and gram-positive cocci (22). The MICs were determined by the agar dilution method according to NCCLS document M11-A5. Metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active antimicrobial agents tested and exhibited MIC90 values of < or = 2 microg/ml and < or = 4 microg/ml against gram-negative organisms, and < or = 2 microg/ml, and < or = 8 microg/ml against gram-positive organisms, respectively. Among beta-lactams the activity against gram-negative rods was in the following order: imipenem > piperacillin > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. Among the gram-positive bacteria the decreased activity was: piperacillin > imipenem > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. The majority of the species studied showed different degrees of resistance to clindamycin and azitromycin. Nevertheless, 90% of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas spp. isolates were inhibited by 0.125 mg/ml of clindamycin and azitromycin, respectively.
TI  - Surveillance of susceptibility patterns in 1297 European and US anaerobic and capnophilic isolates to co-amoxiclav and five other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in Europe and the USA. The co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) MIC(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms of amoxicillin concentration in mg/L) were 0.5/4 for Bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for Prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for Eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for Fingoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for Porphyromonas species. The co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for B. fragilis was 94.6%, for P. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. These data indicate that co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. Among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except E. corrodens (MIC(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/L), which is a capnophilic organism. Imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). Levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against Bacteroides, Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 72.7%, Prevotella 71.5%, F. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 79.5%, Prevotella 92.1%, F. magna 84.7%).
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - Activity of endodontic antibacterial agents against selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of substances used as antibacterial agents (solutions  of 10% calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol - PMCC, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate and 10% castor oil plant detergent) on anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 33563, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124 and Bacteroidesfragilis ATCC 25285), using a broth dilution technique, was evaluated in vitro. For determination of minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericide concentrations (MIC and MBC), two culture broths, Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM) and supplemented Brucella, standardized inoculum and serially diluted solutions were used. All antibacterial agents presented antimicrobial activity that varied for different bacteria. There were no differences in the performance of the two broths. Chlorhexidine digluconate was the most effective, with the lowest MICs, followed by castor oil detergent, PMCC and calcium hydroxide. C. perfringens and B. fragilis were the most resistant bacteria to all agents.
TI  - Antianaerobic activity of a cecropin---melittin peptide.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several small, 15-residue peptides that contain portions of the amino  acid sequences of both cecropin A and melittin have previously been shown to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against aerobic microorganisms, with no undesirable hemolytic properties. It would also be useful to know what effect these hybrid peptides have on anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of one hybrid, CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, were compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against 111 clinical anaerobic strains; Bacteroides fragilis, 24 strains; other Bacteroides fragilis group, 14 strains; other Bacteroides species, 13 strains; Fusobacterium nucleatum, six strains; Clostridium difficile, 22 strains; Clostridium perfringens, 10 strains, Propionibacterium spp., nine strains; and anaerobic cocci, 13 strains. RESULTS: Ninety per cent of strains belonging to the B. fragilis group, fusobacteria, propionibacteria and peptostreptococci were inhibited by 4 mg/L CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, and the antimicrobial activity was approximately in the same range as that of chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This investigation showed that the antimicrobial spectrum of this cecropin---melittin hybrid also includes anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - [Retrospective analysis of Fusobacterium associated infections; experience at Aomori Prefectural Hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  - We experienced 108 cases of Fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at Aomori Prefectural Hospital during The 5 year-period from 1995 to 1999. A total of 433 organisms, included 113 Fusobacterium spp. (80 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 Fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 Fusobacterium varium, 4 Fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 Fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. The remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides fragilis group, Streptococcus milleri group, Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - [Anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients. METHODS: 372 specimens were collected from surgical patients for anaerobe detection. To find a rapid detectable method, 110 specimens were collected for comparative studies by using indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFA), enzyme labeled antibody technique (ELAT) and general cultural method (CM). RESULTS: The isolation rate of anaerobes was rather high in pyothorax (88.9%), abdominal abscess (86.7%), appendicitis (83.9%) and cerebral abscess (all five cases were positive). In burn wounds, the rate was about 23.6% especially in deep burn wounds. Among 212 strains detected, the predominant anaerobes were as follows B. melaninogenicus (28.8%), B. fragilis (25%), F. nucleatum (7.5%), C. perfringens (7.5%), and peptostreptococcus (5.7%); most of them (87.8%) were non-sporing anaerobes. Mixed infection with aerobes accounted for 64%. The survey of rapid detection was conducted in B. fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, C. perfringens, F. nucleatum and peptostreptococcus. The detectable rate was higher in IFA (79.1%) and ELAT (80.9%) than in CM (37.3%). CONCLUSION: IFA and ELAT might be rapid, specific, sensitive, and simple for detecting anaerobes.
TI  - Influence of in-vivo endotoxin liberation on anti-anaerobic antimicrobial efficacy.
AB  - The ability of cefoxitin, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam to cause gram-negative anaerobic bacteria to release endotoxin and the influence of such liberated endotoxin on antibiotic efficacy were investigated in in-vivo experiments in animal models. Experimental infections in various animal models (mice, hamster and infant rats) with cultures of wild and reference strains of Bacteroides fragilis group and Fusobacterium spp. were carried out by injecting these animals with different inocula (10(6), 10(7) and 10(8) cfu/ml) of the bacterial suspension, Appropriate doses of the test antibiotics were then injected and the plasma lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) release measured by the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) Assay. Evidence of worsening of the outcome of the infections post-therapy was assessed, including histopathological changes in the internal organs. Infection with generalized septicemia was established with F. nucleatum in the mice and hamster models while with the B. fragilis group, infections only led to intra-abdominal abscess formation. Plasma endotoxin release was higher in animals infected with F. nucleatum than B. fragilis and was unrelated to the bacterial inoculum. Imipenem, meropenem and cefoxitin, in that order, induced the highest levels of endotoxin activities in the animal model, particularly following F. nucleatum infection. Histological examination of the internal organs of various animals showed variation in the pattern of histopathological changes; grades 3-4 inflammatory changes in the liver were observed in the Fusobacterium-infected animals that were treated with the carbapenems and cefoxitin. Therapy with the other antibiotics did not exacerbate anaerobic sepsis. In this study, bacteremia did not lead to massive endotoxin release and antibiotic therapy appeared not to have negatively influenced the outcome of most of the gram-negative anaerobic infections, except for infections caused by Fusobacterium spp. However, it is conceivable that if the gastrointestinal tract is the source of the endotoxin in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, then the obligate anaerobes like Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species, which are members of the gut flora, may play a major role in the unfavorable outcome of antibiotic therapy in some of these infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. However, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. OBJECTIVE: To determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). Specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; P < 0.01). Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). Other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were Peptostreptococcus micros (66%), Bilophila wadsworthia (63%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (44%), Eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (41%). Of the aerobes Escherichia coli (88%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (former Streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. CONCLUSIONS: The shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. The unusually high frequencies of B. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide induces expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin S, in human cervical smooth-muscle cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vaginal and amniotic infection with gram-negative bacteria is associated with preterm birth. We previously reported that human cervical smooth-muscle cells (CSMC) respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines by expressing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. Our objective was to characterize the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli (E coli), Bacteroides fragilis, (B frag)and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nuc)on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin S, in human CSMC. METHODS: Human CSMC were exposed to LPS and the expression of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin S, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was analyzed by Northern blotting. The effect of cytokine-neutralizing antibodies on LPS-induced cathepsin S mRNA expression also was determined. RESULTS: E coli LPS increased expression of cathepsin S 12.5-fold after 12 hours; MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNAs also were increased 2.9- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL-1)alpha, and IL-1beta mRNAs were markedly up-regulated after 3 hours of LPS treatment. B frag and F nuc LPS also induced TNF-alpha and cathepsin S mRNAs. E coli LPS caused a sevenfold increase in TNF-alpha secretion after 5 to 8 hours. Antihuman TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, but not a monoclonal antibody to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, reduced the LPS-induced increase in cathepsin S mRNA by 27%, whereas neutralizing antibodies against IL-1alpha and IL-1beta did not suppress the response. Human CSMC were shown to express the toll-like receptor (TLR-2) and TLR-4 genes, which mediate the action of LPS. TLR-2 mRNA was up-regulated by TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: CSMC respond to LPS with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin S. Increases in cathepsin S mRNA result only in part from the rapid induction of TNF-alpha gene expression. TNF-alpha may also augment the CSMC response to LPS by increasing expression of the LPS signaling receptor, TLR-2, which probably directly mediates LPS action. These observations provide a mechanism by which gram-negative bacteria can precipitate cervical changes associated with preterm birth.
TI  - Review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - Published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. The studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. Using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against Gram-positive anaerobes (Clostridium perfringens, all Peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against Gram-negative anaerobes. Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides tectum and many Bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/L, while the other species of the B. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. Species variability was evident: Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas macaccae, Prevotella heparinolytica and Prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/L of gemifloxacin while most other Porphyromonas and Prevotella spp. were not. These data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which Gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. may predominate.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Elastase activity of anaerobes isolated from amniotic fluid with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A total of 131 anaerobes isolated from amniotic fluid with preterm premature rupture of membranes and stored were examined for elastolytic activity by the method described by Williams et al (Lett Appl Microbiol 1988;7:173-6). STUDY DESIGN: Each strain was spot inoculated on a Columbia blood agar plate containing 1% solubilized elastin and incubated for 5 days under anaerobic conditions. Undigested elastin was precipitated by flooding trichloroacetic acid solution onto the plate, and a clear zone was visible as the elastolytic reaction around the spot of bacterial growth. RESULTS: Ninety-three (71.0%) of 131 organisms showed a positive elastolytic reaction. Eleven of 20 strains (55.0%) of Peptostreptococcus magnus, 9 of 18 strains (50.0%) of Peptostreptococcus micros, 12 of 12 strains (100.0%) of Fusobacterium nucleatum, 15 of 28 strains (53.6%) of Bacteroides fragilis, 8 of 15 strains (53.3%) of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and 38 of 38 strains (100.0%) of Prevotella bivia were elastolytic. CONCLUSION: Anaerobic bacterial species prevalent in the normal vaginal flora that were isolated from amniotic fluid of women with preterm rupture of membranes produced elastolytic activity, plausibly inducing the destruction of host constitutive components.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - In vitro activity of HMR 3647 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to determine the in vitro activity of HMR 3647 compared with other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. The activity of HMR 3647 was determined against 342 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by the agar dilution method and was compared with azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. Among the macrolides HMR 3647 and among the beta-lactams imipenem were the most active agents tested. Anaerobic cocci (50 strains) had the following minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs): HMR 3647, range 0.016-0.125 mg/l; imipenem, range 0.016-0.064 mg/l. Propionibacterium acnes (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-1.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.032-0.064 mg/l. Clostridium perfringens (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.5 mg/l. Clostridium difficile (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125-256 mg/l; imipenem, 4.0-8.0 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis (102 strains): HMR 3647, 0.032-16 mg/l; imipenem, 0.064-0.25 mg/l. Bacteroides and Prevotella species (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-4.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.25 mg/l. Fusobacterium nucleatum (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-8.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.008-0.064 mg/l. HMR 3647 may be useful as treatment and prophylaxis for infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Pore-forming molecules in gram-negative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Little information is available about porin molecules in anaerobes. Porins from Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Campylobacter species have been described. A pore-forming outer membrane (OM) porin protein was isolated from B. fragilis (Omp-200); it is exposed at the cell surface and dissociated by boiling and application of reducing agents. Fusobacterium nucleatum FomA, an OM porin protein of 40 kD, had a deduced topology of FomA similar to that of established porins, despite the lack of sequence similarity. An OM preparation from Porphyromonas endodontalis (including a major protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD and other proteins of 40.3-71.6 kD) formed pores in a liposome assay. A major outer membrane protein (MOMP) from Campylobacter jejuni (a microaerophile) is related to the family of trimeric bacterial porins, although little homology was seen with other porins. The development of antimicrobial resistance related to decreased permeability underlines the importance of identifying and characterizing the pore-forming molecules of anaerobes.
TI  - Evidence for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in Macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human IgG subclasses.
AB  - This investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of IgG subclass antibody responses in M. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. The IgG response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. The major IgG subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG3, with little, though significant, responses in the IgG4 and IgG2 subclasses. Seventy-five to 94% of the natural IgG antibody in nonhuman primate sera to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus was IgG1. IgG2 and IgG3 predominated to Bacteroides fragilis, IgG4 to Actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact P. gingivalis elicited primarily IgG3 and IgG4, while the post-immunization IgG response to P. intermedia was largely IgG1. Nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from C. rectus and F. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of A. viscosus. The greatest IgG antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive with anti-human IgG1 for all of these antigens except to C. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human IgG2. It appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum IgG subclass antibody responses. The characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - In-vitro activity of clinafloxacin (CI-960) and PD 131628-2 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of two new quinolones, CI-960 and PD 131628-2 were determined against 339 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole. The NCCLS-approved Wadsworth agar dilution technique with Brucella-lysed blood agar was used throughout the study. Breakpoints of the new quinolones are 2 mg/L, and breakpoints for cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole are 32, 8 and 16 mg/L, respectively. CI-960 displayed excellent activity, inhibiting all strains tested at 1 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited 94% of Bacteroides fragilis, 75% of other B. fragilis group isolates, 87% of Prevotella spp, 79% of the Fusobacterium mortiferum-varium group, 74% of non-sporing gram-positive bacilli, and 89-100% of Clostridium spp other than Clostridium difficile at 2 mg/L. None of the eight strains of C. difficile was inhibited at 2 mg/L although they were inhibited at 4 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited all strains of other Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonas spp, and Fusobacterium nucleatum at < or = 1 mg/L.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ICI 194660, CAS 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. They included Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), Prevotella bivia (n = 11), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), Clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated species and genera, e.g. Selenomonas sputigena and Clostridium symbiosum. Bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, Clostridium species, including C. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. Meropenem was especially active against Bacteroides gracilis (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Prevotella disiens (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml), Fusobacterium nucleatum (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml) and Veillonella parvula (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml). The results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - Similarities between Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacteroides fragilis studied by  two DNA probes derived from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified oligonucleotide DNA probe corresponding to a Fusobacterium nucleatum Fevl DNA region coding for a 40-kDa major outer-membrane protein (OMP) and a randomly cloned 2.1 kb DNA probe were found to recognize DNA from the Gram-negative bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis on Southern blots and slot blots. The results indicate sequence similarity within the DNA fragments studied. Immunoblots tested with polyclonal antibodies against whole cells of F. nucleatum revealed only weak antigen similarity between these species.
TI  - Stimulation of B lymphocytes by lipopolysaccharides from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, including those of low endotoxic activity that are isolated from Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas are potent inducers of DNA replication and polyclonal immunoglobulin production in murine B lymphocytes. The activation is dose-dependent and T cell-independent. Replication of DNA and production of immunoglobulins were also stimulated by lipid A and by the LPS heteropolysaccharide that were isolated by mild acid hydrolysis of the LPSs of Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Combinations of LPS, lipid A, and acid-degraded polysaccharide amplified the blastogenic response. Antibodies that react with the polysaccharide part of LPSs isolated from members of the Bacteroidaceae are present in healthy human serum.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - Comparative mitogenicity and polyclonal B cell activation capacity of eight oral  or nonoral bacterial lipopolysaccharides in cultures of spleen cells from athymic (nu/nu-BALB/c) and thymic (BALB/c) mice.
AB  - Optimal stimulatory doses of purified phenol-water extracted lipopolysaccharides  (LPS) from 5 selected strains of 3 putative periodontopathogens (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, and Veillonella), 3 strains of 2 nonoral bacterial species (Bacteroides fragilis and Salmonella enteritidis), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) induced significantly higher maximum mitogenic responses and polyclonal Ig production in cultures of unfractionated spleen cells from nu/nu-BALB/c (nude) than from BALB/c (normal) mice. Compared with PWM, the LPS were stronger mitogens showing relative mitogenic capacities: B. fragilis LPS greater than F. nucleatum LPS greater than S. enteritidis LPS, Veillonella LPS, and P. intermedia LPS. B. fragilis LPS was the most and S. enteritidis LPS the least effective polyclonal B cell activator of total Ig, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA, and IgM secretion. IgG1 was not detected. P. intermedia LPS was the strongest IgA inducer. Kinetic observations indicated mitogenic responses and polyclonal B cell activation in a close sequential order in nude and normal cells. The LPS were potent Ag- and T cell-independent polyclonal B cell activators and LPS of subgingival plaque bacteria may therefore play a nonspecific role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Formation of nitrogen-containing metabolites from geniposide and gardenoside by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - During the course of our studies on the metabolism of iridoid glycosides by human intestinal bacteria, we found that geniposide (1) and gardenoside (4) were transformed to new nitrogen-containing compounds, genipinine (3) and gardenine (6), respectively, along with the known aglycones. Although the amounts of new metabolites were somewhat lower than those of the aglycones, they were quantitatively analyzed by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Of 25 strains of human intestinal bacteria, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaotus produced appreciable amounts of 3, while a bacterial mixture of human feces produced 10 times or more higher amounts of 3, as compared to the individual strains.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - A study of the antigenic composition of the fragilis group of Bacteroides.
AB  - Representative strains of 22 serotypes of the fragilis group of Bacteroides and four non-fragilis control strains of B. melaninogenicus, B. disiens, B. bivius and Fusobacterium nucleatum were tested by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with hyperimmune rabbit sera. SDS-PAGE showed 25 polypeptide bands but, after immunoblotting, 24 antigenic bands were observed in various combinations in all the strains. Three of these were detected only in the control strains, whereas six others were present in different combinations in all strains of the fragilis group but were not present in the controls. Cluster analysis of the antigenic bands showed that the controls were antigenically different from the fragilis group strains. Strains of the fragilis group from the same geographic localities grouped in single clusters; most faecal isolates and NCTC strains appeared separate. There was no correlation between the species of Bacteroides and their antigenic structure. SDS-PAGE with immunoblotting is a superior technique for typing the fragilis group of Bacteroides. Specific antigens have been identified which may be used in the serodiagnosis of infection with these organisms.
TI  - Prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  - Media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. The bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. A similar pattern of results was obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. In all experiments interleukin 1 beta consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. It is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, and blocked penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics through bacterial outer membranes. The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is production of beta-lactamases, which have been found in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium species. beta-Lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is commonly mediated by beta-lactamases that are mainly cephalosporinase in character. B. fragilis strains can also produce penicillinases and enzymes inactivating cefoxitin and imipenem. The non-fragilis species of Bacteroides produce beta-lactamases that are mainly penicillinase in character. Penicillinases are also isolated from Fusobacterium nucleatum. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium clostridioforme, and Clostridium ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.
TI  - [Gene cloning of an Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 antigen that reacts to peripheral blood sera in advanced destructive periodontitis patients].
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) has been implicated in the etiology of juvenile periodontitis and also of advanced destructive periodontitis (ADP). It has been reported that the levels of the IgG antibody against the A.a. in the peripheral blood sera of the ADP patients were often high as well as those against the Bacteroides gingivalis. To clone the genes of antigen reactive to the sera of the ADP patients, we constructed a phage library of the A.a. strain Y4 DNA in lambda L47, which was then screened by the immunochemical detection method using a serum from the ADP patient. Of about 1,000 phage clones six were positive with the serum and also the sera of the other patients, and were named 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively. Restriction enzyme and Southern blot analyses indicated that clones 8 and 9 were identical and that these clones, 3 to 8 were overlapping since they shared in common the 4 kbp and 5kbp Hinc II DNA fragments of the A.a. The cloned DNA fragment hybridized to the DNAs of the two other strains of the A.a. but did not to those of the Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides gigivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Fusobacterium nucleatum. These results suggest that the DNA sequence encoding an A.a. Y4 antigen strongly reactive to the sera of the ADP patients was present specifically in the A.a. but not in the other bacteria isolated from the periodontal patients. Thus, the DNA could serve also as a DNA probe for the diagnosis of periodontitis.
TI  - Standardisation of quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early detection of bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early diagnosis of bacteraemias. Small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. Bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. Blood cultures inoculated with Clostridium perfringens and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. Blood cultures with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group A) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic acids. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. Blood cultures inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within 24 to 48 h of incubation. Since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.
TI  - Enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - Necrobacillosis is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum (FN), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. Their possible role was studied in experiments made with a virulent FN strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously) were given. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with FN suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. Undiluted culture of a strain of Escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of FN to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered E. coli. A heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of E. coli culture had little if any effect on FN. Citrobacter freundii and comparatively small numbers of Corynebacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of E. coli. An alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of FN, though less strikingly than E. coli. FN increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and B. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.
TI  - 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  - The 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were determined for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides capillosus, Bacteroides veroralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Anaerorhabdus furcosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium varium. A dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the 5S rRNA dendrogram, Bacteroides clustered together with Cytophaga and Fusobacterium, as in 16S rRNA analyses. Intraphylum relationships deduced from 5S rRNAs suggested that Bacteroides is specifically related to Cytophaga rather than to Fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16S rRNA analyses. Previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus Bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5S rRNA sequence analysis.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - The synergistic effect of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The synergistic interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against 187 clinically significant anaerobic organisms was investigated. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces odontolyticus, propionibacteria, lactobacilli, peptostreptococci, Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella were sensitive to cefotaxime. Both Eubacterium lentum and Streptococcus morbillorum were resistant. The susceptibility of the clostridia varied from 0.125 to greater than 256 mg/L; only 20% of species demonstrated synergy between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefotaxime against members of the genus Bacteroides ranged from 0.0625 to greater than 256 mg/L. The MIC50 of cefotaxime to Bacteroides fragilis and B. vulgatus was lowered from 6 and 4 mg/L, respectively, to 2 and 1 mg/L, respectively, when 4 mg/L desacetylcefotaxime was added to the medium. Full or partial synergy was demonstrated by 50.7% of the Bacteroides species tested. While cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against many members of the genus Bacteroides, the MIC of at least 10% of strains is not affected by this combination.
TI  - Mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins, and blocking of the penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membranes. The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is the production of beta-lactamase. beta-Lactamases in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium species have been described. beta-Lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is most commonly mediated by the production of beta-lactamase, primarily of the cephalosporinase type. Studies have also shown that B. fragilis can produce a penicillinase that inactivates piperacillin and carbenicillin. Enzymes that inactivate cefoxitin and imipenem have also been found in B. fragilis. The nonfragilis Bacteroides species produce beta-lactamases mainly of the penicillinase type. Recently a penicillinase from Fusobacterium nucleatum has been characterized. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.
TI  - [Sensitivity of anaerobes to 8 antibiotics].
AB  - We studied the susceptibility of 282 obligate anaerobes to 8 antibiotics. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens taken during 1983 and 1984. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a microplate method for 245 strains and agar dilution for 33 Bacteroides asaccharolyticus strains. Tested strains were as follows: 85 Bacteroides fragilis, 71 Clostridium, 19 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 35 Peptostreptococcus, 39 Bacteroides oralis and Bacteroides bivius and 33 Bacteroides asaccharolyticus. Tested antibiotics were: metronidazole, clindamycin, minocycline, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, keflin and carbenicillin. For Bacteroides fragilis, the three most active antibiotics were metronidazole (inhibition of all strains with 8 micrograms/ml), minocycline and clindamycin (inhibition of 95% of strains by MICs less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml). However, four strains were resistant to clindamycin (MICs greater than 8 micrograms/ml). The other anaerobic strains tested were susceptible. However, a few Bacteroides bivius strains were resistant to keflin (MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml for 5% of strains).
TI  - [Activity of cefotetan against anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - We determined the susceptibility to antibiotics of 64 strains of obligate anaerobes. Tested bacterial strains were as follows: 28 Bacteroides fragilis, 22 Fusobacterium nucleatum, 10 Clostridium perfringens, and 4 Bacteroides bivius. Tested antibiotics were cefotetan, cefoxitin and piperacillin. Cefotaxime was tested against 20 Bacteroides fragilis strains. Bacteroides fragilis, which is the most resistant species, was susceptible to cefotetan, cefoxitin and piperacillin, with comparable MICs for these three drugs (0.5 to 16 micrograms/ml); cefotaxime was less effective (MICs = 0.5 to 128 micrograms/ml). Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium perfringens were highly susceptible to cefotetan, cefoxitin and piperacillin.
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - DNA probes for identification of clinically important Bacteroides species.
AB  - Conventional procedures for identifying gram-negative anaerobes such as Bacteroides spp. are cumbersome and time-consuming. A simpler approach would be to use DNA probes to identify these organisms. Since many different species of gram-negative anaerobes are isolated from clinical specimens, the most useful DNA probes would be probes that identify a few clinically significant groups of anaerobes. To obtain such probes, we cloned HindIII-digested chromosomal DNA from various Bacteroides species and then screened these probes, labeled with 32P by nick translation, for hybridization to DNA from various species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and other gram-negative bacteria. We identified three DNA probes (pBFII-4, pBFII-5, and pBFII-6) that hybridized specifically to DNA from Bacteroides fragilis, the species that accounts for about half of all isolates from clinical specimens containing anaerobes. We identified one DNA probe (pBE-3) that hybridized to all members of the B. fragilis group, a group of species that resemble B. fragilis with respect to fermentation pattern and antibiotic resistances. We also identified one probe (pBO-21) that hybridized to DNA from all Bacteroides sp. strains as well as to DNA from strains of Fusobacterium necrophorum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. pBO-21, but not pBE-3, cross-hybridized with a cloned Bacteroides sp. 16S rRNA gene. The limit of detection for these probes was 10(6) bacteria. The probes could detect B. fragilis in blood culture medium and in mixed cultures with other gram-negative bacteria. Attempts to use biotin-labeled DNA probes instead of 32P-labeled probes were not successful because the Bacteroides sp. extracts contained material that bound the streptoavidin-peroxidase detection reagent.
TI  - Serum antibody reactive with predominant organisms in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis.
AB  - In the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (SP). Subjects with SP were often seropositive for Eubacterium brachy, Fusobacterium nucleatum E3C22, and Peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (JP) and subjects with healthy periodontium (HP) were not. Both SP and JP subjects were more frequently seropositive for Bacteroides gingivalis, F. nucleatum D52B16, and F. nucleatum E1D1 than were HP subjects. The data were most striking for B. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for SP and JP subject groups. However, SP subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. In contrast, JP and HP subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. Except at very low levels of antibody, neither SP nor JP groups differed significantly from the HP group for antibody to Eubacterium nodatum, Bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or Lactobacillus minutus antibody. There was a high frequency of antibody to E. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite the fact that this organism is rarely found in HP subjects. For Eubacterium timidum, the JP group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the HP group. Despite high levels of L. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 SP subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the HP and JP subjects had detectable antibody. These results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. B. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. However, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., L. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.
TI  - Establishment of MICs of moxalactam for control and reference anaerobic organisms in agar dilution and microdilution techniques.
AB  - The MICs of moxalactam were determined for eight National Committee for Clinical  Laboratory Standards control and reference strains and for Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953 by agar and microdilution techniques. The recommended MIC for the control strain Bacteroides fragilis in both agar and microdilution tests is 0.5 micrograms/ml. Recommended MICs for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 and Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124 by agar dilution are 8 and 0.063 micrograms/ml, respectively. These two strains gave inconsistent results in microdilution tests. Variation in results with microdilution procedures was seen, which illustrates problems in reading endpoints and with modifications of media. Recommended MICs for the reference strains are presented.
TI  - Beta-lactamases in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins and blocked penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membranes. The most important factor in beta-lactam resistance is production of beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamases in various Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Clostridium species have been described. Beta-lactam resistance in Bacteroides fragilis is most commonly mediated by beta-lactamase production mainly of cephalosporinase character. Recent studies have also shown that B. fragilis can produce a penicillinase which inactivates piperacillin and carbenicillin. Enzymes inactivating cefoxitin and imipenem have also been isolated from B. fragilis. The Bacteroides non-fragilis species produce beta-lactamases of mainly penicillinase character. Recently a penicillinase from Fusobacterium nucleatum has been characterized. Among the clostridia, Clostridium butyricum, C. clostridiiformis and C. ramosum have been shown to produce penicillinases.
TI  - Adhesion of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria to mucosal surfaces.
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum and black-pigmented Bacteroides species adhere to red blood cells and crevicular epithelium. The attachment of the bacteroides, but not F. nucleatum, is associated with the presence of fimbriae-like structures on the bacterial surface. Such structures have been observed also in unencapsulated Bacteroides fragilis able to adhere to human red cells and cheek epithelium. Encapsulated B. fragilis adheres to porcine brush borders, but the number of adhering cells per brush border fragment is low.
TI  - Nature and location of amide-bound (R)-3-acyloxyacyl groups in lipid A of lipopolysaccharides from various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - It has previously been demonstrated [Eur. J. Biochem. 124, 191-198 (1982) and 137, 15-22 (1983)] that the lipid A component of Salmonella and Proteus lipopolysaccharides contains amide-linked (R)-3-acyloxyacyl residues. In the present study lipid A of other gram-negative bacteria was analysed for the presence of amide-bound 3-acyloxyacyl residues. It was found that such residues are constituents of all lipid A tested (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas sinensis, Bacteroides fragilis, Vibrio cholerae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Rhodospirillum tenue, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Escherichia coli). Amide-linked (R)-3-acyloxyacyl groups, therefore, represent common and ubiquitous structural elements of bacterial lipid A. The composition of 3-acyloxyacyl groups differed considerably among different bacteria. As amide-bound (R)-3-hydroxy fatty acids straight chain and isobranched acyl groups with 10-17 carbon atoms were identified. The most frequently encountered fatty acids, substituting the 3-hydroxyl group of 3-hydroxy fatty acids, were nonhydroxylated straight chain and isobranched acyl residues with 10-17 carbon atoms as well as (S)-2-hydroxy fatty acids with 12 carbon atoms. In some cases, using laser desorption mass spectrometry, the distribution of 3-acyloxyacyl residues over the two available glucosamine amino groups of the lipid A backbone was investigated.
TI  - The pathogenic properties of Fusobacterium and Bacteroides species from wallabies and other sources.
AB  - Intracerebral inoculation was more effective than intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation as a means of producing lethal infections with Fusobacterium necrophorum in mice. Strains varied in virulence but, of five examined, two had LD50 values as low as ca. 8000 and 14000 viable organisms. Profuse bacterial multiplication in the brain was demonstrated. Intravenous vaccination with a single large dose of heat-killed whole culture or washed bacterial cells failed to protect against intracerebral challenge. Intracerebral injection of other fusobacteria (F. nucleatum, F. varium and F. necrogenes) and of 22 strains belonging to 10 Bacteroides spp. was without apparent effect on mice, except for a slight transient illness in some animals given B. fragilis. This organism (five strains) differed from the other Bacteroides spp. tested, which included eight strains belonging to the fragilis group, in being eliminated more slowly from the mouse brain--a point that may be relevant to the special pathogenicity of B. fragilis in endogenous infections in man. There was no evidence that B. fragilis multiplied in the brain or that intravenous vaccination with a large dose of heat-killed homologous culture affected the rate at which it was eliminated.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from vented blood-culture bottles.
AB  - From January 1979, to July 1981, blood from each patient suspected of having bacteremia was collected in two bottles of commercially prepared tryptic soy broth; one bottle was vented for 24 hr to the atmosphere. Bottles were incubated at 37 degrees C for a maximum of seven days and were examined daily for signs of growth. Blind subcultures onto chocolate-agar plates were performed 18-24 hr after collection and again at 48 hr. For 63,106 bottles inoculated, a total of 4,788 strains were isolated, for a rate of 6.4% (excluding contaminants). Two hundred and thirty (4.8%) isolates were anaerobes, of which 75 (33%) were identified as Bacteroides fragilis. It is significant that 20 of these anaerobic isolates (approximately 9%) were recovered only from the vented bottles. These included eight strains of B. fragilis; three strains of Clostridium perfringens; and one strain each of Bacteroides distasonis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus saccharolyticus, and Eubacterium species. These results emphasize the need to check vented bottles for anaerobes, since significant numbers of these bacteria could be missed by failing to do so. These data further show the desirability of holding anaerobic blood cultures for a minimum of one week.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of four antibiotics in anaerobic pulmonary infection. An experimental model in rabbits.
AB  - The efficacy of cefoxitin, mezlocillin, latamoxef and metronidazole in anaerobic  lung infection was studied using a rabbit model. A mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus morbillorum, Eubacterium lentum and Fusobacterium nucleatum was inoculated transtracheally to produce infection within the lung. Mezlocillin was most effective, achieving bacteriologic cure in 5 out of 8 animals. With cefoxitin therapy, 4 out of 8 became bacteriologically sterile. Severe diarrhea with elevated titers of Clostridium difficile toxin was noted in most cefoxitin-treated animals. Latamoxef- and metronidazole-treated animals had apparently healed lesions, but cultures were positive in 6 and 7 out of 8 in each group, respectively. The commonest pathogen isolated in the last two groups was P. morbillorum. The therapeutic superiority of mezlocillin over metronidazole and latamoxef was statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05).
TI  - Penicillin failure in the treatment of Bacteroides fragilis lung abscess. Experimental study in rabbits.
AB  - Carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and clindamycin were compared with penicillin for the treatment of lung abscess in an animal model produced by transtracheal inoculation of a mixture of anaerobes: Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus morbillorum, Eubacterium lentum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Both chloramphenicol and doxycycline eliminated the bacteria but failed to close the abscess cavity. Carbenicillin, although it eradicated B. fragilis, failed to close the abscess cavity in 3 of 6 animals. In all animals tested, clindamycin sterilized the abscess cavities and healed the lung abscesses, while penicillin failed to eradicate the infection. Clindamycin was significantly more effective than penicillin in the elimination of anaerobic bacteria from the lung (p less than 0.05). Clindamycin also closed the abscess cavity faster than penicillin (p less than or equal to 0.02). The superior efficacy of clindamycin may have been the result of accumulation in the lung tissue in concentrations four- to eightfold higher than in the serum.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Pathogenic anaerobes.
AB  - Anaerobes are prevalent on all mucosal surfaces and virtually all anaerobic infections are endogenous. Two thirds of anaerobic infections involve five anaerobic organisms or groups--the Bacteroides fragilis group, the Bacteroides melaninogenicus-Bacteroides asaccharolyticus group, Fusobacterium nucleatum, the anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium perfringens. Conditions that lower the oxidation-reduction potential and disrupt the mucosal surface (eg, vascular problems, malignant neoplasms, and surgery) lead to infection with anaerobes. Clues to anaerobic infection include foul odor, gas, tissue destruction, underlying malignant neoplasms, and the unique appearance of certain anaerobes on Gram's stain. Specimens must be collected to avoid normal flora and transported to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions. Therapy involves surgical debridement and drainage and the use of various antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents must be used for extended periods to avoid relapse.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - [Antibiotic treatment of human actinomykoses (author's transl)].
AB  - In the complex aetiology of human actinomykoses, various Actinomyces species, especially A. israelii, play the pathogenetically leading role in the mixed flora so typical for these diseases. A number of other microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria are also part of such mixed flora. Since these "concomitant" bacteria are themselves potentially pathogenic, it is important to have data on antibiotic sensitivity for the entire spectrum of microorganisms, to achieve effective and economic chemotherapy of human actinomykoses. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined for Actinomyces and the most important concomitant bacteria from actinomykotic processes: Actinobacillus actinomycetem-commitants, Bacteroides of the Melaninogenicus group, B. fragilis, B. theta-iotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium spp. and Propionibacteria. The results indicate that aminopenicillines are the drug of first choice, if in the actinomykoses there are no Bacteroides strains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. These tests further indicate that clinically the combination of aminopenicillin and clindamycin, as well as aminopenicillin and metronidazol, are indicated. Minocycline and especially cefoxitin, a beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporin, inhibit with few exceptions all bacteria which are potentially involved in actinomykotic processes.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
TI  - Chemoprophylaxis of anaerobic pulmonary infections. An experimental study in rabbits.
AB  - Chemoprophylaxis of anaerobic pulmonary infection due to aspiration was studied in a rabbit model with the view of comparing the efficacy of procaine penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline and cefoxitin. The antibiotic treatment was commenced immediately following transtracheal inoculation of a mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus morbillorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eubacterium lentum. Treatment was stopped after 48 h and lungs were examined for evidence of infection on the 10th day. Only clindamycin and carbencillin were highly efficacious in chemoprophylaxis and both drugs prevented pulmonary infection in 7 of 8 (87%) of the animals tested.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - Animal model for anaerobic lung abscess.
AB  - There are no satisfactory animal models for the study of anaerobic lung abscess.  Aspiration of food, gastric mucin, or hydrochloric acid, or any combination of these, along with oropharyngeal bacteria, is commonly believed to cause aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess. In the animal model described, none of the adjuvants was effective in producing anaerobic lung abscesses. Anaerobic bacteria derived from dental scrapings of a healthy adult (Peptococcus morbillorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium lentum, and Bacteroides fragilis), when inoculated transtracheally without any adjuvants into New Zealand male white rabbits, consistently produced lung abscesses. Neither B fragilis by itself nor a mixture of P. morbillorum, F. nucleatum, and E. lentum without the addition of B. fragilis produced lung abscesses. The bacterial isolates used in this study were stored in prereduced chopped-meat-glucose medium and subcultured several times and were found effective in reproducing anaerobic lung abscesses repeatedly. This animal model is suitable for the study of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of B. fragilis-associated anaerobic lung abscess.
TI  - Microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with Streptococcus and Bacteroides.
AB  - Oral strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (HA) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of HA-active F. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. HA-active sonicated fragments (SF) prepared from F. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. Attachment of F. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the HA activity of the SF in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. HA activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of F. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment. Of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed F. nucleatum HA-active fragments. They included Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, Bacteroides corrodens, Streptococcus morbillorum, Streptococcus sanguis (Blackburn and JC 74) and Streptococcus mutans AHT, BHT, 10449 and 6715. Chelators revealed that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a Ca2+-dependent interaction. Sugar inhibition demonstrated that F. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a D-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. A reduction in the absorption of F. nucleatum HA-active fragments by Strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  - Forty-two children with decubitus ulcers were studied using aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 (50%) of the patients, five times as the only isolates and 16 times mixed with aerobes. Aerobes only were present in 20 (48%) of the patients. There were a total of 83 isolates, 46 aerobes and 37 anaerobes, with an average of two species per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.9 anaerobes). The predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci (17), Bacteroides fragilis (6), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (4). The most common aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (23), Group A beta hemolytic streptococci (6), Hemophilus influenzae (5), and Enterobacter agglomerans (5). The polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children is demonstrated.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 Bacteroides sp (11 in the B fragilis group); four anaerobic Gram-positive cocci; four Clostridium sp; four Propionibacterium acnes; and three Fusobacterium sp. No aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. The gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to Bacteroides organisms, four to Clostridium sp, and one to F nucleatum. The ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to Peptococcus sp and two to Fusobacterium sp. Five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by B fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by P acnes. The average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). The early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.
TI  - Susceptibility of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Fusobacteria in Antibacterial agents.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 45 antimicrobial agents were established by the agar dilution method for 37 strains of Bacteroidaceae: Bacteroides fragilis (18 strains), B. thetaiotaomicron (8 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (6 strains), and Fusobacterium spp. (5 strains). The fusobacteria tested showed good susceptibility to beta-lactam-antibiotics, tetracyclines, lincomycins, and nitroimidazole compounds. Bacteria of the B. fragilis group were resistant to most of the penicillins and cephalosporins and could not be suppressed with certainty by nitroimidazoles and older tetracyclines. Doxycycline and minocycline, however, showed sufficient activity, and all our Bacteroides strains tested were sensitive to clindamycin. Especially the good in vitro susceptibility of all Bacteroidaceae strains investigated to cefoxitin may offer new therapeutic possibilities.
TI  - Bacterial colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia following tracheostomy and long-term intubation in pediatric patients.
AB  - Serial tracheal cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from 27 pediatric patients during one year of follow-up. The patients had required tracheostomy and prolonged intubation for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months (average, 7 1/2 months). Cultures of tracheal aspirates yielded 1,508 isolates of pathogenic aerobic (969 isolates) and anaerobic (539 isolates) bacteria. The most frequent aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis. Replacement of one pathogen by another occurred frequently. Tracheobronchitis occurred in 24 patients, all of whom had episodes of pneumonia. The data suggest that anaerobic bacteria are a part of the bacterial flora in colonization, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia in patients with tracheostomy and prolonged intubation.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  - The survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. Fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. Clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. Peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and Streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. These diluents could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Clindamycin in treatment of aspiration pneumonia in children.
AB  - Twenty-eight patients with anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections were treated with clindamycin alone or clindamycin with gentamicin. Sixteen of the patients presented with pneumonitis, nine with necrotizing pneumonia, and three with lung abscesses. The average length of treatment was 13.8 days, and the duration of temperature after initiation of therapy was 3.1 days. The predominant isolates were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (23 isolates), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14), Bacteroides fragilis (9), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (11). The most frequent aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (12), Diplococcus pneumoniae (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (5), Staphylococcus aureus (9), and Escherichia coli (6). All patients responded to the therapy and were cured of the infection. There were no side effects observed from the administration of clindamycin. None of the patients developed any blood dyscrasia, liver damage, diarrhea, or colitis. Clindamycin appears to be effective in the treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections in children, alone or with an aminoglycoside when indicated.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 HFU), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  - The susceptibility of more than 40 strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (Sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. The influences of density of the inoculum upon MICs was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. splanchnicus, B. oralis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium fusiforme (F. nucleatum), Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Clostridium perfringens, C. fallax, Propionibacterium acnes and several species of Peptococcaceae showed broth dilution MICs of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. Members of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of S. varius had a broth dilution MIC of 256 microgram/ml. With most strains, the agar dilution MICs were 2 similar to 4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution MICs. In pour plate-tests, the MICs were not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. With most anaerobes, the MBCs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the MICs. The results obtained indicated that, apart from S. varius, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including B. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.
TI  - The bacteriology of cavitating pulmonary infections and empysema. Studies of transtracheal aspirates and pleural fluid.
AB  - A prospective study of bacteriology in 14 cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema is reported. Bacteriologic results were based on transtracheal aspirates or pleural fluid. Appropriate anaerobic bacteriologic methods were employed. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 11 patients (79%); they were the only pathogens isolated in 6 patients. The predominant species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Aerobic bacteria were present in 7 patients. The results indicate that anaerobes play a key role in most cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema, and that proper culture of adequat specimens will generally establish the bacteriological diagnosis.
TI  - Lethality for mice and chick embryos, pyrogenicity in rabbits and ability to gelate lysate from amoebocytes of Limulus polyphemus by lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and Veillonella.
AB  - Phenol-water extracted lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Veillonella, Fusobacterium  nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were lethal for mice and 11-days-old chick embryos, pyrogenic in rabbits, and gelated Limulus amoebocyte lysate. Mouse lethality was considerably enhanced by actinomycin-D. In all test systems the endotoxin activity of Veillonella and Fusocbacterium LPS was comparable to that of LPS from Salmonella enteritidis, which was included as a reference endotoxin. The endotoxicity of the Bacteroides LPS was very low. While nanograms of the Veillonella and Fusobacterium LPS killed the chick embryos and gelated the Limulus lysates, microgram amounts of the Bacteroides LPS were needed to give positive reaction in the same test systems. As much as 74 microgram of the most active B. fragilis LPS were required to give a typical biphasic fever response in rabbits. A significant correlation was found between all test results (r = 0.90-0.98, p less than 0.001).
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of bacteroidaceae to cefoxitin and cephalothin (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of the new cephamycin C derivatives cefoxitin against 102 clinical isolates of Bacteroidaceae (95 Bacteroides strains and 7 Fusobacterium-Sphaerophorus cultures) was determined by tube dilution and standardized agar diffusion tests and compared to that of cephalothin. Cefoxitin was more active than cephalothin against 56 Bacteroides fragilis strains, 19 Bacteroides thetaiota-omicron strains and two Bacteroides splanchnicus strains. The difference seemed less pronounced with five Bacteroides vulgatus and four Bacteroides variabilis cultures. Three Bacteroides melaninogenicus and six Bacteroides oralis strains displayed similar sensitivity to both cephalosporins. At concentrations of 32 microng/ml or less, cefoxitin inhibited 91% and cephalothin 33% of the Bacteroides strains. Two strains of Sphaerophorus varius were likewise much more sensitive to cefoxitin than to cephalothin (MIC values 8 micron8/ml of cefoxitin and 256 microng/ml of cephalothin). Three other Sphaerophorus strains (the species necrophorus and freundii/mortiferum) and two of Fusobacterium fusiforme (Fusobacterium nucleatum) strains were very similar in their susceptibility to both cephalosporins. Statistical analysis of the relationship between MIC and zone size diameter showed relatively high correlation coefficients for cefoxitin and cephalothin (r=-0.741 and r=-0.703 respectively).
TI  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel and the rate of gas flow. Cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus sp. and Propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. All cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours then incubated in a GasPak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared to incubation only in the GasPak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
TI  - Effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
TI  - Rosamicin: in vitro activity against anaerobes and comparison with erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of rosamicin was determined against 231 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of erythromycin against the same strains. Rosamicin and erythromycin had similar activity against strains of Peptostreptococcus and gram-positive nonsporeforming bacilli. Rosamicin was somewhat more active against strains of Peptococcus, Clostridium, and gram-negative anaerobes. All strains of Bacteroides fragilis tested were inhibited by 4 mug of rosamicin or less per ml, whereas only 76% of them were inhibited by this concentration of erythromycin. Rosamicin was distinctly more active against Fusobacterium nucleatum. Because of its in vitro activity, further investigation of the pharmacology of this drug is warranted.
TI  - Hyperbaric oxygen exposures for intrahepatic abscesses produced in mice by nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen exposures were evaluated for treatment of progressive liver abscesses produced by intraperitoneal injection of combined cultures of Fusobacterium necrophorum plus either Bacteroides fragilis subsp. fragilis or Fusobacterium nucleatum in a mouse model. Infected control and hyperbaric oxygen-exposed mice were autopsied 5 or 6 weeks after inoculation of bacteria and were assigned numerical pathology scores according to the number and size of abscesses present. Seventeen daily 3-h exposures to 100% O(2) at 2 atmospheres absolute pressure begun either 1 day or 1 week after injection of bacteria significantly reduced the number and size of abscesses among mice infected with either mixture of anaerobic organisms. Abscesses due to mixed fusobacteria were often completely resolved. These data support the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen for treatment of mixed anaerobic infection produced by Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species and suggest its further evaluation as a potential alternate or adjunct to present therapy for certain types of serious anaerobic infection.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO(2) levels greater than 0.5%. Species that were found to be strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., Clostridium haemolyticum, Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
TI  - Effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  - In the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. Of the species tested, Bacteroides oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium difficile, a Neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. A group K streptococcus and B. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. Mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. A Peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. When this strain was combined with two Clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. This polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. No net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
