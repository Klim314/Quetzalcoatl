TI  == cultivable endophytic bacteria from leaf bases of agave tequilana and their role  as plant growth promoters.
AB  == agave tequilana weber var. 'azul' is grown for the production of tequila, inulin  and syrup. diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. in this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy agave tequilana plants. in plant tissue  bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million cfu/g of fresh plant  tissue. three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16s rdna sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as acinectobacter sp., a. baumanii, a. bereziniae, cronobacter sakazakii, enterobacter hormaechei,  bacillus sp. klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas sp., enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and gluconobacter oxydans. isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (pgpb) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or  antagonism against fusarium oxysporum ac132. e. casseliflavus jm47 and k. oxytoca jm26 secreted the highest concentrations of iaa. the endophyte acinectobacter sp. jm58 exhibited the maximum values for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization index (psi). inhibition of fungi was found in pseudomonas sp. jm9p and k. oxytoca jm26. bacterial endophytes show promise for use as bio-inoculants  for agave cultivation. use of endophytes to enhance cultivation of agave may be particularly important for plants produced by micropropagation techniques, where  native endophytes may have been lost.

TI  == isolation of alkaliphilic bacteria for production of high optically pure l-(+)-lactic acid.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria that grow under alkaline conditions (ph 10) were isolated from various sources in okinawa (japan). these alkali-tolerant and alkaliphilic bacteria were classified as follows: microbacterium sp. (1 strain), enterococcus  spp. (9 strains), alkalibacterium spp. (3 strains), exiguobacterium spp. (5 strains), oceanobacillus spp. (3 strains) and bacillus spp. (7 strains) by 16s rrna gene sequencing. by fermentation, many strains were able to convert glucose  into mainly l-(+)-lactic acid of high optical purity in alkaline broth. this result indicated that valuable l-(+)-lactic acid-producing bacteria could be isolated efficiently by screening under alkaline conditions. six strains were selected and their ability to produce lactic acid at different initial ph was compared. enterococcus casseliflavus strain 79w3 gave the highest lactic acid concentration. lactic acid concentration and productivity were 103 g l(-1) (optical purity of 99.5% as l-isomer) and 2.2 g l(-1) h(-1), respectively when 129 g l(-1) of glucose was used by batch fermentation.
