TI  - Multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  - Clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. The crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. Concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. Comparable numbers of Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Neisseria subflava, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. Quantitative fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. Biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific fluorescent stains. Anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm EPS and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (P < 0.05). Sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm EPS in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (P < 0.05). CLSM demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm EPS, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (P < 0.05). Agents in oral hygiene formulations (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (P < 0.05). Multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm EPS and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16S  ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
AB  - This paper reports a case of Haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of H. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. In the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with Streptococcus intermedius and S. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. In the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with Clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. Both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress C in air with CO2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. Both strains were factor V-dependent, but not factor X-dependent. For the first isolate, the Vitek system (NHI) showed that it was 56% likely to be Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% Neisseria subflava; whereas the API system (NH) showed that it was 58% likely to be H. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% H. parainfluenzae. For the second isolate, the Vitek system (NHI) showed that it was 95% likely to be H. influenzae VIII; whereas the API system (NH) showed that it was 58% likely to be H. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% H. parainfluenzae. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and H. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and H. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of H. segnis. Only two cases of H. segnis bacteraemia were found in the English scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. Including the present two cases, the overall mortality of H. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.
TI  - Nitrate- and nitrite-reducing bacteria in the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  - The microbial composition of samples of gastric juice from eight achlorhydric patients was determined by aerobic and rigorously anaerobic culture techniques. Bacteria from 16 genera were commonly isolated, but representatives of only three genera, (streptococci, neisseriae and haemophili) were isolated from every patient. Nitrate and nitrite were both reduced by veillonellae, haemophili, staphylococci, corynebacteria, lactobacilli, flavobacteria and fusobacteria, but the potential rate of nitrate reduction by suspensions of veillonellae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and members of the Enterobacteriaceae were up to ten times more rapid than the rate of nitrite reduction. Conversely, although all Neisseria spp. reduced nitrite only some strains reduced nitrate. Streptococci did not reduce nitrate. Streptococcus sanguis reduced nitrite when grown with haematin; other streptococci did not reduce nitrite. Bacterial nitrate and nitrite reduction were active over the pH range 6-8, similar to the pH range of the achlorhydric stomach. From a knowledge of the composition of the bacterial flora and their potential rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction under prevailing conditions, predictions were made about the tendency of nitrite to accumulate during nitrate reduction. Studies of the transient accumulation of nitrite by mixed cultures of H. parainfluenzae and N. subflava were consistent with these predictions. Haemophili and veillonellae could be responsible for the accumulation of nitrite in the gastric juice of some patients, whereas streptococci and neisseriae would tend to remove nitrite from the stomach as rapidly as it formed.
TI  - Nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  - Binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. Suspensions of Veillonella parvula and Haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing Neisseria subflava or Streptococcus sanguis. The maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. This ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. These results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.
TI  - Bacteriolytic action of fluoride ions.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria subflava, and LYT coccus were found to undergo massive lysis after growth in media containing 0.01 to 10 mM NaF. When cells of these organisms were transferred from late-exponential-phase cultures to 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer plus 0.1 M KCl, they underwent spontaneous autolysis. Cells grown in media with fluoride were more liable to autolysis, and walls isolated from them also showed enhanced autolytic sensitivity, even though added fluoride did not directly stimulate autolysins. Sporadic or partial lysis occurred in populations of Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans BHT or LM-7 after growth in fluoridated media. Most bacteria that were tested did not undergo fluoride-induced lysis. However, cells of all test bacteria were found to have reduced amounts of peptidoglycan per unit of cell weight when grown in the presence of fluoride. Incorporation of labeled lysine or glucosamine into peptidoglycan (Park-Hancock residue) was stimulated, instead of inhibited, by fluoride. However, fluoride also stimulated the loss of radioactivity from Park-Hancock residues of cells that had previously incorporated labeled lysine or glucosamine. Thus, fluoride appeared to enhance peptidoglycan turnover, and this turnover reduced the peptidoglycan contents of all bacteria tested, but induced lysis in only those bacteria that normally have highly active autolytic systems.
