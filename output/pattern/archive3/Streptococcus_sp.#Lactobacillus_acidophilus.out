inhibitory effects of antiseptic mouthrinses on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus acidophilus.
background: oral antiseptics are valuable in controlling oral infections caused by cariogenic bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mouthrinses and pure antiseptic compounds on streptococcus mutans and non-mutans bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus acidophilus). methods: the agar diffusion assay was employed to determine bacterial growth inhibition. results: commercial mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.05%) and sodium fluoride (0.05%) produced statistically similar growth inhibition of s. mutans, s. sanguinis and l. acidophilus (with zones of inhibition ranging from 7.56 +/- 0.52 mm to 7.39 +/- 0.53 mm, 17.44 +/- 0.94 mm to 18.31 +/- 0.62 mm and 8.61 +/- 1.43 to 8.67 +/- 1.43 mm respectively, p > 0.05). the chlorhexidine mouthwash produced the greatest mean growth inhibition of s. sanguinis and s. mutans compared to all other mouthrinses tested (p < 0.01). the minimum concentrations at which inhibition against s. mutans could be detected were chlorhexidine gluconate at 0.005% (wt/vol), cetylpyridinium chloride 0.01% (wt/ vol), povidone iodine 10% (wt/vol) and sodium hypochlorite 0.5% (vol/vol). conclusions: chlorhexidine (0.01%), cetylpyridinium chloride (0.01%), povidone iodine (10%) and sodium hypochlorite (0.5%) are effective at inhibiting the growth of s. mutans, s. sanguinis and l. acidophilus.
construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.
intensity and duration of in-vitro antibacterial activity of different adhesives  used in orthodontics.
this work investigated the antibacterial activity of 14 bonding agents to predict their ability to inhibit white-spot development during orthodontic treatment. standardized, sterilized disks of each material were continuously rinsed (for up to 180 d) in a flow of sterile saline. at predetermined time points, the residual ability of each material to inhibit bacterial growth (determined by measuring the size of inhibition halos around disks placed onto appropriate culture media seeded with streptococcus gordonii dsm6777, streptococcus sanguinis dsm20567, streptococcus mutans dsm20523, or lactobacillus acidophilus dsm20079) and biofilm formation (determined by measuring the numbers of bacteria adherent to disks following incubation in appropriate broths) was tested in triplicate and compared with the baseline activities of freshly prepared materials. overall antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities, adjusted for exposure time and strain of bacteria, were assessed. the decrease of antibacterial activity was faster (30-60 d) and complete for fluoride-enriched materials, but slower (90 d) and partial for antimicrobial-containing materials (benzalkonium chloride, zinc oxide, chlorexidine, or mdpb). materials enriched with benzalkonium chloride, chlorexidine, or mdpb showed the highest antibacterial activities. anti-biofilm assays yielded similar results. these data could be helpful for clinicians in the choice of the best performing bonding agent also in light of duration of the clinical application.
comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effects of four dentine bonding systems: an in vitro study.
aim: the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and the compare antibacterial efficacy of four dentin bonding system against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus acidophilus over a period of three months using agar disk diffusion test. methodology: all the three standard bacterial strains were inoculated into bhi broth and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. a 100 mul of broth suspension containing aliquots of s. mutans, s. salivarius and l. acidophilus were spread onto m-h agar medium using sterile cotton swabs. the experimental groups were as follows: group a: test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against s. mutans mtcc 497, group b: test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against s. salivarius mtcc 1938, and group c: test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against l. acidophilus mtcc 447. for sample preparation, 20 mul bonding agent was dropped with micropipettes on paper disks, and blown dry for 10 seconds. then it was light-cured at 2 mm for 20 sec using a qth visible light curing unit. for first reading, the sample disks were placed over the freshly inoculated agar plates and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. the rest of the paper disks were stored in dark, submerged in distilled water at 37 degrees c. they were placed on freshly inoculated spread plates after specific time intervals- 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after ageing in pbs. after incubation, the diameters of zones of inhibition around the plates were measured. the experiment was performed twice in triplicate. the data was then statistically analysed using two way anova test and post hoc. results: results showed that xeno iii had the maximum antibacterial efficacy over a period of three months, followed by xp bond. this antibacterial activity was maximum against streptococcus mutans, followed by lactobacillus acidophilus and least against streptococcus salivarius. adper easy one and g bond had minimal effect against the test bacteria during the test period. conclusion: the antibacterial effect decreased over a period of three months for all the dentin bonding systems.
isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus), gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.
competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
antibacterial activity of triclosan incorporated glass ionomer cements--an in vitro pilot study.
objectives: the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cement impregnated with different concentrations (0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5%) of a non releasing bactericide--triclosan (tc) against two common cariogenic bacteria - lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans; and to compare triclosan incorporated gic with chlorhexidine (chx) incorporated gic (2.5%) in terms of antibacterial activity. methods: chlorhexidine or triclosan were added to glass ionomer cement powder to achieve 2.5% chx--gic (positive control--group ii), 0.5%, 1.25% and 2.5% tc-gic (experimental groups iii, iv and v respectively) formulations. restorative glass ionomer cement (fuji ix gc--group i) served as negative control. the powder and liquid were mixed and inserted into the wells punched in agar plates (10 mm x 4 mm). the agar diffusion method was used to determine the antibacterial activity of the cements after 1, 7 and 30 days. mean values were compared between different study groups using one-way anova and tukey's hsd procedure at a significance level of 5%. results: triclosan incorporated gic was more effective against l. acidophilus and s. mutans than chlorhexidine incorporated gic. triclosan at a concentration of 2.5% was more effective than at lower concentrations. at all time periods studied, the maximum zone of inhibition against l. acidophilus was produced by group v. against s. mutans, on days 1, 7 and 30, there was no significant difference between groups ii and iv (p > 0.05), while the other groups showed significant differences. conclusion: the use of triclosan as an antibacterial additive in gic holds promise and further clinical research is needed in this direction.
lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 increases lactacin b production when it senses live target bacteria.
lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. production of bacteriocin by l. acidophilus la-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. however, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. this study demonstrates that l. acidophilus la-5 produces lactacin b and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide ip_1800. the transcript level of the lactacin b gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between l. acidophilus la-5 and s. thermophilus sty-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbab) transcription was observed. however, lbab was transcribed constitutively in uninduced l. acidophilus la-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. a new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced l. acidophilus la-5. these results showed that part of lactacin b secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.
effects of natural cross-linkers on the stability of dentin collagen and the inhibition of root caries in vitro.
purpose: to evaluate the effects of dentin collagen modifications induced by various cross-linkers on the stability of collagen matrix and the inhibition of root caries. materials and methods: the following cross-linkers were tested: 5% glutaraldehyde (ga), 0.5% proanthocyanidin (pa), 0.625% genipin (ge). in the first experiment, cross-linker-treated demineralized human root dentin was digested with bacterial collagenase, centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to amino acid analysis to determine collagen content. the residues were analyzed by sds-page and hydroxyproline analysis. in the second experiment, bovine root surfaces were conditioned with phosphoric acid, treated with the cross-linkers, incubated with streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus for 1 week and the root caries inhibition was evaluated with confocal microscopy. lastly, the ability of the bacteria to colonize the root surface was evaluated. in this experiment slabs of bovine root were treated with the cross-linkers and incubated in a suspension of s. mutans and l. acidophilus. the slabs were washed, resuspended in water, glucose was added, and the ph measured. results: while all collagen was digested with collagenase in the control groups, only a small proportion was solubilized in the ga-, pa-, and ge-treated groups. the root caries was significantly inhibited by treatment with pa or ga. drops in ph in the cross-linker-treated groups were essentially the same as in the untreated group. conclusion: naturally occurring cross-linkers, especially pa, could be used to modify root dentin collagen to efficiently stabilize collagen and to increase its resistance against caries.
studies on bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus acidophilus, as potential probiotics, on the immune response and resistance of tilapia nilotica (oreochromis niloticus) to challenge infections.
the probiotic activity of two bacteria (bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus acidophilus) was evaluated by its effect on the immune response of nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus), beside its protective effect against challenge infections. furthermore, their in-vitro inhibitory activity was evaluated. the in-vitro antimicrobial assay showed that bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the growth of a. hydrophila. the b. subtilis inhibited the development of p. fluorescens while l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of strept. iniae. the b. subtilis and l. acidophilus proved harmless when injected in the o. niloticus. the feed, containing a mixture of b. subtilis and l. acidophilus or b. subtilis alone, showed significantly greater numbers of viable cells than feed containing l. acidophilus only after 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks of storage at 4 degrees c and 25 degrees c. the survival rate and the body-weight gain were significantly increased in the fish given b. subtilis and l. acidophilus for one and two months after application. the hematocrit values showed a significant increase in the group that received the mixture of b. subtilis and l. acidophilus compared with the control group. the nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt) assay, neutrophil adherence and lysozyme activity, showed a significant increase in all the probiotic-treated groups after 1 and 2 months of feeding, when compared with the untreated control group. the serum bactericidal activity was high in the group that was given a mixture of the two bacteria. the relative level of protection (rlp) was significantly higher against a. hydrophila, in the bacterial mixture treated group and against p. fluorescens in the l. acidophilus treated group, after one month of the feeding trial. a significantly higher rlp, against a. hydrophila or p. fluorescens, was noticed after 2 months of the feeding trial in the group given a mixture of the two bacteria, and against strept. iniae in the group fed a diet containing l. acidophilus.
influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of self-etching adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria.
objectives: the incorporation of antibacterial agents into adhesive systems has been proposed to eliminate residual bacteria from dentine. this study used the agar diffusion method to evaluate the antibacterial activity of clearfil protect bond (cpb), clearfil se bond (cseb), clearfil tri-s bond (c3sb) and xeno-iii (xiii) self-etching adhesive systems, with or without light-activation, against cariogenic bacteria, and to assess the influence of human dentine on the antibacterial activity of these materials. methods: an aliquot of 10 microl per material (and individual components) were pipetted onto paper and dentine discs distributed in petri dishes containing bacterial culture in bhi agar. positive control was 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx). results: after incubation, the adhesive components of cpb and cseb, liquid a of xiii and c3sb did not present antibacterial activity when applied to paper discs. the non-light-activated cpb primer+adhesive promoted the greatest inhibition of streptococcus mutans (p<0.05), whereas with light-activation, there was no significant difference between primer+adhesive and primer alone. for lactobacillus acidophilus, cpb primer presented the greatest antibacterial activity in both light-activation conditions (p<0.05). regarding the dentine discs, only chx promoted an inhibitory effect, though less intense than on paper discs (p<0.05). chx presented greater antibacterial activity against s. mutans than against l. acidophilus (p<0.05). conclusions: light-activation significantly reduced the antibacterial activity of the self-etching adhesive systems; mdpb incorporation contributed to the effect of adhesive systems against cariogenic bacteria; the components eluted from the adhesive systems were not capable to diffuse through 400 microm-thick dentine disc to exert their antibacterial activity against cariogenic bacteria.
in vitro evaluation of antibacterial activity of an herbal dentifrice against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus.
antibacterial activity of a herbal dentifrice arodent against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus was evaluated using colgate as standard. both bacterial strains were isolated from the oral cavity on selective media and identified by standard methods. the antibacterial activity was assayed by cup-well method. the bacterial lawn of facultative anaerobe s. mutans was established between two layers of agar under microaerophilic conditions. five and a half millimeters and 10 mm zones of inhibition were produced by arodent against s. mutans and l. acidophilus , respectively, under microaerophilic conditions. on the other hand, the standard dentifrice colgate produced 5.83 mm and 10.17 mm zones of inhibition against s. mutans and l. acidophilus , respectively, under microaerophilic condition. the results suggest that arodent is an effective antibacterial herbal dentifrice.
long-term antibacterial effects and physical properties of a chlorhexidine-containing glass ionomer cement.
statement of the problem: many regions in the world do not have electricity, water, or access to dental facilities that allows the treatment of caries with dental handpieces and rotary burs. for restorative techniques used in these regions, an antibacterial self-adherent glass ionomer material would contribute considerably. purpose: this study aimed to test if chlorhexidine diacetate (fluka biochemika, buchs, switzerland)- or chlorhexidine digluconate (sigma-aldrich, steinheim, germany)-added chemfil superior glass ionomer cement (dentsply detrey, konstanz, germany) had any long-term antibacterial effect against certain oral bacteria and to test the new formulation's physical properties. materials and methods: chemfil superior was used as a control. chlorhexidine diacetate (powder) was added to the powder and chlorhexidine digluconate (liquid) was mixed with the powder in order to obtain 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5% concentrations of the respective groups. setting time, compressive strength, and acid erosion were tested according to iso 9917-1. working time, hardness, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength were also determined. long-term antimicrobial activity against s. mutans, l. acidophilus, and c. albicans were tested with the agar diffusion method. analysis of variance (anova) was used for comparison (p < 0.05). results: regarding the immediate antibacterial effect for s. mutans, all the tested groups showed inhibitions of the strain compared with the control group (p < 0.05), with larger zones for the higher concentration groups and all the diacetates. for l. acidophilus, all the groups were effective compared with the control, but the greatest antibacterial effect was observed with the 2.5% diacetate group. the 2.5% group of chlorhexidine diacetate showed antibacterial activity up to 90 days against s. mutans and up to 60 days against l. acidophilus. the working and setting time, acid erosion test, diametral tensile strength, and biaxial flexural strength of the tested groups were not different from the control chemfil group. however, the 1.25 and 2.5% groups of chlorhexidine diacetate had significantly lower compressive strengths than the control group. lower hardness values were obtained with the 0.5 and 2.5% chlorhexidine digluconate groups in comparison with the control group. clinical significance: the results of this in vitro investigation demonstrated that chlorhexidine diacetate or digluconate added to the chemfil superior glass ionomer material can exhibit long-term antibacterial effects against s. mutans and l. acidophilus without compromising the physical properties of the material.
probiotic crescenza cheese containing lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
high-pressure homogenization (hph) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. to evaluate the potential of milk treated by hph for the production of crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: hph (from hph-treated milk), p (from pasteurized milk), hph-p (hph-treated milk plus probiotics), and p-p (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. a strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees c). according to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and ph. differently, the hph treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. in fact, after 12 d of storage, the lactobacillus paracasei a13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus h5 exhibited, in p-p cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the hph-p cheese. the hyperbaric treatment had a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. no significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among hph and p cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among hph, hph-p, and p-p crescenza cheeses.
effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
purpose: to evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by sonicare advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. methods: a wild strain of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius and veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. for each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. the distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. a colorimetric technique (mtt assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. results: anova results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of s. mutans and s. salivarius adherent to the disks, while l. acidophilus and v. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. in the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while s. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, s. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to sonicare.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria in vitro.
background: cecropin-xj belongs to cecropin-b, which is the most potent antibacterial peptide found naturally. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria. methods: four oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii) were chosen for this experiment. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and reductive percent of bacterial growth were used to assay the antibacterial activity of cecropin-xj. mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj was tested with human periodontal membrane fibroblasts by tetrazolium (mtt) colorimetric assay. the bacterial morphological changes induced by cecropin-xj were examined on scanning electron microscope (sem). the influence of cecropin-xj on bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) was measured by scintillation counting. results: the mics of cecropin-xj for inhibition of the growth of four bacteria ranged from 4.0 to 42.8 micromol/l with the highest susceptible to a. naeslundii and the lowest susceptible to l. acidophilus. at ph 6.8, 5.5 and 8.2, 1/2 mic of cecropin-xj reduced the number of viable bacteria by 40.9%, 67.8% and 32.8% for s. mutans and by 28.1%, 57.2% and 37.9% for l. acidophilus. the activities against s. mutans and l. acidophilus increased at ph 5.5 compared with ph 6.8 (p < 0.01, respectively). in present of 50% saliva, 1/2 mic of the peptide decreased the direct count of viable cells by 29.2% and 14.4% for s. mutans and l. acidophilus, respectively (p < 0.01 and p > 0.05, respectively), whereas almost no reduction counts were detected in the presence of 20% serum for both bacteria (p > 0.05, respectively). mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj from 1.0 to 100 micromol/l exhibited no cytotoxicity against human periodontal membrane fibroblasts (p > 0.05). bacterial morphological changes induced by mic of cecropin-xj examined on sem showed cell surface disruption. furthermore, the ability of a. naeslundii adhesion to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 10 and 20 minutes (p = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), and s. mutans, a. viscosus to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 20 minutes (p = 0.000, respectively). conclusions: cecropin-xj exhibited bactericidal action against cariogenic pathogens, and the antibacterial activity enhanced in the acid environment. the results also demonstrate that cecropin-xj prevents s. mutans and actinomyces adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that cecropin-xj may have potential to prevent caries.
inhibition of nonproteolytic clostridium botulinum with lactic acid bacteria and  their bacteriocins at refrigeration temperatures.
nonproteolytic clostridium botulinum (strains 17b, beluga, and 202f) was found to be inhibited by lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pediococcus species in tests by the spot-on-the-lawn simultaneous-antagonism method at 10, 15, and 25 degrees c. c. botulinum 17b was the most resistant strain. inhibition zone size increased with decreasing incubation temperature. six strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and seven strains of bifidobacteria failed to produce an inhibition zone on buffered reinforced clostridium prussian blue agar seeded with spores of any of the selected c. botulinum strains. c. botulinum 17b was sensitive to 50 to 100 iu of nisin per ml and to 10 to 20 au of pediocin a per ml.
antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis) for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3 +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.
viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.
isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
effects of various resin composite (co)monomers and extracts on two caries-associated micro-organisms in vitro.
previous studies have shown that extracts of various filling materials, e.g., resin composites, may influence the growth of cariogenic micro-organisms. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of important resin composite (co)monomers (bis-gma, udma, tegdma, egdma) and extracts of two commercial dental composites with similar composition (composite a, arabesk; composite s, superlux) on the growth of the two cariogenic bacterial pathogens streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus acidophilus. it was found that neither the monomers bis-gma and udma, nor the comonomer egdma, nor the extract of composite a influenced the growth of s. sobrinus in the log phase. the comonomer tegdma and the extract of composite s were found to stimulate growth in the log phase, but this stimulation was not statistically significant. however, egdma, tegdma, and the extract of composite s did stimulate the total growth of s. sobrinus. in the assays with l. acidophilus, bis-gma, udma, and the extract of composite a inhibited the growth in the log phase, whereas tegdma stimulated it. furthermore, egdma, tegdma, and the extract of composite s stimulated the biomass production of l. acidophilus. we conclude from our results that a release of egdma and tegdma from resin composites should be avoided due to their growth-stimulating effects on the caries-associated micro-organisms s. sobrinus and l. acidophilus.
lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.
role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
effect of milks inoculated with lactobacillus acidophilus or a yogurt starter culture in lactose-maldigesting children.
dairy products containing live bacteria that possess lactase activity are used for dietary management of lactose maldigestion. the efficacy of acidophilus milk and the effect of consuming unfermented milk that had been inoculated with yogurt bacteria have not been examined in children. we compared scores for breath h2 excretion and symptoms of 20 lactose-maldigesting children following ingestion of 250 ml of uninoculated milk with two identical milks inoculated with 10(10) cells of lactobacillus acidophilus or with a commercial yogurt starter culture containing 10(8) cells of lactobacillus lactis and 10(10) cells of streptococcus thermophilus. nine of 10 subjects who were symptomatic following ingestion of uninoculated milk experienced a reduction in symptoms following ingestion of milk inoculated with l. acidophilus, without a decline in h2 excretion. five of 6 subjects who were symptomatic following uninoculated milk had decreased symptoms and a significant reduction in h2 excretion following milk inoculated with the yogurt culture. for lactose-maldigesting children, milks inoculated with l. acidophilus or with a yogurt culture were associated with decreased symptoms compared with those with uninoculated milk.
in vitro effects of a thiopeptide and monensin on ruminal fermentation of soluble carbohydrates.
using a purified diet and a mixed culture of ruminal microorganisms, we studied the in vitro effects of a sulfur-containing peptide (a10255) and monensin on ruminal vfa and lactic acid concentrations. after 22 h of fermentation, total vfa concentration was greater in cultures with a10255 and monensin (2.5 ppm each) than in untreated controls (84.1, 91.9, and 65.2 mm for cultures with a10255, monensin, and control, respectively). the molar proportions of propionate were more than 40% greater, and the molar proportions of acetate were about 15% less, in treated than in untreated cultures. the molar proportions of the remaining vfa were lowest in monensin-treated cultures, intermediate in a10255-treated cultures, and greatest in untreated cultures. addition of a10255 or monensin also prevented the accumulation of lactate and maintained higher ph than in untreated cultures. in pure culture, growth of streptococcus bovis was slowed by a10255 at ph 5.5 and 6.5. growth of s. bovis was reduced markedly with addition of monensin at ph 6.5 and inhibited at ph 5.5. growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited more at ph 5.5 than 6.5 with monensin but was unaffected by a10255. the thiopeptide a10255 and monensin inhibited ruminal lactate production, but sensitivities of lactate-producing bacteria differed between compounds.
antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine.
the antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus, and bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 as an indicator bacterium. each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine. the milk cultured with lactobacillus acidophilus la 106 (la2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by lb. acidophilus la 106 (la2) during incubation were also examined using n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.
influence of bacteria on clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
when monoflora chickens with lactobacillus acidophilus or streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of c. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. c. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/g after inoculation 10(8) cfu broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. when c. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, c. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. these findings indicate that the pathogenicity of c. perfringens was suppressed by l. acidophilus or s. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.
conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded determinants for bacteriocin production and  immunity in lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid determinants in laf and laf.
effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
detection and activity of lactacin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
a total of 52 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for production of bacteriocins. a majority (63%) demonstrated inhibitory activity against all members of a four-species grouping of lactobacillus leichmannii, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus lactis. four l. acidophilus strains with this activity also inhibited streptococcus faecalis and lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting a second system of antagonism. under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, no inhibition of other gram-positive or -negative genera was demonstrated by l. acidophilus. the agent produced by l. acidophilus n2 and responsible for inhibition of l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, and l. lactis was investigated. ultrafiltration studies indicated a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 for the crude inhibitor. the agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c (ph 5). activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. these characteristics identified the inhibitory agent as a bacteriocin, designated lactacin b. examination of strains of l. acidophilus within the six homology groupings of johnson et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin b could not be used in classification of neotype l. acidophilus strains. however, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin b in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.
influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
1. the gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. in 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli exceeded those of control chicks. 3. high counts of proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. in vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. 4. the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. the protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to l. salivarius. 5. the ph was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. of the strains used in gnotobiotic experiments e. coli, s. faecalis and l. salivarius produced the lowest ph values in the caeca.
effects of eimeria brunetti on intestinal ph in conventional and gnotobiotic chickens.
white leghorn cockerels, 2-4 weeks of age, inoculated with sporulated oocysts of  eimeria brunetti had a lower mean ph in the middle and lower small intestine than did uninoculated controls by 5-9 days post-inoculation. no effect of the infection on ph was seen in the upper intestine while ph in the gizzard and caeca was occasionally higher than in controls. magnitude of ph. decrease did not correlate with increases in oocyst dosage and severity of infection as measured by lesion score. studies with germ-free (gf) and gnotobiotic chicks showed that host bacterial flora was essential for a ph decrease in the middle and lower small intestine with e. brunetti infection. inoculation of gf birds with lactobacillus acidophilus or l. acidophilus plus streptococcus faecalis, in addition to e. brunetti resulted in some decrease in ph.
mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
nicotinamide deamidation by microorganisms in rat stomach.
we have extended our investigation of nicotinamide deamidation in the stomach of  conventional rats. the bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as flavobacterium peregrinum, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. nicotinamide-7-(14)c ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. these results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.
