TI  == pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. there were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative).  the bacteria were peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), bacteroides fragilis (3), clostridium sp (2), fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), prevotella sp (1), bateroides sp (1), streptococcus pyogenes (1), and escherichia coli (1). recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. this study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in  children with pyomyositis.

TI  == intrauterine bacterial findings and hormonal profiles in post-partum cows with normal puerperium.
AB  == the post-partum intrauterine bacterial flora, prostaglandin release, uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity were studied in 9 swedish dairy cows during the first 8-week period. uterine involution was monitored by transrectal examinations of the reproductive tract 3 times weekly. bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. the main pgf2 alpha metabolite (15-ketodihydro-pgf2 alpha) was monitored from twice daily blood plasma samples, while morning samples were used for progesterone determinations. the cows were assigned to 2 groups: group i (n = 7) with an uncomplicated puerperal period and group ii (n = 2) with signs of intrauterine infections. a total of 143 biopsies were collected, of which 129 (90.2%) were found to be bacteriologically negative. thirteen (9.1%) of the remaining 14 biopsies were bacteriologically positive, while one (0.7%) was probably a contamination on a single occasion. the 13 bacteriologically positive biopsies belonged to the group ii cows from which 31 isolates contained 6 different genera of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. actinomyces pyogenes along with bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium necrophorum were found to predominate in a mixed flora. the bacteria were rapidly eliminated and disappeared completely from the uteri towards the end of the third week post-partum. the average number of days required for completion of uterine involution was 21.8 +/- 3.0 for all animals. the plasma levels of the pgf2 alpha metabolite were significantly elevated for the first 12-18, and 18 and 27 days in group i and group ii, respectively. there was no significant relationship between the duration of pgf2  alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution (p > 0.05). progesterone analysis showed resumption of ovarian activity and subsequent ovulation in 4 of the 9 cows 44-55 days post-partum. thus, intrauterine infections are not commonly seen in cows with normal calving and comparison between the duration of pgf2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution showed insignificant correlation. however, the longer duration of pgf2 alpha release recorded in the 2 cows with intrauterine infections are related to the increased frequency of infections.

TI  == otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  == otitis media (om) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. a knowledge of the pathogens responsible for om can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. the microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic om is reviewed. the major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute om and half of serous om cultures are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute om. the predominant organisms isolated from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp, bacteroides sp, and fusobacterium sp. many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. the appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == studies on the possible role of cattle nuisance flies, especially hydrotaea irritans, in the transmission of summer mastitis in denmark.
AB  == the summer mastitis pathogens actinomyces pyogenes, peptococcus indolicus, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii, fusobacterium necrophorum and streptococcus dysgalactiae were isolated from the polyphagous symbovine dipterans hydrotaea irritans (fallen) and morellia sp. caught around dairy heifers on pasture, but not from the haematophagous species haematobia irritans (l.), haematobosca stimulans (meigen), culicoides sp. and simulium sp. secretions from  clinical cases of summer mastitis proved to be sources of summer mastitis bacteria for more than 3 weeks despite antibiotic treatment and teat amputation.  taking into account the seasonal activity pattern of hydrotaea irritans and its topographical distribution on grazing cattle, it appears evident that this fly may play a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the bacterial contamination with summer mastitis pathogens on the teats of healthy cattle. in the present study the survival of a.pyogenes and p.indolicus for 7 days in experimentally infected hydrotaea irritans, as demonstrated by the recovery of these microorganisms from agar plates exposed to live infected flies, is described. however, experimental transmission of summer mastitis from sick to healthy heifers by hydrotaea irritans proved unsuccessful.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  == thirty-four aspirates of pus from peritonsillar abscesses that were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria showed bacterial growth. a total 107 bacterial isolates (58 anaerobic and 49 aerobic and facultative) were recovered, accounting for 3.1 isolates per specimen (1.7 anaerobic and 1.4 aerobic and facultatives). anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (18%) patients, aerobic and facultatives in 2 (6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 26 (76%). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 4 infections, 2 of which were streptococcus  pyogenes and 2 were anaerobic bacteria. the predominant bacterial isolates were staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), bacteroides sp (21 isolates, including 15 bacteroides melaninogenicus group), and peptostreptococcus sp (16) and s. pyogenes (10). beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 13 (52%) of 25 specimens tested. this retrospective study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in peritonsillar abscess.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == fusobacterium necrophorum and actinomyces pyogenes associated facial and mandibular abscesses in blue duiker.
AB  == anaerobic and aerobic cultures of facial and mandibular abscesses were made from  12 blue duiker (cephalophus monticola fusicolor) housed at the deer and duiker research facility of the pennsylvania state university (usa). increases in concentrations of total protein and serum globulin occurred in all cases. actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from nine animals. fusobacterium necrophorum was present in eight and bacteroides sp. was found in seven animals; other genera of isolated bacteria included: streptococcus (from two animals), lactobacillus (one), staphylococcus (one) and actinomyces (two). eight (67%) of affected animals were less than or equal to 2 yr of age. facial soft tissues and mandibles were the tissues most often affected. tissues within the oral cavity were not affected at the time of presentation. a common finding, not reported in other host species with necrobacillosis, was the presence of nondestructive mandibular  proliferation.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

TI  == in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (sc-47111; ny-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. the mics of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. ninety percent of neisseria sp. and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. there was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. the protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. however, urine at ph 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at ph 7.0

TI  == comparison of the microbiology of group a and non-group a streptococcal tonsillitis.
AB  == we studied the microbial flora of tonsils removed from 20 children who suffered from recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) tonsillitis and 20 who had tonsillar hypertrophy following recurrent non-gabhs tonsillitis. similar  polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora were recovered from the cores of the tonsils in each group. beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were recovered more often in the group with gabhs. this difference was due mostly to the lower incidence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of branhamella catarrhalis and bacteroides sp in hypertrophic tonsils following non-gabhs tonsillitis. beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus was found with equal frequency in  both groups. these findings demonstrate that although blpb are recovered more often in recurrently inflamed tonsils following gabhs infection, blpb also can be found in hypertrophic tonsils following non-gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == peritonsillar infection in christchurch 1981-1984.
AB  == retrospective review of the notes of 83 peritonsillar infection sufferers over three years at christchurch hospital reveals that the typical sufferer is a young adult male who is most likely to present in winter or summer. only a quarter of the patients had a significant recent history of tonsillitis but four had had a previous quinsy and six had had a previous tonsillectomy in childhood. length of  symptoms does not appear helpful in differentiating an abscess from a cellulitis. anaerobic organisms were found in 49% of aspirates and streptococci were the most important aerobic organism. potential beta lactamase producing organisms, h influenzae, staph aureus and bacteroides sp were infrequent and penicillin remains the drug of choice. appropriate antibiotics and drainage are the essentials of management and tonsillectomy may be indicated.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == the frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  == the prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. the study involved 147 friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. all herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. no anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. only anaerobes were present in  10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. a variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. peptococcus spp. was associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and bacteroides spp. with staphylococcus aureus and/or streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-g but all the gram negative rods were resistant. in addition, all b. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. the ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain  of peptococcus indolicus and a peptostreptococcus sp.

TI  == the treatment of the carrier state of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  == 20 children who were chronic carriers of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) were treated with oral clindamycin. surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. they were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. prior to therapy, the average yield was 9  isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). gabhs, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus and fusobacterium sp. was reduced. beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). these included all isolates of s. aureus (8) and b. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 b. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 b. oralis (60%). only  one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of b. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of gabhs in 19 of the 20 children.
