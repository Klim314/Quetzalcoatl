TI  == improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the bifidobacterium catenulatum pbc1 replicon.
AB  == this study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pbc1, a cryptic plasmid from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. these vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in lactococcus lactis or lactobacillus casei. they showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good  segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the laczalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in escherichia coli. the functionality of the vectors for engineering bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to bifidobacterium longum. e. coli and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.

TI  == two families of rep-like genes that probably originated by interspecies recombination are represented in viral, plasmid, bacterial, and parasitic protozoan genomes.
AB  == two families of genes related to, and including, rolling circle replication initiator protein (rep) genes were defined by sequence similarity and by evidence of intergene family recombination. the rep genes of circoviruses were the best characterized members of the "recrep1 family." other members of the recrep1 family were rep-like genes found in the genomes of the canarypox virus, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia duodenalis and in a plasmid, p4m, from the gram-positive bacterium, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the "recrep2 family" comprised some previously identified rep-like genes from plasmids of phytoplasmas and similar rep-like genes from the genomes of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactococcus lactis, and phytoplasma asteris. both recrep1 and recrep2 proteins have a nucleotide-binding domain significantly similar to the helicases (2c proteins) of picorna-like viruses. on the n-terminal side of the nucleotide binding domain, recrep1 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one found in nanovirus reps, whereas recrep2 proteins have a domain significantly similar to one in the  reps of pls1 plasmids. we speculate that recrep genes have been transferred from  viruses or plasmids to parasitic protozoan and bacterial genomes and that rep proteins were themselves involved in the original recombination events that generated the ancestral recrep genes.
