TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  == objectives: retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. methods: the in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. mics were determined by the clsi reference agar  dilution method (m11-a6). results: ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the bacteroides fragilis group. despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the b. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/l or less. all the investigated strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/l retapamulin. three strains of c. difficile and one strain of c. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/l. conclusions: at <or=2 mg/l, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. the  broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == [the influence of amps from hacat keratinocytes on some bacteria strains derived  from skin changes].
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial activity of protein extracts  from hacat cell line against bacterial strains, isolated from clinical materials, obtained from patients with clinical symptoms of acne (propionibacterium acnes) and gas gangrene (clostridium perfringens and sterptococcus pyogenes). reference  strain of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 also was used. protein extracts from cultured hacat cells were obtained by 3-fold freezing/defreezing cells in dry ice following by centrifugation and incubated with appropriate bacterial suspension (0.5 mcfarland scale) during 6 and 24 hours. we observed time-depending and strain-depending activity of hacat--protein extract. interestingly, high activity was demonstrated against strains of s. pyogenes and c. perfringens. because of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics further studies in the field of antimicrobial peptides are required.

TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == daptomycin has in vitro activity against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, although limited numbers of species have been tested. we studied the in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against more than 100 strains each of clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes. daptomycin etest mics and results from time-kill studies were determined for selected strains. for 392 of 421 strains (93%), daptomycin was inhibitory at < or =1 microg/ml, including 15 of 16 strains of c. difficile with elevated linezolid mics of 8 and 16 microg/ml, all 32 strains with moxifloxacin mics of > or =4 microg/ml, and all 16 strains resistant to clindamycin. daptomycin mics were also < or =1 microg/ml for all 16 f. magna strains resistant to clindamycin and all 32 strains resistant to tetracycline. only one strain, a c. perfringens strain, had a mic of >2 microg/ml to daptomycin. eighty-five and 92.5% of the etest mics were within 1 dilution of the agar dilution method for all drugs at 24 and 48 h, respectively. in time-kill studies, a c. difficile strain was inhibited by both daptomycin and vancomycin at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h; colony counts were decreased by 2.3 to 2.9 log at 24 h. vancomycin was not bactericidal for c. perfringens; however, daptomycin showed bactericidal activity as early as 1 h at four and eight times the mic and at 2 and 4 h at two and four times the mic.

TI  == in vitro activity of oritavancin (ly333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against clostridium perfringens, propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of gram-positive anaerobes. mic(90)s (microg/ml) for oritavancin were as follows: clostridium perfringens 1.0, propionibacterium acnes 0.25, peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, finegoldia magna 0.25, micromonas. micros 0.25, and anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. on a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. the oritavancin mics are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing gram-positive anaerobes such as  these.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in new zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  == objectives: routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. this study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in new zealand. methods: clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. susceptibility was determined using nccls criteria. the change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the mic. results: a total of 364 anaerobes were tested. penicillin had poor activity against bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., eubacterium spp., clostridium tertium and veillonella spp. in general, fusobacterium spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with bacteroides fragilis group and p. anaerobius isolates. cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-b. fragilis species, eubacterium spp. and p. anaerobius. meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. with the exception of propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. there has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. conclusions: metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. no clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == inactivation of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in red cell concentrates using inactine pen110 chemistry.
AB  == background and objectives: the risk of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections as a result of the presence of bacteria in blood is one of the major concerns in transfusion medicine. the purpose of this study was to investigate whether bacteria inoculated into red blood cell concentrates can be inactivated by the inactine pen110 pathogen-reduction process. four bacterial species were chosen for the study: anaerobic gram-positive clostridium perfringens and propionibacterium acnes, known to be transfusion-transmitted; and two gram-negative species, acinetobacter johnsonii and acinetobacter lwoffii, recently reported to be a common cause of transfusion-associated infections in europe. materials and methods: identical units of leucoreduced red cell concentrates were inoculated with a. johnsonii, a. lwoffii, c. perfringens, or p. acnes. the 4 degrees c control units were put on storage immediately after receiving the spike. the test units were subjected to pen110 treatment and then stored. the bacterial titre in all units was monitored during a 6-week storage period. results: the pen110 inactivation of all tested bacterial strains was time- and titre-dependent. for a. johnsonii and a. lwoffii, no viable bacteria were detected in the units spiked with up to 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml  and treated with pen110. for red cell units spiked with 10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml of c.  perfringens and p. acnes, no viable bacteria were detected in the units treated with pen110. in control units, there was a gradual decrease in a. johnsonii, a. lwoffii and c. perfringens titres during cold storage, while p. acnes titres remained stable. conclusions: the pen110 pathogen-reduction process was demonstrated to inactivate high titres of a. johnsonii, a. lwoffii, c. perfringens and p. acnes in red cell concentrates.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  == classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. solid phase cytometry (spc) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a  membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained  only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. however, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling  of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. we have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium bifermentans, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas canoris, p. gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (c. butyricum, c. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. however, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of c. sordellii, c. sporogenes, c. tyrobutyricum. for vegetative cells of all strains, plots of spc versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that spc consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.

TI  == meningitis and shunt infection caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology and management of meningitis and shunt infections caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. the predominant anaerobes recovered in meningitis are bacteriodes spp., bacteriodes fragilis, fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. peptostreptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, propionibacterium acnes, and eubacterium are less commonly isolated. the predisposing conditions for meningitis are acute or chronic middle-ear infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and pulmonary infections. in newborn and preterm infants  the predisposing conditions are rupture of membranes, amnionitis, fetal distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastric perforation and subsequent ileus followed by bacteremia, aspiration pneumonitis and septicemia, infected ventriculoperitoneal  or ventriculoatrial shunt, and complicating dermal sinus tract infections. shunt  infection with propionibacterium spp. has been reported in children, especially in association with ventriculoauricular and ventriculoperitoneal shunts. clostridium perfringens has been recovered from infants with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. multiple-organism meningitis was reported as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts that perforated the gastrointestinal tract. early recognition and effective therapy are essential to recovery. management of meningitis includes the use of antimicrobials effective against anaerobes that penetrate the blood-brain barrier. these include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, and carbapenems. the treatment of shunt infection includes antimicrobial therapy and removal of the shunt.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == [bacteremia in intra-arterial angiography, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty  and percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage].
AB  == purpose: prospective evaluation of the rate of bacteremia attributed to invasive  radiological techniques. methods: aerobic and anerobic blood cultures were obtained in 100 patients (62 men, 38 women; mean age 65 +/- 14 years) undergoing  intra-arterial angiography (n = 50), pta (n = 30) or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (ptcd; n = 20). samples were taken before the treatment (t0), immediately after puncture of the vessel or bile duct (t2), and 30 min after the  termination of the procedure (t3). results: the overall rate of bacteremia was 18%. during diagnostic angiography a 16% rate of temporary bacteremia (no positive t3 samples) was observed. during pta the rate was 27% (no clinically significant infectious disease) and during ptcd the rate was 10% (5% cholangitis  with septicemia). we isolated staphylococci (s. epidermidis: n = 7, s. species: n = 3, s. aureus: n = 1), streptococci (n = 2), propionibacterium acnes (n = 5), e. coli (n = 1), enterococcus faecium (n = 1), enterobacter species (n = 1), and clostridium perfringens (n = 1). apart from the one patient with cholangitis no clinical infectious complication occurred. conclusion: temporary bacteremia is rather frequent during invasive radiological procedures. strictly aseptic conditions and antibiotic prophylaxis, specially in case of implantation of a permanent foreign body, is warranted.

TI  == microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  == possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. in the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. to  date, various bacterial species have been reported, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and clostridium perfringens. infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. the purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). a total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between february of 1993 and july of 1994 at the ucla medical center. the implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and dacron (6 percent). the implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by  staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then escherichia coli (1.5 percent). no fungal infections were identified. culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. the frequency (47 percent) and types (p. acnes and s. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.

TI  == nosocomial infections of ocular conjunctiva in newborns delivered by cesarian section.
AB  == colonization of the ocular conjunctiva in newborns delivered by cesarian section  occurs usually within the first day of life. we have studied the flora of the ocular conjunctiva at birth, from 19 newborns delivered by cesarian section, coming from two different maternity hospitals. ocular conjunctiva cultures yielded the main predominant flora in both maternity hospitals considered. the most common genus of this flora are: staphylococcus, corynebacterium and propionibacterium acnes. peptostreptococcus productus, neisseria, eubacterium and clostridium perfringens are isolated occasionally. in newborns delivered by cesarian section, this flora principally acquired may be the consequence of the presence of bacteria in the ambient air, as well as differences in care provided  by the nosocomial personnel.

TI  == bacteremia due to anaerobic bacteria in newborns.
AB  == awareness of the role of anaerobic bacteria in neonatal bacteremia has increased  in recent years. the incidence of recovery of anaerobes in neonatal bacteremia varies, according to different studies, between 1.8% and 12.5%. of the 178 cases  reported in the literature, 73 were due to bacteroides species (69 were the bacteroides fragilis group), 57 clostridium species (mostly clostridium perfringens), 35 peptostreptococci, 5 propionibacterium acnes, 3 veillonella species, 3 fusobacterium species, and 2 eubacterium species. predisposing factors were perinatal maternal complications (especially premature rupture of membranes  and chorioamnionitis), prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis. organisms similar to those recovered in blood were concomitantly isolated in lung aspirates and cerebrospinal and peritoneal fluids. the overall mortality noted is 26% and is highest with b fragilis group (34%). inappropriate antimicrobial therapy was often a contributory factor for such mortality. correction of underlying pathology, surgical drainage, and the use of proper antimicrobials are critical to successful resolution of the infection. penicillin g is the drug of choice for anaerobic infection other than beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides. antimicrobials useful for therapy of beta-lactamase-producing bacteroides include clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, imipenem-cilastatin, and the combination of a penicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

AB  == numerical taxonomy's techniques were employed on twenty one anaerobic gram positive bacilli strains taking account of eighty morphologic and biochemical features. two methods of coding (weighted and non weighted) and four clustering methods (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages; weighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages; single linkage and complete linkage) were used. eight dendrograms were obtained and they showed that c. haemolyticum (strains 1, 2, 4, 7); c. subterminale (strains 8, 19); c. botulinum (strain 14) and c. sporogenes (strain 15) belong to a different group than the other strains. another group would be formed with c. perfringens (strains 3, 5, 6, 12, 16, 21) and c. paraperfringens (strains 9, 10, 11). of the remaining strains the two classified as propionibacterium acnes (strains 17, 18) have a very high degree of agreement. c. histolyticum (strain 20) adjoins at a very low level, while c. butyricum (strain 13) shows a unfixed behaviour. the dendrograms display a disposition according with classical taxonomy.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == reference data on the overall resistance patterns of anaerobic bacteria are needed since in individual clinical cases susceptibility testing is complicated by the long generation time and difficulties of test conditions. benzylpenicillin and tetracyclines are the drugs of choice against clostridium perfringens. newer  cephalosporins are also active, whereas other clostridium species have been found resistant. beta-lactam antibiotics show high activity against peptococcaceae; resistance to clindamycin should be noted, however. the good in vitro activity of tetracyclines, clindamycin and erythromycin against propionibacterium acnes could be confirmed in the systemic and local therapy of acne vulgaris. in contrast to gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, only some penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives are sufficiently active against gram-negative rods of the bacteroides group. sporadic resistance is seen to the newer tetrayclines, nitroimidazole compounds and to lincomycins. nevertheless, these substances must be considered as standard therapeutics for infections caused by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. it should be mentioned that cefoxitin may offer new therapeutic possibilities.

TI  == intrasplenic abscess: two case reports and review of the literature.
AB  == the occurrence of splenic abscess, sickle cell trait, and drug addiction is described in two patients. the coincidence of sickle cell disease and drug addiction in the possible etiology of splenic abscess should be noted. the first  patient had a splenic abscess in the inferior pole of the spleen with signs and symptoms of left upper quadrant peritoneal irritation. the second patient had an  intrasplenic abscess in the superior pole with pleuritic type chest pain and large left pleural effusion. in both cases, the upper gastrointestinal series was of aid in establishing the diagnosis. in one case, a splenic scan was helpful. clostridium perfringens were cultured from the abscess of one patient; and clostridium species, staphylococcus aureus and propionibacterium acnes were cultured from the other. both patients were successfully treated with splenectomy and drainage of the splenic bed.

TI  == [anaerobic bacteria in clinical specimens of a hospital laboratory (author's transl)].
AB  == over a 14-month period 261 clinical specimens were cultured anaerobically, this figure representing about 3% of the total specimens submitted to the microbiological laboratory. not accepted for anaerobic culture were stools, sputa, urines, vaginal and urethral swabs and swabs from superficial skin lesions. all materials were sent to the laboratory in an anaerobic transport medium and processed according to the recommendations of the american society for microbiology and the center for disease control, atlanta, georgia. not included in this figure are blood cultures and cultures from removed venous catheters. 35% of the specimens contained anaerobes. 169 anaerobic strains were isolated. 78 of  them belonged to the bacteroides fragilis group. clostridium perfringens was found in only 7 cases. 14% of the strains were b. melaninogenicus, 7% other gram-negative non-sporeforming rods. in most of the cases a mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora was found. more than 75% of specimens obtained from infections originating from the lower intestinal tract yielded growth of anaerobes. in infections of the bile duct anaerobes were found in 25% of the cases. in infections of the upper urinary tract anaerobes played no major role. 35% of the isolates of the b. fragilis group were resistant to tetracycline, 17%  to cefoxitin and 9% to clindamycin.

TI  == low trimethoprim susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria due to insensitive dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  == all the 28 bacteroides fragilis strains investigated were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 16 mug/ml) and resistant to  trimethoprim (tmp; minimal inhibitory concentration > 4 mug/ml). synergism between sulfamethoxazole and tmp was present in all strains at a ratio of 1:1. the few clostridia investigated proved more resistant to both compounds. dihydrofolate reductases from b. fragilis, c. perfringens, and some other anaerobic species were isolated. inhibition profiles with six structurally different inhibitors revealed major differences in all enzymes. for 50% inhibition, the enzyme from b. fragilis and all clostridia required concentrations of tmp which were between several hundredfold and 1,000-fold higher than those required for the enzyme of escherichia coli, whereas the enzyme from propionibacterium acnes only needed a threefold higher concentration. in vitro activities of tmp were seen to correspond to the activity at the enzymatic  level in b. fragilis and p. acnes, but correspond to a much lesser extent to the  activity at the enzymatic level in clostridia, where a poor penetration is assumed to be involved. dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors other than tmp were found to be as active as tmp both at the enzyme and in vitro. in b. fragilis, higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine were required for increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of tmp than in e. coli and probably also in c. perfringens.

TI  == in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  == the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c.  fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic  of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to  4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were  not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.

TI  == synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by staphylococcus aureus or clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of propionibacterium acnes. p. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase c-precipitated egg yolk agar. such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. similar reactions were attempted with lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. the synergistic reactions, between p. acnes and c. perfringens, were compared with the classical  camp reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. synergistic reactions observed do seem  to reflect the membrane composition. such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria,  may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.

TI  == effect of silver nitrate application on the conjunctival flora of the newborn: and the occurrence of clostridial conjunctivitis.
AB  == newborn conjunctival cultures were obtained from 35 babies prior to silver nitrate application and 48 hours later. on initial culture, 46 facultative bacteria and 27 anaerobes were recovered; 48 facultative and 18 anaerobes were recovered after 48 hours. haemophilus vaginalis, bacteroides species and anaerobic cocci decreased in numbers, whereas s. epidermidis, micrococcus and propionibacterium acnes increased during this time interval. clostridial species  were isolated from two cases who developed conjunctivitis, along with peptostreptococcus in one of the cases. in vitro experiments demonstrated lack of killing of c. perfringens in silver nitrate concentrations of 0.1 percent, even after 24 hours exposure.

TI  == detection of alcohols and volatile fatty acids by head-space gas chromatography in identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a head-space gas chromatographic technique for the analysis of volatile bacterial metabolites is described. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and propionibacterium acnes, cultured in a glucose-containing peptone yeast extract medium, were studied. the head-space technique was compared with the injection of the complete liquid culture medium, and solvent extracts thereof, into the gas chromatograph. volatile fatty acids could be detected by all three methods, whereas alcohols produced by c. perfringens and p. acnes were detectable only in  the head-space chromatograms. both ffap and porapak q were used as gas chromatography stationary phase. porapak q was found more suitable than ffap for  the separation of alcohols. the head-space technique requires a minimum of preparation before the analysis and is well suited to automation.

TI  == [susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
