TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == bone and joint infections due to anaerobic bacteria: an analysis of 61 cases and  review of the literature.
AB  == the diagnosis of anaerobic bone and joint infections (bji) were underestimated before the advent of molecular identification and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). we report  61 cases of anaerobic infections based on our 4-year experience with the management of bji. a total of 75% of cases were post-surgical infections, associated with osteosynthesis devices (65%). early infections occurred in 27% of cases, delayed infections in 17.5% of cases, and late infections in 55% of cases. we recorded 36 species of 93 anaerobic strains using maldi-tof ms (91) and molecular methods (2). we identified 20 strains of propionibacterium acnes, 13 of finegoldia magna, six of peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, and six of p. harei. polymicrobial infections occurred in 50 cases. surgical treatment was performed in 93.5% of cases. the antibiotic treatments included amoxicillin (30%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (16%), metronidazole (30%), and clindamycin (26%). hyperbaric oxygen therapy was used in 17 cases (28%). the relapse rate (27%) was  associated with lower limbs localization (p = 0.001). p. acnes bji was associated with shoulder (p = 0.019), vertebra (p = 0.021), and head flap localization (p =  0.011), and none of these cases relapsed (p = 0.007). f. magna bji was associated with ankle localization (p = 0.014). anaerobic bji is typically considered as a post-surgical polymicrobial infection, and the management of this infection combines surgical and medical treatments. maldi-tof ms and molecular identification have improved diagnosis. thus, physicians should be aware of the polymicrobial nature of anaerobic bji to establish immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment during the post-surgical period until accurate microbiological results have been obtained.
