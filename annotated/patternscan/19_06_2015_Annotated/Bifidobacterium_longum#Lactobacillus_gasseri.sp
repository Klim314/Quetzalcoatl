TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB  == background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between  breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus  bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%)  and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius,  and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm-2 ingestion induces a less inflammatory cytokine profile and a potentially beneficial shift in gut microbiota in older adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
AB  == objective: this study determined whether older adults who consumed a probiotic mixture would have a greater proportion of circulating cd4+ lymphocytes, altered  cytokine production, and a shift in intestinal microbiota toward a healthier microbial community. methods: participants (70 +/- 1 years [mean +/- sem]; n = 32) consumed a probiotic (lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm2) or a placebo twice daily for 3 weeks with a 5-week washout period between intervention periods. blood and stools were collected before and after each intervention. the percentage of circulating cd4+  lymphocytes and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cell cytokine production were measured. in stools, specific bacterial targets were quantified via quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and community composition was determined via pyrosequencing. results: during the first period of the crossover the percentage  of cd4+ cells decreased with the placebo (48% +/- 3% to 31% +/- 3%, p < 0.01) but did not change with the probiotic (44% +/- 3% to 42% +/- 3%) and log-transformed  concentrations of interleukin-10 increased with the probiotic (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) but not the placebo (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2). with the probiotic versus the placebo a higher percentage of participants had an increase  in fecal bifidobacteria (48% versus 30%, p < 0.05) and lactic acid bacteria (55%  versus 43%, p < 0.05) and a decrease in escherichia coli (52% versus 27%, p < 0.05). several bacterial groups matching faeacalibactierium prausnitzii were more prevalent in stool samples with the probiotic versus placebo. conclusions: the probiotic maintained cd4+ lymphocytes and produced a less inflammatory cytokine profile possibly due to the changes in the microbial communities, which more closely resembled those reported in healthy younger populations.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == galacto-oligosaccharides have prebiotic activity in a dynamic in vitro colon model using a (13)c-labeling technique.
AB  == galacto-oligosaccharides (gos) are considered to be prebiotic, although the contribution of specific members of the microbiota to gos fermentation and the exact microbial metabolites that are produced upon gos fermentation are largely unknown. we aimed to determine this using uniformly (13)c-labeled gos. the normal (control) medium and unlabeled or (13)c-labeled gos was added to a dynamic, validated, in vitro model of the large-intestine containing an adult-type microbiota. liquid-chromatography ms was used to measure the incorporation of (13)c label into metabolites. 16s-rrna stable isotope probing coupled to a phylogenetic micro-array was used to determine label incorporation in microbial biomass. the primary members within the complex microbiota that were directly involved in gos fermentation were shown to be bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, lactobacillus gasseri, and l. salivarius, in line with the prebiotic effect of gos, although some other species incorporated (13)c label also. gos fermentation led to an increase in acetate (+49%) and lactate (+23%) compared with the control. total organic acid production was 8.50 and 7.52 mmol/g of carbohydrate fed for the gos and control experiments, respectively. at the same time, the cumulative production of putrefactive metabolites (branched-chain  fatty acids and ammonia) was reduced by 55%. cross-feeding of metabolites from primary gos fermenters to other members of the microbiota was observed. our findings support a prebiotic role for gos and its potential to act as a synbiotic in combination with certain probiotic strains.

TI  == probiotics prevent the development of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced colonic tumorigenesis through suppressed colonic mucosa cellular proliferation and increased stimulation of macrophages.
AB  == probiotics modulate immunity and inhibit colon carcinogenesis in experimental models, but these effects largely depend on the bacterial strain, and the precise mechanisms are not well understood. therefore, we studied the effect of bifidobacterium longum and/or lactobacillus gasseri on the development of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced colonic precancerous lesions and tumors in mice while delineating the possible mechanisms involved. the results suggest that dietary consumption of probiotics (b. longum and l. gasseri) resulted in a significant inhibition of dmh-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) formation in male icr mice. long-term (24 weeks) dietary consumption of probiotics resulted in a reduction of colon tumor multiplicity and the size of the tumors. administration  of b. longum and l. gasseri suppressed the rate of colonic mucosa cellular proliferation in a manner correlating with the inhibition of tumor induction by dmh. in addition, the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was significantly increased in the dmh-treated mice that were fed various doses of b. longum, but not with l. gasseri or combined probiotics (b. longum + l. gasseri).  we also found that l. gasseri significantly increased the proliferation of raw264.7 macrophage cells through an increase in s phase dna synthesis, which was related to the up-regulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) and cyclin a. taken together, these results demonstrate the in vivo chemopreventive efficacy and the immune stimulating mechanisms of dietary probiotics against dmh-induced colonic tumorigenesis.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == diversity of intestinal bifidobacteria in patients with japanese cedar pollinosis and possible influence of probiotic intervention.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the potential association between intestinal bifidobacteria and japanese cedar pollinosis (jcpsis) and possible influences of  probiotic intervention. in this study, fecal samples were the collected from 29 jcpsis patients. the qualitative and quantitative analyses of fecal bifidobacteria were conducted by quantitative real-time pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers before cedar pollen spread and after  a 10-week intervention with fermented milk prepared with lactobacillus gg and l.  gasseri tmc0356 during pollen spread. each jcpsis patient had a unique diversity  of bifidobacteria, which varied qualitatively and quantitatively in an individual-dependent manner during pollen spread. the serum ige concentration of  jcpsis patients with more than 3 detectable bifidobacterium species was significantly lower than that of patients with less than 2 detected species. the  prevalence of b. adolescentis, b. longum, and b. catenulatum increased after probiotic intervention, although the changes were not statistically significant.  these results suggest that lower diversity of intestinal bifidobacterium species  might be a pathological aspect of jcpsis. the diversity of intestinal bifidobacteria could be a prospective target for using probiotics in the management of ige-mediated allergic disorders including jcpsis.

TI  == evaluation of the passage of lactobacillus gasseri k7 and bifidobacteria from the stomach to intestines using a single reactor model.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are thought to play an important role in the digestive system and therefore have to survive the passage from stomach to intestines. recently, a novel approach to simulate the passage from stomach to intestines in a single bioreactor was developed. the advantage of this automated  one reactor system was the ability to test the influence of acid, bile salts and  pancreatin.lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a strain isolated from infant faeces with  properties making the strain interesting for cheese production. in this study, a  single reactor system was used to evaluate the survival of l. gasseri k7 and selected bifidobacteria from our collection through the stomach-intestine passage. results: initial screening for acid resistance in acidified culture media showed a low tolerance of bifidobacterium dentium for this condition indicating low survival in the passage. similar results were achieved with b. longum subsp. infantis whereas b. animalis subsp. lactis had a high survival.these initial results were confirmed in the bioreactor model of the stomach-intestine passage. b. animalis subsp. lactis had the highest survival rate (10%) attaining approximately 5 x 106 cfu ml-1 compared to the other tested  bifidobacteria strains which were reduced by a factor of up to 106. lactobacillus gasseri k7 was less resistant than b. animalis subsp. lactis but survived at cell concentrations approximately 1000 times higher than other bifidobacteria. conclusion: in this study, we were able to show that l. gasseri k7 had a high survival rate in the stomach-intestine passage. by comparing the results with a previous study in piglets we could confirm the reliability of our simulation. of  the tested bifidobacteria strains, only b. animalis subsp. lactis showed acceptable survival for a successful passage in the simulation system.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == therapeutic value of a lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum fixed bacterium combination in acute diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial, involving 169 outpatients at 9 centers, was conducted to assess the efficacy of a fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum in the therapy of acute diarrhea. in particular, this clinical trial was designed to prove equivalent therapeutic efficacy of a fixed bacterium combination versus an exhaustive investigated mono-bacterium medicinal  product. all patients, free to carry on usual daily activities, received 1 capsule 3 times a day of either a fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum or enterococcus faecium mono-bacterium. all treatments were continued for a maximum of 6 days in line with the normal course  of acute diarrhea. primary efficacy criterion was the severity and duration of diarrhea assessed by the ensemble of stool frequency as change from baseline and  stool consistency at trial day 2, 3 and 4, and time in days until normal bowel function (recovery). the median duration of diarrhea was 2.70 days versus 2.67 days (fixed bacterium combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum versus mono-bacterium enterococcus feacium). the total mean difference of  duration of diarrhea was 0.072 days. this result can be considered equivalent. however, the proportion of patients with complete recovery tended to be higher in the fixed bacterium combination group (92.6% versus 87.1%) resulting in a number  needed to treat (nnt) of 18.1. the fixed bacterium combination reduced the number of unformed stools by 80% and the mono-bacterium by 75% during the first 2 days of treatment. both treatments were well tolerated. oral therapy with a fixed combination of lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum shortens the duration and decreases the severity of acute self-limiting diarrhea in adults comparable to an effective mono-bacterium medicinal product. it therefore appears to be a useful and safe treatment for this disease.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus gasseri pa 16/8, bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3, b. bifidum mf 20/5 on common cold episodes: a double blind, randomized, controlled trial.
AB  == background & aims: the aim of this study was to investigate whether the consumption of lactobacillus gasseri pa 16/8, bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3, b.  bifidum mf 20/5 (5 x 10(7) cfu/tablet) during at least 3 months influences the severity of symptoms and the incidence and duration of the common cold. methods:  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study was performed over at least 3 months during two winter/spring periods. four hundred and seventy nine healthy adults (aged 18-67) were supplemented daily with vitamins and minerals with or without the probiotic bacteria. cellular immune parameters were  evaluated in a randomly drawn subgroup of 122 volunteers before and after 14 days of supplementation. during common cold episodes, the participants recorded symptoms daily. stool samples were collected before and after 14 days of probiotic supplementation to quantify fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria using qrt-pcr. results: the total symptom score, the duration of common cold episodes,  and days with fever during an episode were lower in the probiotic-treated group than in the control group: 79.3+/-7.4 vs. 102.5+/-12.2 points (p = 0.056), 7.0+/-0.5 vs. 8.9+/-1.0 days (p = 0.045), 0.24+/-0.1 vs. 1.0+/-0.3 days (p = 0.017). a significantly higher enhancement of cytotoxic plus t suppressor cells (cd8+) and a higher enhancement of t helper cells (cd4+) was observed in the probiotic-treated group. fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly after probiotic supplementation. conclusions: the intake of probiotic bacteria during at least 3 months significantly shortened common cold episodes by almost 2 days and reduced the severity of symptoms.

TI  == the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == literature reporting activity of probiotics in infections due to helicobacter pylori has been reviewed to assess their value in combating such infections. several in vitro studies show that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill h. pylori, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent il8 release. in vivo models demonstrate that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent h. pylori infections and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection. thirteen clinical trials have  been published. in six (180 patients), a probiotic was used alone; five of these  had an encouraging result-in three there were significantly reduced breath test readings and in two others some patients were cleared of infection. in seven further trials (682 patients), probiotics were added to a therapeutic regimen of  antibiotics, resulting in an increased cure rate in two studies, and reduced side-effects in four. trials in which fermented milk products or whole cultures of lactobacilli were used tended to show better results than when the probiotic was taken in the form of bacteria alone. not all the studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled, and some involved only small numbers of patients. the results suggest that probiotics may have a place as adjunctive treatment in h. pylori infections and possibly in prophylaxis. future trials should address in particular the type of patient (asymptomatic volunteers, symptomatic patients), choice of probiotic strain(s), a wide range of probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium longum, and bioyoghurts) have been used-some non-viable, regimens (doses and duration) and criteria of success (breath test, histology, culture, serology).

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == antimutagenicity and the influence of physical factors in binding lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum cells to amino acid pyrolysates.
AB  == antimutagenic and binding properties of 28 strains of lactobacillus gasseri and 2 strains of bifidobacterium longum on the mutagenicity of amino acid pyrolysates were investigated in vitro using a streptomycin-dependent (sd510) strain of salmonella typhimurium ta 98. four strains of l. acidophilus (sbt0274, sbt1703, sbt10239, and sbt10241) and 1 strain of b. longum (sbt 2928) exhibited the highest percentage of antimutagenicity and binding. these 5 strains were further  optimized for other physical factors influencing the mechanism of binding, such as cell and mutagen concentration, ph, and incubation time. in all of the selected strains, 2 mg of cells bound with 88 to 95% of 0.2 mg of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole in 30 min at ph 7.0. other amino acid pyrolysates, such as 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, 2-amino-6-methyldi-pyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole, 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline, and 2-amino-3,4-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline were also tested for the binding ability of these strains. we observed that the complexity of the mutagens greatly influenced the binding properties. the binding of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole to the purified cell walls was very high compared with that of the crude cell wall, peptidoglycan, or the cell extract. binding was inhibited when the cell walls were subjected to treatment with metaperiodate or trichloroacetic acid but not when they were subjected to treatment with lysozyme, trypsin, or proteinase k, reflecting the role of the carbohydrate component as a  binding site.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == delta 22-beta-muricholic acid in monoassociated rats and conventional rats.
AB  == bile acids were analyzed in the bile, small and large intestines, and feces of germ-free rats after a single inoculation with one of six intestinal bacteria that had been originally isolated from human feces. bacteroides vulgatus and bifidobacterium longum preferentially deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid and taurocholic acid, respectively. clostridium ramosum, peptostreptococcus productus and lactobacillus gasseri deconjugated both bile acids, but escherichia coli did  not deconjugate either one. rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid produced delta 22-beta-muricholic acid in the feces. in contrast, delta 22-cholic acid could not be detected in rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated taurocholic acid.
