TI  == a new shuttle plasmid that stably replicates in clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == we have developed a new shuttle plasmid, designated as plk1-mcs that can be replicated in both clostridium acetobutylicum and escherichia coli, by combining  the pub110 and puc19 plasmids. plasmid plk1-mcs was more stably replicated than previously reported plasmids containing either the pim13 or the pambeta1 replicon in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure. the transfer frequency of plk1-mcs into c. acetobutylicum was similar to the transfer frequency of other shuttle plasmids. we complemented c. acetobutylicum ml1 (that does not produce solvents such as acetone, butanol, and ethanol (abe) due to loss of the megaplasmid psol1 harboring the adhe1-ctfab-adc operon) by introducing plk1-mcs carrying the adhe1-ctfab-adc operon into c. acetobutylicum ml1. the transformed cells were able to resume anaerobic solvent production, indicating that the new shuttle plasmid has the potential for practical use in microbial biotechnology.

TI  == improved n-butanol tolerance in escherichia coli by controlling membrane related  functions.
AB  == as the increasing demand from both chemical and fuel markets, the interest in producing n-butanol using biological route has been rejuvenated to engineer an economical fermentation process, competing with the currently-dominant chemical synthesis. n-butanol has been traditionally produced from the abe fermentation of clostridium acetobutylicum. this system, however, is not economically feasible due to its limited efficiency and the lack of genetic modification tools for further improvements. alternatively, n-butanol synthesis pathway was successfully transferred into escherichia coli and rapidly improved to reach a level of production comparable to the native producer. nevertheless, the toxicity of n-butanol has become a common issue that either approach has to deal with. previously, we reported our success in improving n-butanol tolerance in e. coli by engineering an artificial transcription factor (atf) that can modify the expression level of multiple targets simultaneously and improved the n-butanol tolerance of mg1655 strain to 1.5% (vol/vol) n-butanol. however, it was observed  that some possible n-butanol tolerance mechanisms did not occurred upon the atf expression, especially the membrane-related functions such as the homeoviscous adaptation, iron uptaking system, and efflux pump system. in this work, we attempted to enhance the n-butanol tolerance associated with the atf by combining it with the membrane-related functions in e. coli, including the overexpression of fatty acid synthesis genes, iron-uptaking protein feoa, and introducing a srpabc efflux pump from pseudomonas putida into e. coli. the synergistic effect of this combinatorial approach led to 4, 5, and 9-fold improved growths in the cultures containing 1, 1.5, and 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol, respectively, of an mg1655 knockout strain engineered for n-butanol production, and expanded the tolerance limit to 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol.

TI  == comparative transcriptome analysis between csra-disruption clostridium acetobutylicum and its parent strain.
AB  == the genome of clostridium acetobutylicum contains the gene encoding csra, a carbon storage regulator. we investigated the function of csra in c. acetobutylicum by insertionally inactivating the encoding gene, ca_c2209 using the clostron. disruption of csra obviously decreases the growth of the organism and reduces the yield of acetone, butanol and ethanol (abes). like the csra in escherichia coli, rna-seq and beta-galactosidase analysis revealed that csra in c. acetobutylicum was closely involved in regulating multiple pathways including  flagella assembly, oligopeptide transporting, iron uptake, and central carbon metabolism. it has also been newly demonstrated that csra in c. acetobutylicum is related to the regulation of pathways involved in the phosphotransferase transporting systems, synthesis of riboflavin, and stage iii sporulation. this research represented the first investigation of global regulation by csra in the  strain belonging to gram-positive bacteria through transcriptome analysis and provided the important theoretical evidence for improving solvent production by transcriptor engineering in c. acetobutylicum.

TI  == metabolic engineering of an atp-neutral embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway in corynebacterium glutamicum: growth restoration by an adaptive point mutation in nadh dehydrogenase.
AB  == corynebacterium glutamicum uses the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway of glycolysis  and gains 2 mol of atp per mol of glucose by substrate-level phosphorylation (slp). to engineer glycolysis without net atp formation by slp, endogenous phosphorylating nad-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) was replaced by nonphosphorylating nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapn) from clostridium acetobutylicum, which irreversibly converts glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (gap) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-pg) without generating  atp. as shown recently (s. takeno, r. murata, r. kobayashi, s. mitsuhashi, and m. ikeda, appl environ microbiol 76:7154-7160, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.01464-10), this atp-neutral, nadph-generating glycolytic pathway did not allow for the growth of corynebacterium glutamicum with glucose as the sole carbon source unless hitherto unknown suppressor mutations occurred; however, these mutations were not disclosed. in the present study, a suppressor mutation was identified, and it was shown that heterologous expression of udha encoding soluble transhydrogenase from escherichia coli partly restored growth, suggesting that growth was inhibited by nadph accumulation. moreover, genome sequence analysis of second-site suppressor mutants that were able to grow faster with glucose revealed a single point mutation in the gene of  non-proton-pumping nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ndh-ii) leading to the amino acid change d213g, which was shared by these suppressor mutants. since related ndh-ii enzymes accepting nadph as the substrate possess asparagine or glutamine residues at this position, d213g, d213n, and d213q variants of c. glutamicum ndh-ii were constructed and were shown to oxidize nadph in addition to nadh. taking these findings together, atp-neutral glycolysis by the replacement of endogenous nad-dependent gapdh with nadp-dependent gapn became possible via oxidation of nadph formed in this pathway by mutant nadph-accepting ndh-ii(d213g) and thus by coupling to electron transport phosphorylation (etp).

TI  == a synthetic o2 -tolerant butanol pathway exploiting native fatty acid biosynthesis in escherichia coli.
AB  == several synthetic metabolic pathways for butanol synthesis have been reported in  escherichia coli by modification of the native coa-dependent pathway from selected clostridium species. these pathways are all dependent on the o2 -sensitive adhe2 enzyme from clostridium acetobutylicum that catalyzes the sequential reduction of both butyryl-coa and butyraldehyde. we constructed an o2  -tolerant butanol pathway based on the activities of an acp-thioesterase, acting  on butyryl-acp in the native fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, and a promiscuous carboxylic acid reductase. the pathway was genetically optimized by screening a series of bacterial acyl-acp thioesterases and also by modification of the physical growth parameters. in order to evaluate the potential of the pathway for butanol production, the acp-dependent butanol pathway was compared with a previously established coa-dependent pathway. the effect of (1) o2 -availability, (2) media, and (3) co-expression of aldehyde reductases was evaluated systematically demonstrating varying and contrasting functionality between the acp- and coa-dependent pathways. the yield of butanol from the acp-dependent pathway was stimulated by enhanced o2 -availability, in contrast to the coa-dependent pathway, which did not function well under aerobic conditions. similarly, whilst the coa-dependent pathway only performed well in complex media, the acp-dependent pathway was not influenced by the choice of media except in the absence of o2 . a combination of a thioesterase from bacteroides fragilis and the aldehyde reductase, ahr, from e. coli resulted in the greatest yield of butanol.  a product titer of ~300 mg/l was obtained in 24 h under optimal batch growth conditions, in most cases exceeding the performance of the reference coa-pathway  when evaluated under equivalent conditions.

TI  == engineering cellular robustness of microbes by introducing the groesl chaperonins from extremophilic bacteria.
AB  == the cellular robustness is a big concern for efficient microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals. in this study, the groesl genes from extremophilic bacteria were found to serve as transplantable stress-response elements to improve diverse types of stress-tolerances of other microbes. by overexpressing the groesl from the solvent-tolerant pseudomonas putida in escherichia coli, its  thermo-tolerance and ethanol-tolerance were significantly increased. meanwhile, the groesl from the thermophilic thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis endowed clostridium acetobutylicum with improved corn cob hydrolysates (cch)-tolerance as well as elevated butanol productivity. the chaperonins groesl have been widely considered as cellular stress-response proteins and overexpression of native groesl has been proven to improve cellular tolerances facing various stresses. here we found that the groesl genes from extremophilic bacteria were superior to  the native ones, possibly because they have adapted to the environmental stresses during long-term natural evolution. moreover, our results also revealed that different extreme groesl genes performed quite different in different microbes. thus the relation and compatibility between the extremophiles and the host must be considered for selection of the proper groesl for engineering microbial robustness.

TI  == steady-state metabolite concentrations reflect a balance between maximizing enzyme efficiency and minimizing total metabolite load.
AB  == steady-state metabolite concentrations in a microorganism typically span several  orders of magnitude. the underlying principles governing these concentrations remain poorly understood. here, we hypothesize that observed variation can be explained in terms of a compromise between factors that favor minimizing metabolite pool sizes (e.g. limited solvent capacity) and the need to effectively utilize existing enzymes. the latter requires adequate thermodynamic driving force in metabolic reactions so that forward flux substantially exceeds reverse flux. to test this hypothesis, we developed a method, metabolic tug-of-war (mtow), which computes steady-state metabolite concentrations in microorganisms on a genome-scale. mtow is shown to explain up to 55% of the observed variation in measured metabolite concentrations in e. coli and c. acetobutylicum across various growth media. our approach, based strictly on first thermodynamic principles, is the first method that successfully predicts high-throughput metabolite concentration data in bacteria across conditions.

TI  == microbial production of short-chain alkanes.
AB  == increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems  have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production  of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. here we report the development of platform escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (scas; petrol), free fatty acids (ffas), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (acp)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-coa pathway. first, the beta-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fade gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-coas generated in vivo. to increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to scas in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-acp synthase (fabh), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-acps, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadr gene; deletion of the fadr gene prevents upregulation of the faba and fabb genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. a modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-acps to the corresponding ffas, which were then converted to scas by the sequential reactions of e. coli fatty acyl-coa synthetase, clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-coa reductase and arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. the final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of scas  consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain ffas using a fadd-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the acinetobacter sp. adp1 wax ester synthase (atfa) and the e. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe(mut)).

TI  == engineering a synthetic pathway in cyanobacteria for isopropanol production directly from carbon dioxide and light.
AB  == production of alternate fuels or chemicals directly from solar energy and carbon  dioxide using engineered cyanobacteria is an attractive method to reduce petroleum dependency and minimize carbon emissions. here, we constructed a synthetic pathway composed of acetyl-coa acetyl transferase (encoded by thl), acetoacetyl-coa transferase (encoded by atoad), acetoacetate decarboxylase (encoded by adc) and secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded by adh) in synechococcus elongatus strain pcc 7942 to produce isopropanol. the enzyme-coding genes, heterogeneously originating from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 (thl  and adc), escherichia coli k-12 mg1655 (atoad) and clostridium beijerinckii (adh), were integrated into the s. elongatus genome. under the optimized production conditions, the engineered cyanobacteria produced 26.5 mg/l of isopropanol after 9 days.

TI  == engineering e. coli strain for conversion of short chain fatty acids to bioalcohols.
AB  == background: recent progress in production of various biofuel precursors and molecules, such as fatty acids, alcohols and alka(e)nes, is a significant step forward for replacing the fossil fuels with renewable fuels. a two-step process,  where fatty acids from sugars are produced in the first step and then converted to corresponding biofuel molecules in the second step, seems more viable and attractive at this stage. we have engineered an escherichia coli strain to take care of the second step for converting short chain fatty acids into corresponding alcohols by using butyrate kinase (buk), phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb) and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe2) from clostridium acetobutylicum. results:  the engineered e. coli was able to convert butyric acid and other short chain fatty acids of chain length c3 to c7 into corresponding alcohols and the efficiency of conversion varied with different e. coli strain type. glycerol proved to be a better donor of atp and electron as compared to glucose for converting butyric acid to butanol. the engineered e. coli was able to tolerate up to 100 mm butyric acid and produced butanol with the conversion rate close to  100% under anaerobic condition. deletion of native genes, such as fumarate reductase (frda) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe), responsible for side products  succinate and ethanol, which act as electron sink and could compete with butyric  acid uptake, did not improve the butanol production efficiency. indigenous acyl-coa synthetase (fadd) was found to play no role in the conversion of butyric acid to butanol. engineered e. coli was cultivated in a bioreactor under controlled condition where 60 mm butanol was produced within 24 h of cultivation. a continuous bioreactor with the provision of cell recycling allowed the continuous production of butanol at the average productivity of 7.6 mmol/l/h until 240 h. conclusions: e. coli engineered with the pathway from c. acetobutylicum could efficiently convert butyric acid to butanol. other short chain fatty acids with the chain length of c3 to c7 were also converted to the corresponding alcohols. the ability of engineered strain to convert butyric acid  to butanol continuously demonstrates commercial significance of the system.

TI  == prospective and development of butanol as an advanced biofuel.
AB  == butanol has been acknowledged as an advanced biofuel, but its production through  acetone-butanol-ethanol (abe) fermentation by clostridia is still not economically competitive, due to low butanol yield and titer. in this article, update progress in butanol production is reviewed. low price and sustainable feedstocks such as lignocellulosic residues and dedicated energy crops are needed for butanol production at large scale to save feedstock cost, but processes are more complicated, compared to those established for abe fermentation from sugar-  and starch-based feedstocks. while rational designs targeting individual genes, enzymes or pathways are effective for improving butanol yield, global and systems strategies are more reasonable for engineering strains with stress tolerance controlled by multigenes. compared to solvent-producing clostridia, engineering heterologous species such as escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae with butanol pathway might be a solution for eliminating the formation of major byproducts acetone and ethanol so that butanol yield can be improved significantly. although batch fermentation has been practiced for butanol production in industry, continuous operation is more productive for large scale production of butanol as a biofuel, but a single chemostat bioreactor cannot achieve this goal for the biphasic abe fermentation, and tanks-in-series systems  should be optimized for alternative feedstocks and new strains. moreover, energy  saving is limited for the distillation system, even total solvents in the fermentation broth are increased significantly, since solvents are distilled to ~40% by the beer stripper, and more than 95% water is removed with the stillage without phase change, even with conventional distillation systems, needless to say that advanced chemical engineering technologies can distil solvents up to ~90% with the beer stripper, and the multistage pressure columns can well balance energy consumption for solvent fraction. indeed, an increase in butanol titer with abe fermentation can significantly save energy consumption for medium sterilization and stillage treatment, since concentrated medium can be used, and  consequently total mass flow with production systems can be reduced. as for various in situ butanol removal technologies, their energy efficiency, capital investment and contamination risk to the fermentation process need to be evaluated carefully.

TI  == conversion of levulinic acid to 2-butanone by acetoacetate decarboxylase from clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == in this study, a novel system for synthesis of 2-butanone from levulinic acid (gamma-keto-acid) via an enzymatic reaction was developed. acetoacetate decarboxylase (aadc; e.c. 4.1.1.4) from clostridium acetobutylicum was selected as a biocatalyst for decarboxylation of levulinic acid. the purified recombinant  aadc from escherichia coli successfully converted levulinic acid to 2-butanone with a conversion yield of 8.4-90.3 % depending on the amount of aadc under optimum conditions (30 degrees c and ph 5.0) despite that acetoacetate, a beta-keto-acid, is a natural substrate of aadc. in order to improve the catalytic efficiency, an aadc-mediator system was tested using methyl viologen, methylene blue, azure b, zinc ion, and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as mediators. among them, methyl viologen showed the best performance, increasing the conversion yield up to 6.7-fold in comparison to that without methyl viologen. the results in this study are significant in the development of  a renewable method for the synthesis of 2-butanone from biomass-derived chemical, levulinic acid, through enzymatic decarboxylation.

AB  == butyrate pathway was constructed in recombinant escherichia coli using the genes  from clostridium acetobutylicum and treponema denticola. however, the pathway constructed from exogenous enzymes did not efficiently convert carbon flux to butyrate. three steps of the productivity enhancement were attempted in this study. first, pathway engineering to delete metabolic pathways to by-products successfully improved the butyrate production. second, synthetic scaffold protein that spatially co-localizes enzymes was introduced to improve the efficiency of the heterologous pathway enzymes, resulting in threefold improvement in butyrate  production. finally, further optimizations of inducer concentrations and ph adjustment were tried. the final titer of butyrate was 4.3 and 7.2 g/l under batch and fed-batch cultivation, respectively. this study demonstrated the importance of synthetic scaffold protein as a useful tool for optimization of heterologous butyrate pathway in e. coli.

TI  == deriving metabolic engineering strategies from genome-scale modeling with flux ratio constraints.
AB  == optimized production of bio-based fuels and chemicals from microbial cell factories is a central goal of systems metabolic engineering. to achieve this goal, a new computational method of using flux balance analysis with flux ratios  (fbratio) was further developed in this research and applied to five case studies to evaluate and design metabolic engineering strategies. the approach was implemented using publicly available genome-scale metabolic flux models. synthetic pathways were added to these models along with flux ratio constraints by fbratio to achieve increased (i) cellulose production from arabidopsis thaliana; (ii) isobutanol production from saccharomyces cerevisiae; (iii) acetone production from synechocystis sp. pcc6803; (iv) h2 production from escherichia coli mg1655; and (v) isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (ibe) production from engineered clostridium acetobutylicum. the fbratio approach was applied to each case to simulate a metabolic engineering strategy already implemented experimentally, and flux ratios were continually adjusted to find (i) the end-limit of increased production using the existing strategy, (ii) new potential strategies to increase production, and (iii) the impact of these metabolic engineering strategies on product yield and culture growth. the fbratio approach  has the potential to design "fine-tuned" metabolic engineering strategies in silico that can be implemented directly with available genomic tools.

TI  == engineering of nadph regenerators in escherichia coli for enhanced biotransformation.
AB  == efficient regeneration of nadph is one of the limiting factors that constrain the productivity of biotransformation processes. in order to increase the availability of nadph for enhanced biotransformation by engineered escherichia coli, modulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and amplification of the transhydrogenases system have been conventionally attempted as primary solutions. recently, other approaches for stimulating nadph regeneration during glycolysis,  such as replacement of native glyceradehdye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) with nadp-dependent gapdh from clostridium acetobutylicum and introduction of nadh kinase catalyzing direct phosphorylation of nadh to nadph from saccharomyces cerevisiae, were attempted and resulted in remarkable impacts on nadph-dependent  bioprocesses. this review summarizes several metabolic engineering approaches used for improving the nadph regenerating capacity in engineered e. coli for whole-cell-based bioprocesses and discusses the key features and progress of those attempts.

TI  == resolving cell composition through simple measurements, genome-scale modeling, and a genetic algorithm.
AB  == the biochemical composition of a cell is very complex and dynamic. it varies greatly among different organisms and environmental conditions. inclusion of proper cell composition data is critical for accurate genome-scale metabolic flux modeling using flux balance analysis (fba). however, determining cell composition experimentally is currently time-consuming and resource intensive. in this chapter, a method for predicting cell composition using a genome-scale model and  "easy to measure" culture data (e.g., glucose uptake rate, and specific growth rate) is presented. the method makes use of a genetic algorithm for nonlinear optimization of a biomass equation (a mathematical description of cell composition). as a case study, the method was used to optimize a biomass equation for escherichia coli mg1655 under multiple growth environments. the availability  of experimentally determined (13)c flux data allowed a direct comparison with fba predicted fluxes through the tca cycle. results showed dramatic improvement upon  optimization of the biomass equation. in a second case study, biomass equation optimization was also applied to clostridium acetobutylicum, an organism with less available biochemical cell composition data in the literature. the method produced a biomass equation highly similar to one determined experimentally for the closely related gram-positive bacillus subtilis.

TI  == the biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  == competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. these 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the  communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. in addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol).  whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some  microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: pichia anomala, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas putida; specialists such as dunaliella salina, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus spp. and other lactic  acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs gonyostomum semen and microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as rhodotorula mucilaginosa, pantoea ananatis and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as aspergillus spp., salinibacter ruber and haloquadratum walsbyi. some microbes, such as escherichia coli, mycobacterium smegmatis and pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. we propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as synodropsis spp., polypaecilum pisce, metschnikowia orientalis, salmonella spp., and caulobacter crescentus. we show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. microbial weed species are unlikely to  emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed  biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies  needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.

TI  == pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase is coupled to light-independent hydrogen production in chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
AB  == in anaerobiosis, the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii evolves molecular hydrogen (h(2)) as one of several fermentation products. h(2) is generated mostly by the [fe-fe]-hydrogenase hyda1, which uses plant type ferredoxin petf/fdx1 (petf) as an electron donor. dark fermentation of the alga is mainly of the mixed acid type, because formate, ethanol, and acetate are generated by a pyruvate:formate lyase pathway similar to escherichia coli. however, c. reinhardtii also possesses the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase pfr1, which, like pyruvate:formate lyase and hyda1, is localized in the chloroplast. pfr1 has  long been suggested to be responsible for the low but significant h(2) accumulation in the dark because the catalytic mechanism of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase involves the reduction of ferredoxin. with the aim of proving the  biochemical feasibility of the postulated reaction, we have heterologously expressed the pfr1 gene in e. coli. purified recombinant pfr1 is able to transfer electrons from pyruvate to hyda1, using the ferredoxins petf and fdx2 as electron carriers. the high reactivity of pfr1 toward oxaloacetate indicates that in vivo, fermentation might also be coupled to an anaerobically active glyoxylate cycle. our results suggest that c. reinhardtii employs a clostridial type h(2) production pathway in the dark, especially because c. reinhardtii pfr1 was also able to allow h(2) evolution in reaction mixtures containing clostridium acetobutylicum 2[4fe-4s]-ferredoxin and [fe-fe]-hydrogenase hyda.

TI  == volatility in mrna secondary structure as a design principle for antisense.
AB  == designing effective antisense sequences is a formidable problem. a method for predicting efficacious antisense holds the potential to provide fundamental insight into this biophysical process. more practically, such an understanding increases the chance of successful antisense design as well as saving considerable time, money and labor. the secondary structure of an mrna molecule is believed to be in a constant state of flux, sampling several different suboptimal states. we hypothesized that particularly volatile regions might provide better accessibility for antisense targeting. a computational framework,  genavert was developed to evaluate this hypothesis. genavert used unafold and rnaforester to generate and compare the predicted suboptimal structures of mrna sequences. subsequent analysis revealed regions that were particularly volatile in terms of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and thus potentially superior antisense targets due to their high accessibility. several mrna sequences with known natural antisense target sites as well as artificial antisense target sites were evaluated. upon comparison, antisense sequences predicted based upon the volatility hypothesis closely matched those of the naturally occurring antisense, as well as those artificial target sites that provided efficient down-regulation. these results suggest that this strategy may provide a powerful new approach to antisense design.

TI  == site saturation mutagenesis demonstrates a central role for cysteine 298 as proton donor to the catalytic site in cahyda [fefe]-hydrogenase.
AB  == [fefe]-hydrogenases reversibly catalyse molecular hydrogen evolution by reduction of two protons. proton supply to the catalytic site (h-cluster) is essential for  enzymatic activity. cysteine 298 is a highly conserved residue in all [fefe]-hydrogenases; moreover c298 is structurally very close to the h-cluster and it is important for hydrogenase activity. here, the function of c298 in catalysis was investigated in detail by means of site saturation mutagenesis, simultaneously studying the effect of c298 replacement with all other 19 amino acids and selecting for mutants with high retained activity. we demonstrated that efficient enzymatic turnover was maintained only when c298 was replaced by aspartic acid, despite the structural diversity between the two residues. purified cahyda c298d does not show any significant structural difference in terms of secondary structure and iron incorporation, demonstrating that the mutation does not affect the overall protein fold. c298d retains the hydrogen evolution activity with a decrease of k(cat) only by 2-fold at ph 8.0 and it caused a shift of the optimum ph from 8.0 to 7.0. moreover, the oxygen inactivation rate was not affected demonstrating that the mutation does not influence o(2) diffusion to the active site or its reactivity with the h-cluster. our results clearly demonstrate that, in order to maintain the catalytic efficiency and the high turnover number typical of [fefe] hydrogenases, the highly conserved c298 can be replaced only by another ionisable residue with similar steric hindrance, giving evidence of its involvement in the catalytic function of [fefe]-hydrogenases in agreement with an essential role in proton transfer to the active site.

TI  == thiolase engineering for enhanced butanol production in clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == biosynthetic thiolases catalyze the condensation of two molecules acetyl-coa to acetoacetyl-coa and represent key enzymes for carbon-carbon bond forming metabolic pathways. an important biotechnological example of such a pathway is the clostridial n-butanol production, comprising various natural constraints that limit titer, yield, and productivity. in this study, the thiolase of clostridium  acetobutylicum, the model organism for solventogenic clostridia, was specifically engineered for reduced sensitivity towards its physiological inhibitor coenzyme a (coa-sh). a high-throughput screening assay in 96-well microtiter plates was developed employing escherichia coli as host cells for expression of a mutant thiolase gene library. screening of this library resulted in the identification of a thiolase derivative with significantly increased activity in the presence of free coa-sh. this optimized thiolase comprised three amino acid substitutions (r133g, h156n, g222v) and its gene was expressed in c. acetobutylicum atcc 824 to assess the effect of reduced coa-sh sensitivity on solvent production. in addition to a clearly delayed ethanol and acetone formation, the ethanol and butanol titers were increased by 46% and 18%, respectively, while the final acetone concentrations were similar to the vector control strain. these results demonstrate that thiolase engineering constitutes a suitable methodology applicable to improve clostridial butanol production, but other biosynthetic pathways involving thiolase-mediated carbon flux limitations might also be subjected to this new metabolic engineering approach.

AB  == isolation of clostridium mutants based on gene replacement via allelic exchange remains a major limitation for this important genus. use of a heterologous counterselection marker can facilitate the identification of the generally rare allelic exchange events. we report on the development of an inducible counterselection marker and describe its utility and broad potential in quickly and efficiently generating markerless dna deletions and integrations at any genomic locus without the need for auxotrophic mutants or the use of the mobile group ii introns. this system is based on a codon-optimized mazf toxin gene from  escherichia coli under the control of a lactose-inducible promoter from clostridium perfringens. this system is potentially applicable to almost all members of the genus clostridium due to their similarly low genomic gc content and comparable codon usage. we isolated all allelic-exchange-based gene deletions (ca_p0167, sigf, and sigk) or disruptions (ca_p0157 and sigf) we attempted and integrated a 3.6-kb heterologous dna sequence (made up of a clostridium ljungdahlii 2.1-kb formate dehydrogenase [fdh] gene plus a flp recombination target [frt]-flanked thiamphenicol resistance marker) into the clostridium acetobutylicum chromosome. furthermore, we report on the development of a plasmid system with inducible segregational instability, thus enabling efficient deployment of the flp-frt system to generate markerless deletion or integration mutants. this enabled expeditious deletion of the thiamphenicol resistance marker from the fdh integrant strain as well as the sigk deletion strain. more generally, our system can potentially be applied to other organisms with underdeveloped genetic tools.

TI  == biochemical analysis of the interactions between the proteins involved in the [fefe]-hydrogenase maturation process.
AB  == [fefe]-hydrogenases are iron-sulfur proteins characterized by a complex active site, the h-cluster, whose assembly requires three conserved maturases. hyde and  hydg are radical s-adenosylmethionine enzymes that chemically modify a h-cluster  precursor on hydf, a gtpase with a dual role of scaffold on which this precursor  is synthesized, and carrier to transfer it to the hydrogenase. coordinate structural and functional relationships between hydf and the two other maturases  are crucial for the h-cluster assembly. however, to date only qualitative analysis of this protein network have been provided. in this work we showed that  the interactions of hyde and hydg with hydf are distinct events, likely occurring in a precise functional order driven by different kinetic properties, independently of the hydf gtpase activity, which is instead involved in the dissociation of the maturases from the scaffold. we also found that hydf is able  to interact with the hydrogenase only when co-expressed with the two other maturases, indicating that under these conditions it harbors per se all the structural elements needed to transfer the h-cluster precursor, thus completing the maturation process. these results open new working perspectives aimed at improving the knowledge of how these complex metalloenzymes are biosynthesized.

TI  == a modified pathway for the production of acetone in escherichia coli.
AB  == a modified synthetic acetone operon was constructed. it consists of two genes from clostridium acetobutylicum (thla coding for thiolase and adc coding for acetoacetate decarboxylase) and one from bacillus subtilis or haemophilus influenzae (teii(srf) or ybgc, respectively, for thioesterase). expression of this operon in escherichia coli resulted in the production of acetone starting from the common metabolite acetyl-coa via acetoacetyl-coa and acetoacetate. the thioesterases do not need a coa acceptor for acetoacetyl-coa hydrolysis. thus, in contrast to the classic acetone pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum and related microorganisms which employ a coa transferase, the new pathway is acetate independent. the genetic background of the host strains was crucial. only e. coli strains hb101 and wl3 were able to produce acetone via the modified plasmid based pathway, up to 64mm and 42mm in 5-ml cultures, respectively. using glucose fed-batch cultures the concentration could be increased up to 122mm acetone with  hb101 carrying the recombinant plasmid puc19ayt (thioesterase from h. influenzae). the formation of acetone led to a decreased acetate production by e. coli.

TI  == a selection platform for carbon chain elongation using the coa-dependent pathway  to produce linear higher alcohols.
AB  == production of green chemicals and fuels using metabolically engineered organisms  has been a promising alternative to petroleum-based production. higher chain alcohols (c4-c8) are of interest because they can be used as chemical feedstock as well as fuels. recently, the feasibility of n-hexanol synthesis using escherichia coli has been demonstrated by extending the modified clostridium coa-dependent n-butanol synthesis pathway, thereby elongating carbon chain length via reactions in reversed beta-oxidation, (or beta-reduction). here, we developed an anaerobic growth selection platform that allows selection or enrichment of enzymes for increased synthesis of c6 and c8 linear alcohols. using this selection, we were able to improve the carbon flux towards the synthesis of c6 and c8 acyl-coa intermediates. replacement of the original enzyme clostridium acetobutylicum hbd with ralstonia eutropha homologue paah1 increased production of n-hexanol by 10-fold. further directed evolution by random mutagenesis of paah1 improved n-hexanol and n-octanol production. this anaerobic growth selection platform may be useful for selecting enzymes for production of long-chain alcohols and acids using this coa-dependent pathway.

TI  == [cloning and expression of key genes of butanol synthetic pathway in escherichia  coli].
AB  == objective: we constructed a recombinant escherichia coli strain for butanol production by cloning the cdna sequence of the key butanol synthetic pathway genes from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc824. methods: we amplified the genes of thil, adhe2 and bcs operon by pcr with c. acetobutylicum atcc824 genome as a template. we constructed the recombinant strain e. coli pbat (bcs operon-adhe2-thil/ptrc99a/mg1655). we used 0.1 mmol/l isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) to induce the recombinant e. coli pbat for 5  h for recombinant protein expression. we measured acetyl-coa acetyltransferase (thl), beta-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase (hbd), 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydratase (crt), butyryl-coa dehydrogenase (bcd) and butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (bydh)/butanol dehydrogenase (bdh) activities in e. coli mg1655 and e. coli pbat. the fermentation of e. coli pbat was done in flask in aerobic, micro-aerobic and anaerobic mode separately. results: in the recombinant e. coli  pbat, thl activity was 0.160 u/mg protein, about 30 times higher than that of e.  coli mg1655. hbd activity was 5 times higher than that of e. coli mg1655. crt activity was 1.53 u/mg protein whereas not detectable in e. coli mg1655. bcd activity was about 32 times higher than that of e. coli mg1655. in addition, the  results show that n-butanol could be produced under anaerobic and micro-aerobic conditions. the maximum n-buntanol concentration of 84 mg/l was detected in cultivation broth. conclusion: the key genes of butanol synthetic pathway were expressed in e. coli and the recombinant strains would offer an alternative strategy for butanol biosynthesis.

TI  == engineering a homobutanol fermentation pathway in escherichia coli eg03.
AB  == a homobutanol fermentation pathway was engineered in a derivative of escherichia  coli b (glucose [glycolysis] => 2 pyruvate + 2 nadh; pyruvate [pyruvate dehydrogenase] => acetyl-coa + nadh; 2 acetyl-coa [butanol pathway enzymes] + 4 nadh => butanol; summary stoichiometry: glucose => butanol). initially, the native fermentation pathways were eliminated from e. coli b by deleting the genes encoding for lactate dehydrogenase (ldha), acetate kinase (acka), fumarate reductase (frdabcd), pyruvate formate lyase (pflb), and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe), and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (aceef-lpd) was anaerobically expressed through promoter replacement. the resulting strain, e. coli eg03 (deltafrdabcd deltaldha deltaacka deltapflb delta adhe deltapdhr ::pflbp6-aceef-lpd deltamgsa), could generate 4 nadh for every glucose oxidized to two acetyl-coa through glycolysis and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. however, eg03 lost its ability for anaerobic growth due to the lack of nadh oxidation pathways. when the butanol pathway genes that encode for acetyl-coa acetyltransferase (thil), 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase (hbd), crotonase (crt), butyryl-coa dehydrogenase (bcd, etfa, etfb), and butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (adheii) were cloned from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824, and  expressed in e. coli eg03, a balanced nadh oxidation pathway was established for  homobutanol fermentation (glucose => 4 nadh + 2 acetyl-coa => butanol). this strain was able to convert glucose to butanol (1,254 mg l(-1)) under anaerobic condition.

TI  == genomic sequence of bacteriophage atcc 8074-b1 and activity of its endolysin and  engineered variants against clostridium sporogenes.
AB  == lytic bacteriophage atcc 8074-b1 produces large plaques on its host clostridium sporogenes. sequencing of the 47,595-bp genome allowed the identification of 82 putative open reading frames, including those encoding proteins for head and tail morphogenesis and lysis. however, sequences commonly associated with lysogeny were absent. orf 22 encodes an endolysin, cs74l, that shows homology to n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, and when expressed in escherichia coli, the  protein causes effective lysis of c. sporogenes cells when added externally. cs74l was also active on clostridium tyrobutyricum and clostridium acetobutylicum. the catalytic domain expressed alone (cs74l(1-177)) exhibited a similar activity and the same host range as the full-length endolysin. a chimeric endolysin consisting of the cs74l catalytic domain fused to the c-terminal domain of endolysin cd27l, derived from clostridium difficile bacteriophage phicd27, was produced. this chimera (cscd) lysed c. sporogenes cells with an activity equivalent to that of the catalytic domain alone. in contrast, the cd27l c-terminal domain reduced the efficacy of the cs74l catalytic domain when tested  against c. tyrobutyricum. the addition of the cd27l c-terminal domain did not enable the lysin to target c. difficile or other cd27l-sensitive bacteria.

TI  == integration of dna into bacterial chromosomes from plasmids without a counter-selection marker.
AB  == most bacteria can only be transformed with circular plasmids, so robust dna integration methods for these rely upon selection of single-crossover clones followed by counter-selection of double-crossover clones. to overcome the limited availability of heterologous counter-selection markers, here we explore novel dna integration strategies that do not employ them, and instead exploit (i) activation or inactivation of genes leading to a selectable phenotype, and (ii) asymmetrical regions of homology to control the order of recombination events. we focus here on the industrial biofuel-producing bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum, which previously lacked robust integration tools, but the approach we have developed is broadly applicable. large sequences can be delivered in a series of steps, as we demonstrate by inserting the chromosome of  phage lambda (minus a region apparently unstable in escherichia coli in our cloning context) into the chromosome of c. acetobutylicum in three steps. this work should open the way to reliable integration of dna including large synthetic constructs in diverse microorganisms.

TI  == improving fatty acid production in escherichia coli through the overexpression of malonyl coa-acyl carrier protein transacylase.
AB  == the microbial biosynthesis of free fatty acid, which can be used as precursors for the production of fuels or chemicals from renewable carbon sources, has attracted significant attention in recent years. free fatty acids can be produced by introducing an acyl-carrier protein (acp) thioesterase (te) gene into escherichia coli. the first committed step of fatty acid biosynthesis is the conversion of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa by an adenosine triphosphate (atp)-dependent acetyl-coa carboxylase followed by the conversion of malonyl-coa  to malonyl-acp through the enzyme malonyl coa-acyl carrier protein transacylase (mct; fabd). the e. coli fabd gene encoding mct has been cloned and studied. however, the effect of fabd overexpression in a fatty acid overproducing strain has not been examined. in this study, we examined the effect of fabd overexpression in a fatty acid overproducing strain carrying an acyl-acp te. specifically, the effect of overexpressing a fabd gene from four different organisms on fatty acid production was compared. the strains carrying a fabd gene from e. coli, streptomyces avermitilis ma-4680, or streptomyces coelicolor a3(2)  improved the free fatty acid production; these three strains produced more free fatty acids, about 11% more, than the control strain. the strain carrying a fabd  gene from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824, however, produced similar quantities of free fatty acids as the control strain. in addition, the three fabd overexpressed strains also have higher fatty acid/glucose yields. the results suggested that fabd overexpression can be used to improve free fatty acid production by increasing the malonyl-acp availability.

TI  == peptidoglycan turnover and recycling in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == bacterial cells are protected by an exoskeleton, the stabilizing and shape-maintaining cell wall, consisting of the complex macromolecule peptidoglycan. in view of its function, it could be assumed that the cell wall is a static structure. in truth, however, it is steadily broken down by peptidoglycan-cleaving enzymes during cell growth. in this process, named cell wall turnover, in one generation up to half of the preexisting peptidoglycan of a bacterial cell is released from the wall. this would result in a massive loss of  cell material, if turnover products were not be taken up and recovered. indeed, in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, peptidoglycan recovery has  been recognized as a complex pathway, named cell wall recycling. it involves about a dozen dedicated recycling enzymes that convey cell wall turnover products to peptidoglycan synthesis or energy pathways. whether gram-positive bacteria also recover their cell wall is currently questioned. given the much larger portion of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, however, recovery of the wall material would provide an even greater benefit in these organisms compared to gram-negatives. consistently, in many gram-positives, orthologs of recycling enzymes were identified, indicating that the cell wall may also be recycled in these organisms. this mini-review provides a compilation of information about cell wall turnover and recycling in gram-positive bacteria during cell growth and division, including recent findings relating to muropeptide recovery in bacillus subtilis and clostridium acetobutylicum from our group. furthermore, the impact of cell wall turnover and recycling on biotechnological processes is discussed.

TI  == characterization of an n-acetylmuramic acid/n-acetylglucosamine kinase of clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == we report here the cloning and characterization of a cytoplasmic kinase of clostridium acetobutylicum, named murk (for murein sugar kinase). the enzyme has  a unique specificity for both amino sugars of the bacterial cell wall, n-acetylmuramic acid (murnac) and n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac), which are phosphorylated at the 6-hydroxyl group. kinetic analyses revealed km values of 190 and 127 mum for murnac and glcnac, respectively, and a kcat value (65.0 s(-1)) that was 1.5-fold higher for the latter substrate. neither the non-n-acetylated forms of the cell wall sugars, i.e., glucosamine and/or muramic  acid, nor epimeric hexoses or 1,6-anhydro-murnac were substrates for the enzyme.  murk displays low overall amino acid sequence identity (24%) with human glcnac kinase and is the first characterized bacterial representative of the bcrad/badfg-like atpase family. we propose a role of murk in the recovery of muropeptides during cell wall rescue in c. acetobutylicum. the kinase was applied for high-sensitive detection of the amino sugars in cell wall preparations by radioactive phosphorylation.

TI  == enzyme mechanism as a kinetic control element for designing synthetic biofuel pathways.
AB  == living systems have evolved remarkable molecular functions that can be redesigned for in vivo chemical synthesis as we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biochemical principles for de novo construction of synthetic pathways. we have focused on developing pathways for next-generation biofuels as they require carbon to be channeled to product at quantitative yields. however, these  fatty acid-inspired pathways must manage the highly reversible nature of the enzyme components. for targets in the biodiesel range, the equilibrium can be driven to completion by physical sequestration of an insoluble product, which is  a mechanism unavailable to soluble gasoline-sized products. in this work, we report the construction of a chimeric pathway assembled from three different organisms for the high-level production of n-butanol (4,650 +/- 720 mg l(-)(1)) that uses an enzymatic chemical reaction mechanism in place of a physical step as a kinetic control element to achieve high yields from glucose (28%).

TI  == improving the clostridium acetobutylicum butanol fermentation by engineering the  strain for co-production of riboflavin.
AB  == solvent-producing clostridia are well known for their capacity to use a wide variety of renewable biomass and agricultural waste materials for biobutanol production. to investigate the possibility of co-production of a high value chemical during biobutanol production, the clostridium acetobutylicum riboflavin  operon ribgbah was over-expressed in c. acetobutylicum on escherichia coli-clostridium shuttle vector pjir750. constructs that either maintained the original c. acetobutylicum translational start codon or modified the start codons of ribg and ribb from ttg to atg were designed. riboflavin was successfully produced in both e. coli and c. acetobutylicum using these plasmids, and riboflavin could accumulate up to 27 mg/l in clostridium culture. furthermore, the c. acetobutylicum purine pathway was modified by over-expression of the clostridium purf gene, which encodes the enzyme prpp amidotransferase. the function of the plasmid pjaf bearing c. acetobutylicum purf was verified by its ability to complement an e. coli purf mutation. however, co-production of riboflavin with biobutanol by use of the purf over-expression plasmid was not improved under the experimental conditions examined. further rational mutation of the purf gene was conducted by replacement of amino acid codons d302 v and k325q  to make it similar to the feedback-resistant enzymes of other species. however, the co-expression of ribgbah and purfc in c. acetobutylicum also did not improve  riboflavin production. by buffering the culture ph, c. acetobutylicum atcc 824(pjpgn) could accumulate more than 70 mg/l riboflavin while producing 190 mm butanol in static cultures. riboflavin production was shown to exert no effect on solvent production at these levels.

TI  == genetic modification of critical enzymes and involved genes in butanol biosynthesis from biomass.
AB  == interest in biobutanol, a sustainable vehicle fuel, is increasing due to rising oil prices and concerns of surrounding climate change and the energy crisis. however, the costs of biobutanol with conventional abe fermentation by clostridium are higher than the cost of butanol from today's petrochemical processes. two major problems in the economic production of biobutanol are difficulty controlling the induction of a metabolic shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis and limitations imposed by severe product inhibition. with developments in biotechnology, and the completion of genome sequencing of clostridium, genetic modification is a viable method to improve the solvent yield and the butanol production ratio. the present article aims to highlight the latest research progress on overexpressing, inserting, knocking out, and knocking down genes of the key enzymes in the abe fermentation pathway and other relative  genes (such as genes coding for heat-shock proteins, operon, transcription, etc). recombinant manipulations of these genes in escherichiacoli and yeast have also been reported recently, although their butanol yields are lower than in clostridium. butanol production with solventogenic clostridia from various feedstocks is also evaluated in this review.

TI  == metabolite stress and tolerance in the production of biofuels and chemicals: gene-expression-based systems analysis of butanol, butyrate, and acetate stresses in the anaerobe clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == metabolite accumulation has pleiotropic, toxic, or beneficial effects on cell physiology, but such effects are not well understood at the molecular level. cells respond and adapt to metabolite stress by mechanisms largely unexplored, especially in the context of multiple and simultaneous stresses. solventogenic and related clostridia have an inherent advantage for production of biofuels and  chemicals directly from cellulosic material and other complex carbohydrates, but  issues of product/metabolite tolerance and related culture productivities remain. using dna microarray-based gene expression analysis, the transcriptional-stress responses of clostridium acetobutylicum to fermentation acids acetate and butyrate and the solvent product butanol were analyzed and compared in the context of cell physiology. ontological analysis demonstrated that stress by all  three metabolites resulted in upregulation of genes related to post-translational modifications and chaperone activity, and downregulation of the translation-machinery genes. motility genes were downregulated by acetate-stress  only. the general metabolite stress included upregulation of numerous stress genes (dnak, groes, groel, hsp90, hsp18, clpc, and htra), the solventogenic operon aad-ctfa-ctfb, and other solventogenic genes. acetate stress downregulated expression of the butyryl-coa- and butyrate-formation genes, while butyrate stress downregulated expression of acetate-formation genes. pyrimidine-biosynthesis genes were downregulated by most stresses, but purine-biosynthesis genes were upregulated by acetate and butyrate, possibly for  thiamine and histidine biosynthesis. methionine-biosynthesis genes were upregulated by acetate stress, indicating a possibly conserved stress response mechanism also observed in escherichia coli. nitrogen-fixation gene expression was upregulated by acetate stress. butyrate stress upregulated many iron-metabolism genes, riboflavin-biosynthesis genes, and several genes related to cellular repair from oxidative stress, such as perr and superoxide dismutases. butanol stress upregulated the glycerol metabolism genes glpa and glpf. surprisingly, metabolite stress had no apparent effect on the expression of the sporulation-cascade genes. it is argued that the list of upregulated genes in response to the three metabolite stresses includes several genes whose overexpression would likely impart tolerance, thus making the information generated in this study, a valuable source for the development of tolerant recombinant strains.

AB  == with the incessant fluctuations in oil prices and increasing stress from environmental pollution, renewed attention is being paid to the microbial production of biofuels from renewable sources. as a gasoline substitute, butanol  has advantages over traditional fuel ethanol in terms of energy density and hygroscopicity. a variety of cheap substrates have been successfully applied in the production of biobutanol, highlighting the commercial potential of biobutanol development. in this review, in order to better understand the process of acetone-butanol-ethanol production, traditional clostridia fermentation is discussed. sporulation is probably induced by solvent formation, and the molecular mechanism leading to the initiation of sporulation and solventogenesis  is also investigated. different strategies are employed in the metabolic engineering of clostridia that aim to enhancing solvent production, improve selectivity for butanol production, and increase the tolerance of clostridia to solvents. however, it will be hard to make breakthroughs in the metabolic engineering of clostridia for butanol production without gaining a deeper understanding of the genetic background of clostridia and developing more efficient genetic tools for clostridia. therefore, increasing attention has been  paid to the metabolic engineering of e. coli for butanol production. the importation and expression of a non-clostridial butanol-producing pathway in e. coli is probably the most promising strategy for butanol biosynthesis. due to the lower butanol titers in the fermentation broth, simultaneous fermentation and product removal techniques have been developed to reduce the cost of butanol recovery. gas stripping is the best technique for butanol recovery found so far.

TI  == construction of a synthetic ydbk-dependent pyruvate:h2 pathway in escherichia coli bl21(de3).
AB  == a synthetic pyruvate:h(2) pathway was constructed in escherichia coli bl21(de3) by co-expression of six proteins: e. coli ydbk, clostridium pasteurianum [4fe-4s]-ferredoxin, and clostridium acetobutylicum hydf, hyde, hydg, and hyda. the effect of cofactor addition and host strain on h(2) yield and fermentation product accumulation was studied, together with in vitro reconstitution of the entire pathway. the deletion of iscr and/or the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate to the medium enhanced the total and specific activity of recombinant ydbk and increased the yield of h(2) per glucose. it was concluded that the introduced pathway outcompeted other pyruvate-consuming reactions, and that the ability to compete for pyruvate at least in part was determined by total ydbk activity. the results demonstrate the successful construction of a high-yielding h(2) pathway in a microorganism that effectively does not synthesize any h(2). the additional co-expression of bacillus subtilis amye enabled starch-dependent h(2) synthesis in minimal media.

TI  == functions of the clostridium acetobutylicium fabf and fabz proteins in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  == background: the original anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway proposed by goldfine and bloch was based on in vivo labeling studies in clostridium butyricum atcc 6015 (now c. beijerinckii) but to date no dedicated unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme has been identified in clostridia. c.  acetobutylicium synthesizes the same species of unsaturated fatty acids as e. coli, but lacks all of the known unsaturated fatty acid synthetic genes identified in e. coli and other bacteria. a possible explanation was that two enzymes of saturated fatty acid synthesis of c. acetobutylicium, fabz and fabf might also function in the unsaturated arm of the pathway (a fabz homologue is known to be an unsaturated fatty acid synthetic enzyme in enterococci). results:  we report that the fabf homologue located within the fatty acid biosynthetic gene cluster of c. acetobutylicium functions in synthesis of both unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. expression of this protein in e. coli functionally replaced both the fabb and fabf proteins of the host in vivo and replaced e. coli fabb in a defined in vitro fatty acid synthesis system. in contrast the single c. acetobutylicium fabz homologue, although able to functionally replace e. coli fabz in vivo and in vitro, was unable to replace faba, the key dehydratase-isomerase of e. coli unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo and lacked isomerase activity in vitro. conclusion: thus, c. acetobutylicium introduces the double of unsaturated fatty acids by use of a novel and unknown enzyme.

TI  == engineering alternative butanol production platforms in heterologous bacteria.
AB  == alternative microbial hosts have been engineered as biocatalysts for butanol biosynthesis. the butanol synthetic pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum was first re-constructed in escherichia coli to establish a baseline for comparison to other hosts. whereas polycistronic expression of the pathway genes resulted in the production of 34 mg/l butanol, individual expression of pathway genes elevated titers to 200 mg/l. improved titers were achieved by co-expression of saccharomyces cerevisiae formate dehydrogenase while overexpression of e. coli glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to elevate glycolytic flux improved titers to 580 mg/l. pseudomonas putida and bacillus subtilis were also explored as alternative production hosts. polycistronic expression of butanol biosynthetic genes yielded butanol titers of 120 and 24 mg/l from p. putida and b. subtilis, respectively. production in the obligate aerobe p. putida was dependent upon expression of bcd-etfab. these results demonstrate the potential of engineering butanol biosynthesis in a variety of heterologous microorganisms, including those cultivated aerobically.

TI  == o2 and reactive oxygen species detoxification complex, composed of o2-responsive  nadh:rubredoxin oxidoreductase-flavoprotein a2-desulfoferrodoxin operon enzymes,  rubperoxin, and rubredoxin, in clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == clostridium acetobutylicum, an obligate anaerobe, grows normally under continuous-o(2)-flow culture conditions, where the cells consume o(2) proficiently. an o(2)-responsive nadh:rubredoxin oxidoreductase operon composed of three genes (nror, fpra2, and dsr), encoding nror, functionally uncharacterized flavoprotein a2 (fpra2), and the predicted superoxide reductase desulfoferrodoxin (dsr), has been proposed to participate in defense against o(2) stress. to functionally characterize these proteins, native nror from c. acetobutylicum, recombinant nror (rnror), fpra2, dsr, and rubredoxin (rd) expressed in escherichia coli were purified. purified native nror and rnror both  exhibited weak h(2)o(2)-forming nadh oxidase activity that was slightly activated by rd. a mixture of nror, rd, and fpra2 functions as an efficient h(2)o-forming nadh oxidase with a high affinity for o(2) (the k(m) for o(2) is 2.9 +/- 0.4 microm). a mixture of nror, rd, and dsr functions as an nadh-dependent o(2)(-) reductase. a mixture of nror, rd, and rubperoxin (rpr, a rubrerythrin homologue)  functions as an inefficient h(2)o-forming nadh oxidase but an efficient nadh peroxidase with a low affinity for o(2) and a high affinity for h(2)o(2) (the k(m)s for o(2) and h(2)o(2) are 303 +/- 39 microm and <or=1 microm, respectively). a gene encoding rd is dicistronically transcribed with a gene encoding a glutaredoxin (gd) homologue, and the expression levels of the genes encoding gd and rd were highly upregulated upon exposure to o(2). therefore, nror operon enzymes, together with rpr, efficiently function to scavenge o(2), o(2)(-), and h(2)o(2) by using an o(2)-responsive rubredoxin as a common electron carrier protein.

TI  == characterization of the posttranscriptional modifications in legionella pneumophila small-subunit ribosomal rna.
AB  == it is generally accepted that posttranscriptional modifications in rna play a role in the fine-tuning of rna function and the maintenance of rna structure. this article describes the characterization of the posttranscriptional modifications in legionella pneumophila 16s rrna by mass spectrometry and reverse transcriptase assays. eight modified nucleotides were identified and mapped in the 16s rrna sequence. situation of these data in relation to general 16s rrna modification patterns shows that l. pneumophila is relatively less modified, and  that the majority of the l. pneumophila 16s rrna modifications are conserved among the bacteria characterized so far (escherichia coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, thermus thermophilus, and thermotoga maritima).

TI  == reductive dioxygen scavenging by flavo-diiron proteins of clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == two flavo-diiron proteins (fdps), fpra1 and fpra2, are up-regulated when the strictly anaerobic solvent producer, clostridium acetobutylicum, is exposed to dioxygen. these two fdps were purified following heterologous overexpression in escherichia coli as n-terminal strep-tag fusion proteins. the recombinant fpra1 and fpra2 were found to be homodimeric and homotetrameric, respectively, and both fdps functioned as terminal components of nadh oxidases (nadh:o(2) oxidoreductases) when using c. acetobutylicum nadh:rubredoxin oxidoreductase (nror) and rubredoxin (rd) as electron transport intermediaries. both fdps catalyzed the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water with similar specific activities. the results are consistent with these fdps functioning as efficient scavengers of intracellular dioxygen under aerobic or microoxic growth  conditions.

TI  == replacing escherichia coli nad-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) with a nadp-dependent enzyme from clostridium acetobutylicum facilitates  nadph dependent pathways.
AB  == reactions requiring reducing equivalents, nad(p)h, are of enormous importance for the synthesis of industrially valuable compounds such as carotenoids, polymers, antibiotics and chiral alcohols among others. the use of whole-cell biocatalysis  can reduce process cost by acting as catalyst and cofactor regenerator at the same time; however, product yields might be limited by cofactor availability within the cell. thus, our study focussed on the genetic manipulation of a whole-cell system by modifying metabolic pathways and enzymes to improve the overall production process. in the present work, we genetically engineered an escherichia coli strain to increase nadph availability to improve the productivity of products that require nadph in its biosynthesis. the approach involved an alteration of the glycolysis step where glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (gap) is oxidized to 1,3 bisphophoglycerate (1,3-bpg). this reaction is catalyzed by nad-dependent endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) encoded by the gapa gene. we constructed a recombinant e. coli strain by replacing the native nad-dependent gapa gene with a nadp-dependent gapdh from clostridium acetobutylicum, encoded by the gene gapc. the beauty of this approach is that the recombinant e. coli strain produces 2 mol of nadph, instead of nadh,  per mole of glucose consumed. metabolic flux analysis showed that the flux through the pentose phosphate (pp) pathway, one of the main pathways that produce nadph, was reduced significantly in the recombinant strain when compared to that  of the parent strain. the effectiveness of the nadph enhancing system was tested  using the production of lycopene and epsilon-caprolactone as model systems using  two different background strains. the recombinant strains, with increased nadph availability, consistently showed significant higher productivity than the parent strains.

TI  == in situ product recovery of n-butanol using polymeric resins.
AB  == polymeric resins with high n-butanol adsorption affinities were identified from a candidate pool of commercially available materials representing a wide array of physical and chemical properties. resin hydrophobicity, which was dictated by the chemical structure of its constituent monomer units, most greatly influenced the  resin-aqueous equilibrium partitioning of n-butanol whereas ionic functionalization appeared to have no effect. in general, those materials derived from poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) possessed the greatest n-butanol affinity, while the adsorption potential of these resins was limited by their specific surface area. resins were tested for their ability to serve as effective in situ  product recovery (ispr) devices in the n-butanol fermentation by clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824. in small-scale batch fermentations, the addition of 0.05 kg/l dowex optipore sd-2 facilitated achievement of effective n-butanol titers as high as 2.22% (w/v), well above the inhibitory threshold of c. acetobutylicum atcc 824, and nearly twice that of traditional, single-phase fermentations. retrieval of n-butanol from resins via thermal treatment was demonstrated with high efficiency and predicted to be economically favorable. due to its modular nature, the proposed ispr design exhibits strong potential for compatibility with future n-butanol fermentation efforts.

TI  == the two-component system phopr of clostridium acetobutylicum is involved in phosphate-dependent gene regulation.
AB  == the phopr gene locus of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 comprises two genes,  phop and phor. deduced proteins are predicted to represent a response regulator and sensor kinase of a phosphate-dependent two-component regulatory system. we analyzed the expression patterns of phopr in p(i)-limited chemostat cultures and  in response to p(i) pulses. a basic transcription level under high-phosphate conditions was shown, and a significant increase in mrna transcript levels was found when external p(i) concentrations dropped below 0.3 mm. in two-dimensional  gel electrophoresis experiments, a 2.5-fold increase in phop was observed under p(i)-limiting growth conditions compared to growth with an excess of p(i). at least three different transcription start points for phop were determined by primer extension analyses. proteins phop and an n-terminally truncated *phor were individually expressed heterologously in escherichia coli and purified. autophosphorylation of *phor and phosphorylation of phop were shown in vitro. electromobility shift assays proved that there was a specific binding of phop to  the promoter region of the phosphate-regulated pst operon of c. acetobutylicum.

TI  == clostridium acetobutylicum 8-oxoguanine dna glycosylase (ogg) differs from eukaryotic oggs with respect to opposite base discrimination.
AB  == during repair of damaged dna, the oxidized base 8-oxoguanine (8-oxog) is removed  by 8-oxoguanine-dna glycosylase (ogg) in eukaryotes and most archaea, whereas in  most bacteria it is removed by formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase (fpg). we report the first characterization of a bacterial ogg, clostridium acetobutylicum  ogg (cacogg). like human ogg1 and escherichia coli fpg (ecofpg), cacogg excised 8-oxoguanine. however, unlike hogg1 and ecofpg, cacogg showed little preference for the base opposite the damage during base excision and removed 8-oxoguanine from single-stranded dna. thus, our results showed unambiguous qualitative functional differences in vitro between cacogg and both hogg1 and ecofpg. cacogg  differs in sequence from the eukaryotic enzymes at two sequence positions, m132 and f179, which align with amino acids (r154 and y203) in human ogg1 (hogg1) found to be involved in opposite base interaction. to address the sequence basis  for functional differences with respect to opposite base interactions, we prepared three cacogg variants, m132r, f179y, and m132r/f179y. all three variants showed a substantial increase in specificity for 8-oxog.c relative to 8-oxog.a. while we were unable to definitively associate these qualitative functional differences with differences in selective pressure between eukaryotes, clostridia, and other bacteria, our results are consistent with the idea that evolution of ogg function is based on kinetic control of repair.

TI  == biosynthesis of enantiopure (s)-3-hydroxybutyric acid in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == a biosynthetic pathway for the production of (s)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (s3hb) from glucose was established in recombinant escherichia coli by introducing the beta-ketothiolase gene from ralstonia eutropha h16, the (s)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa  dehydrogenase gene from r. eutropha h16, or clostridium acetobutylicum atcc824, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coa hydrolase gene from bacillus cereus atcc14579. artificial operon consisting of these genes was constructed and was expressed in  e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus under t7 promoter by isopropyl beta-d: -thiogalactoside (iptg) induction. recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus expressing the beta-ketothiolase gene, the (s)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase gene, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coa hydrolase gene could synthesize enantiomerically pure s3hb to the concentration of 0.61 g l(-1) from 20 g l(-1) of glucose in luria-bertani medium. fed-batch cultures of recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus were carried out to achieve higher titer of s3hb with varying induction time and glucose concentration during fermentation. protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm iptg when cell concentration reached 10 and 20 g l(-1) (od(600) = 30 and 60), respectively. when protein expression was induced at 60 of od(600) and glucose was fed to the concentration of 15 g l(-1), 10.3 g l(-1) of s3hb was obtained in 38 h with the s3hb productivity of 0.21 g l(-1)h(-1). lowering glucose concentration to 5 g l(-1) and induction of protein expression at 30 of od(600) significantly reduced final s3hb concentration to 3.7 g l(-1), which also resulted in the decrease of the s3hb productivity to 0.05 g l(-1)h(-1).

TI  == heat-shock protein hspa mimics the function of phasins sensu stricto in recombinant strains of escherichia coli accumulating polythioesters or polyhydroxyalkanoates.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (phas) are synthesized by unspecific pha synthases and  deposited as energy and carbon storage granules in the cytoplasm of many prokaryotes. the number and size of the granules depend on the presence of phasins which are amphiphilic structural proteins occurring at the granule surface. recently, it was shown that polythioesters (ptes) are also synthesized by pha synthases. to increase the yield of these polymers, the role of recombinant phasins was analysed in an artificial pha-producing escherichia coli  strain. overexpressed phap1 from ralstonia eutropha h16 affected poly(3-mercaptopropionate) [poly(3mp)] and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3hb)] accumulation in recombinant e. coli, which expressed the non-natural bpec pathway consisting of butyrate kinase and phosphotransbutyrylase from clostridium acetobutylicum and pha synthase from thiococcus pfennigii. for this, bpec-carrying e. coli with and without phap1 was cultivated in presence of glucose as carbon source for growth plus 3-mercaptopropionate or 3-hydroxybutyrate as precursor substrates for poly(3mp) or poly(3hb) biosynthesis, respectively. in the presence of phap1, the recombinant e. coli produced about 50 or 68 % more poly(3mp) or poly(3hb), respectively. therefore, coexpression of phap1 alongside the bpec pathway is important for optimizing strains towards enhanced pha or pte production. furthermore, in the absence of phap1, large amounts of the 16 kda heat-shock protein hspa were synthesized and bound to the granule surface. unusual small granules occurred in the cells of the recombinant e. coli strains. the diameter of the poly(3mp) granules was only 55+/-12 nm or 105+/-12 nm, and of the poly(3hb) granules only 56+/-10 or 110+/-22 nm in the presence or absence of phap1, respectively. this explains why no single granules capable of accumulating phas or ptes occurred in the recombinant e. coli, unlike in phap1-negative mutants of r. eutropha. obviously, hspa mimics the phasin, thereby preventing coalescence of granules into one single granule. however, the effect of phap1 on granule size and on amounts of accumulated polymers was more severe than that of hspa.

AB  == the pst operon of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 comprises five genes, psts, pstc, psta, pstb, and phou, and shows a gene architecture identical to that of escherichia coli. deduced proteins are predicted to represent a high-affinity phosphate-specific abc (atp-binding cassette) transport system (pst) and a protein homologous to phou, a negative phosphate regulon regulator. we analyzed the expression patterns of the pst operon in p(i)-limited chemostat cultures during acid production at ph 5.8 or solvent production at ph 4.5 and in response  to p(i) pulses. specific mrna transcripts were found only when external p(i) concentrations had dropped below 0.2 mm. two specific transcripts were detected,  a 4.7-kb polycistronic mrna spanning the whole operon and a quantitatively dominating 1.2-kb mrna representing the first gene, psts. the mrna levels clearly differed depending on the external ph. the amounts of the full-length mrna detected were about two times higher at ph 5.8 than at ph 4.5. the level of psts  mrna increased by a factor of at least 8 at ph 5.8 compared to ph 4.5 results. primer extension experiments revealed only one putative transcription start point 80 nucleotides upstream of psts. thus, additional regulatory sites are proposed in the promoter region, integrating two different extracellular signals, namely,  depletion of inorganic phosphate and the ph of the environment. after phosphate pulses were applied to a phosphate-limited chemostat we observed faster phosphate consumption at ph 5.8 than at ph 4.5, although higher optical densities were recorded at ph 4.5.

TI  == studies on inhibition of transformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene catalyzed by fe-only hydrogenase from clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the major enzyme in clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 leading to transformation of tnt has been reported to be the fe-only hydrogenase. in this study, we examine the effect of inhibitors of hydrogenase on tnt reduction by clostridial extracts. these experiments further demonstrate the major role of hydrogenase in tnt transformation. the c. acetobutylicum hydrogenase is closely related to that of c. pasteurianum; and can be fitted to the x-ray crystal structure with a root mean square deviation of 1.18 angstroms for the calpha atoms of the generated 3d  simulation model. the hyd1, hyd2, and hyd3 antibodies generated against hydrogenase reacted with both the hydrogenase in cell extracts and with c. acetobutylicum hydrogenase expressed in escherichia coli. inhibition studies using antibodies against fe-only hydrogenase from c. acetobutylicum indicated that the transformation of tnt by crude cell extracts was completely inhibited by hyd2 antibody (to amino acid 415-428) whereas antibodies hyd1 (to residues 1-16)  and hyd3 (to amino acid 424-448) inhibited less effectively. the tnt transforming activity of the cell extract was retained when hyd2 antibody pretreated with purified but enzymatically inactive recombinant hydrogenase was added to the extract. addition of the transition metal cu2+ to extracts completely inhibited the transformation of tnt suggesting the destruction of [4fe-4s] centers which are essential for transfer of electrons from the h2-activating site to tnt. growth of c. acetobutylicum was also inhibited by 0.5 mm cu2+ and hg2+ ions. the  triazine dye, procion red and the nitroimidazole drug, metronidazole inhibit tnt  reduction. the inhibition studies using antibodies, procion red, metronidazole, and transition metals suggest that different portions of hydrogenase are required for effective tnt reduction.

TI  == functional studies of [fefe] hydrogenase maturation in an escherichia coli biosynthetic system.
AB  == maturation of [fefe] hydrogenases requires the biosynthesis and insertion of the  catalytic iron-sulfur cluster, the h cluster. two radical s-adenosylmethionine (sam) proteins proposed to function in h cluster biosynthesis, hydef and hydg, were recently identified in the hydef-1 mutant of the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii (m. c. posewitz, p. w. king, s. l. smolinski, l. zhang, m. seibert, and m. l. ghirardi, j. biol. chem. 279:25711-25720, 2004). previous efforts to study [fefe] hydrogenase maturation in escherichia coli by coexpression of c. reinhardtii hydef and hydg and the hyda1 [fefe] hydrogenase were hindered by instability of the hydef and hydg expression clones. a more stable [fefe] hydrogenase expression system has been achieved in e. coli by cloning and coexpression of hyde, hydf, and hydg from the bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum. coexpression of the c. acetobutylicum maturation proteins with various algal and bacterial [fefe] hydrogenases in e. coli resulted in purified enzymes with specific activities that were similar to those of the enzymes purified from native sources. in the case of structurally complex [fefe] hydrogenases, maturation of the catalytic sites could occur in the absence of an  accessory iron-sulfur cluster domain. initial investigations of the structure and function of the maturation proteins hyde, hydf, and hydg showed that the highly conserved radical-sam domains of both hyde and hydg and the gtpase domain of hydf were essential for achieving biosynthesis of active [fefe] hydrogenases. together, these results demonstrate that the catalytic domain and a functionally  complete set of hyd maturation proteins are fundamental to achieving biosynthesis of catalytic [fefe] hydrogenases.

TI  == a wide host-range metagenomic library from a waste water treatment plant yields a novel alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase.
AB  == using dna obtained from the metagenome of an anaerobic digestor in a waste water  treatment plant, we constructed a gene library cloned in the wide host-range cosmid plafr3. one cosmid enabled rhizobium leguminosarum to grow on ethanol as sole carbon and energy source, this being due to the presence of a gene, termed adhemeta. the adhemeta protein most closely resembles the adhe alcohol dehydrogenase of clostridium acetobutylicum, where it catalyses the formation of  ethanol and butanol in a two-step reductive process. however, cloned adhemeta did not confer ethanol utilization ability to escherichia coli or to pseudomonas aeruginosa, even though it was transcribed in both these hosts. further, cell-free extracts of e. coli and r. leguminosarum containing cloned adhemeta had butanol and ethanol dehydrogenase activities when assayed in vitro. in contrast to the well-studied adhe proteins of c. acetobutylicum and e. coli, the enzyme specified by adhemeta is not inactivated by oxygen and it enables alcohol to be catabolized. cloned adhemeta did, however, confer one phenotype to e. coli. adhe- mutants of e. coli fail to ferment glucose and introduction of adhemeta restored  the growth of such mutants when grown under fermentative conditions. these observations show that the use of wide host-range vectors enhances the efficacy with which metagenomic libraries can be screened for genes that confer novel functions.

TI  == metabolic engineering of clostridium acetobutylicum for the industrial production of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol.
AB  == clostridium butyricum is to our knowledge the best natural 1,3-propanediol producer from glycerol and the only microorganism identified so far to use a coenzyme b12-independent glycerol dehydratase. however, to develop an economical  process of 1,3-propanediol production, it would be necessary to improve the strain by a metabolic engineering approach. unfortunately, no genetic tools are currently available for c. butyricum and all our efforts to develop them have been so far unsuccessful. to obtain a better "vitamin b12-free" biological process, we developed a metabolic engineering strategy with clostridium acetobutylicum. the 1,3-propanediol pathway from c. butyricum was introduced on a plasmid in several mutants of c. acetobutylicum altered in product formation. the dg1(pspd5) recombinant strain was the most efficient strain and was further characterized from a physiological and biotechnological point of view. chemostat  cultures of this strain grown on glucose alone produced only acids (acetate, butyrate and lactate) and a high level of hydrogen. in contrast, when glycerol was metabolized in chemostat culture, 1,3-propanediol became the major product, the specific rate of acid formation decreased and a very low level of hydrogen was observed. in a fed-batch culture, the dg1(pspd5) strain was able to produce 1,3-propanediol at a higher concentration (1104 mm) and productivity than the natural producer c. butyricum vpi 3266. furthermore, this strain was also successfully used for very long term continuous production of 1,3-propanediol at  high volumetric productivity (3 g l-1 h-1) and titer (788 mm).

AB  == beta-glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from ruminococcus gnavus e1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. the complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp dna fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from r. gnavus e1 was determined. five orfs were detected on this fragment: three complete orfs (orf2, gus and orf3) and two partial orfs (orf4 and orf5). the products of orf2 and orf3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (ptss), such as escherichia coli bglc,  bacillus subtilis bglp and bacillus halodurans pts enzyme ii. the product of orf5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bgla). the gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of lactobacillus gasseri (69%), e. coli (61%), clostridium perfringens (59%) and staphylococcus aureus (58%). by complementing an e. coli strain in which the uida gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the r. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes orf2, orf3 and orf5.

TI  == substrate-induced production and secretion of cellulases by clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 is a solventogenic bacterium that grows heterotrophically on a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, cellobiose, xylose, and lichenan, a linear polymer of beta-1,3- and beta-1,4-linked beta-d-glucose units. c. acetobutylicum does not degrade cellulose, although its  genome sequence contains several cellulase-encoding genes and a complete cellulosome cluster of cellulosome genes. in the present study, we demonstrate that a low but significant level of induction of cellulase activity occurs during growth on xylose or lichenan. the celf gene, located in the cellulosome-like gene cluster and coding for a unique cellulase that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 48, was cloned in escherichia coli, and antibodies were raised against the overproduced celf protein. a western blot analysis suggested a possible catabolite repression by glucose or cellobiose and an up-regulation by lichenan or xylose of the extracellular production of celf by c. acetobutylicum. possible  reasons for the apparent inability of c. acetobutylicum to degrade cellulose are  discussed.

TI  == cloning, characterization, and functional expression of the klebsiella oxytoca xylodextrin utilization operon (xyntb) in escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli is being developed as a biocatalyst for bulk chemical production from inexpensive carbohydrates derived from lignocellulose. potential substrates  include the soluble xylodextrins (xyloside, xylooligosaccharide) and xylobiose that are produced by treatments designed to expose cellulose for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. adjacent genes encoding xylobiose uptake and hydrolysis were cloned from klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 and are functionally expressed in ethanologenic e. coli. the xylosidase encoded by xynb contains the cog3507 domain characteristic of glycosyl hydrolase family 43. the xynt gene encodes a membrane  protein containing the melb domain (cog2211) found in na(+)/melibiose symporters  and related proteins. these two genes form a bicistronic operon that appears to be regulated by xylose (xylr) and by catabolite repression in both k. oxytoca and recombinant e. coli. homologs of this operon were found in klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus lactis, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, and bacillus subtilis  based on sequence comparisons. based on similarities in protein sequence, the xyntb genes in k. oxytoca appear to have originated from a gram-positive ancestor related to l. lactis. functional expression of xynb allowed ethanologenic e. coli to metabolize xylodextrins (xylosides) containing up to six xylose residues without the addition of enzyme supplements. 4-o-methylglucuronic acid substitutions at the nonreducing termini of soluble xylodextrins blocked further  degradation by the xynb xylosidase. the rate of xylodextrin utilization by recombinant e. coli was increased when a full-length xynt gene was included with  xynb, consistent with xynt functioning as a symport. hydrolysis rates were inversely related to xylodextrin chain length, with xylobiose as the preferred substrate. xylodextrins were utilized more rapidly by recombinant e. coli than k. oxytoca m5a1 (the source of xynt and xynb). xynb exhibited weak arabinosidase activity, 3% that of xylosidase.

AB  == in previous studies, we showed that cofactor manipulations can potentially be used as a tool in metabolic engineering. in this study, sugars similar to glucose, that can feed into glycolysis and pyruvate production, but with different oxidation states, were used as substrates. this provided a simple way of testing the effect of manipulating the nadh/nad+ ratio or the availability of  nadh on the metabolic patterns of escherichia coli under anaerobic conditions and on the production of 1,2-propanediol (1,2-pd), which requires nadh for its synthesis. production of 1,2-pd was achieved by overexpressing the two enzymes methylglyoxal synthase from clostridium acetobutylicum and glycerol dehydrogenase from e. coli. in addition, the effect of eliminating a pathway competing for nadh by using a ldh(-) strain (without lactate dehydrogenase activity) on the production of 1,2-pd was investigated. the oxidation state of the carbon source significantly affected the yield of metabolites, such as ethanol, acetate and lactate. however, feeding a more reduced carbon source did not increase the yield of 1,2-pd. the production of 1,2-pd with glucose as the carbon source was improved by the incorporation of a ldh(-) mutation. the results of these experiments indicate that our current 1,2-pd production system is not limited by  nadh, but rather by the pathways following the formation of methylglyoxal.

TI  == characterization of the cipa scaffolding protein and in vivo production of a minicellulosome in clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the cipa gene encoding the clostridium acetobutylicum scaffolding protein cipa was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. cipa contains an n-terminal signal  peptide, a family 3a cellulose-binding domain (cbd), five type i cohesin domains, and six hydrophilic domains. the uniqueness of cipa lies in the enchainment of cohesin domains that are all separated by a hydrophilic domain. affinity-purified cipa was used in equilibrium-binding experiments to characterize the interaction  of cipa with crystalline cellulose. a k(d) of 0.038 micro m and a [c](max) of 0.43 micro mol of cipa bound per g of avicel were determined. a mini-cipa polypeptide consisting of a cbd3a and two cohesin domains was overexpressed in c. acetobutylicum, yielding the in vivo formation of a minicellulosome. this is to our knowledge the first demonstration of the in vivo assembly of a recombinant minicellulosome.

TI  == cloning and molecular characterization of an immunogenic liga protein of leptospira interrogans.
AB  == a clone expressing a novel immunoreactive leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein a of 130 kda (liga) from leptospira interrogans serovar pomona type kennewicki was isolated by screening a genomic dna library with serum from a mare that had recently aborted due to leptospiral infection. liga is encoded by an open reading frame of 3,675 bp, and the deduced amino acid sequence consists of a series of 90-amino-acid tandem repeats. a search of the ncbi database found that homology of the liga repeat region was limited to an immunoglobulin-like domain of the bacterial intimin binding protein of escherichia coli, the cell adhesion domain of clostridium acetobutylicum, and the invasin of yersinia pestis. secondary structure prediction analysis indicates that liga consists mostly of beta sheets  with a few alpha-helical regions. no liga was detectable by immunoblot analysis of lysates of the leptospires grown in vitro at 30 degrees c or when cultures were shifted to 37 degrees c. strikingly, immunohistochemistry on kidney from leptospira-infected hamsters demonstrated liga expression. these findings suggest that liga is specifically induced only in vivo. sera from horses, which aborted as a result of natural leptospira infection, strongly recognize liga. liga is the first leptospiral protein described to have 12 tandem repeats and is also the first to be expressed only during infection. thus, liga may have value in serodiagnosis or as a protective immunogen in novel vaccines.

TI  == clostridium as a tumor-specific delivery system of therapeutic proteins.
AB  == the feasibility of gene therapy strategies in cancer treatment still has important pitfalls. transfer of therapeutic proteins to the hypoxic/necrotic 'extracellular' microenvironment of solid tumors, based on the engineering of nonpathogenic clostridia is proposed as an alternative methodology. using the rat rhabdomyosarcoma r1 in vivo tumor model, we demonstrated that clostridium species colonized the tumors, whereas proliferation of these bacteria was absent in normal tissues. c. acetobutylicum was genetically engineered to express and secrete either mtnf-alpha or the e. coli cytosine deaminase. quantitative in vitro data showed stability of the vectors, and significant levels of biologically active therapeutic proteins in lysates and supernatants of recombinant clostridia. administration of either of these recombinant clostridium strains to tumor-bearing rats resulted in the presence of active proteins in the  tumor tissue. based on these data and supported by its selective colonization pattern and safety, the clostridium gene transfer system offers a potential application in anti-cancer therapies.

AB  == the adhe2 gene of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824, coding for an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (aadh), was characterized from molecular and biochemical points of view. the 2,577-bp adhe2 codes for a 94.4-kda protein. adhe2 is expressed, as a monocistronic operon, in alcohologenic cultures and not  in solventogenic cultures. primer extension analysis identified two transcriptional start sites 160 and 215 bp upstream of the adhe2 start codon. the expression of adhe2 from a plasmid in the dg1 mutant of c. acetobutylicum, a mutant cured of the psol1 megaplasmid, restored butanol production and provided elevated activities of nadh-dependent butyraldehyde and butanol dehydrogenases. the recombinant adhe2 protein expressed in e. coli as a strep-tag fusion protein  and purified to homogeneity also demonstrated nadh-dependent butyraldehyde and butanol dehydrogenase activities. this is the second aadh identified in c. acetobutylicum atcc 824, and to our knowledge this is the first example of a bacterium with two aadhs. it is noteworthy that the two corresponding genes, adhe and adhe2, are carried by the psol1 megaplasmid of c. acetobutylicum atcc 824.

TI  == molecular analysis of the mannitol operon of clostridium acetobutylicum encoding  a phosphotransferase system and a putative pts-modulated regulator.
AB  == clostridium acetobutylicum dsm 792 accumulates and phosphorylates mannitol via a  phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts). pep-dependent mannitol phosphorylation by extracts of cells grown on mannitol required both soluble and membrane fractions. neither the soluble nor the membrane fraction could be complemented by the opposite fraction prepared from glucose-grown cells, indicating that the mannitol-specific pts consists of both a soluble (iia) and a membrane-bound (iicb) component. the mannitol (mtl) operon of c. acetobutylicum dsm 792 comprises four genes in the order mtlarfd. sequence analysis of deduced protein products indicated that the mtla and mtlf genes respectively encode the iicb and iia components of the mannitol pts, which is a member of the fructose-mannitol (fru) family. the mtld gene product is a mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase, while mtlr encodes a putative transcriptional regulator. mtlr contains two pts regulatory domains (prds), which have been found in a number of dna-binding transcriptional regulators and in transcriptional antiterminators of the escherichia coli bglg family. also, near the c-terminus is a well-conserved signature motif characteristic of members of the iia(fru)/iia(mtl)/iia(ntr) pts protein family. these regions are probably the sites of pts-dependent phosphorylation to regulate the activity of the protein. a helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif was not found in mtlr. transcriptional analysis of the mtl genes by northern blotting indicated that the genes were transcribed as a polycistronic operon, expression of which was induced by mannitol and repressed by glucose. primer extension experiments identified a transcriptional start point 42 bp upstream of the mtla start codon. two catabolite-responsive elements (cres), one of which overlapped the putative -35 region of the promoter, were located within the 100 bp upstream of the start codon. these sequences may be involved in regulation of expression of the operon.

TI  == differential regulation of two thiolase genes from clostridium acetobutylicum dsm 792.
AB  == thiolase of clostridium acetobutylicum is an important enzyme involved in both, acid and solvent fermentation. two thiolase genes (thla and thib) have been cloned and sequenced from clostridium acetobutylicum dsm 792, showing high homology to each other and to thiolases of pha-synthesizing bacteria. the thla gene is identical to the gene already cloned and sequenced from strain atcc 824 (stim-herndon et al., 1995, gene 154: 81-85). using primer extension and s1 nuclease analysis a transcriptional start site was identified 102 bp upstream of  the thla start codon. this site was preceded by a region that exhibits high similarity to the sigma70 consensus promoter sequences of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. regulation of thla and thlb was studied at the transcriptional level to elucidate the specific function of each gene. non-radioactive primer extension analysis using fluorescein-labelled oligonucleotides and northern blot analysis revealed high levels of thla transcripts in acid- and solvent-producing cells. during an induced shift of a continuous culture from acid to solvent formation, the transcript level transiently decreased to a minimum, 3 to 7 h after induction. the thla transcript length is about 1.4 kb, indicating a monocistronic organisation, whereas genetic  organization and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr analysis indicated that thlb forms an operon with two other adjacent genes, thlr and thlc. transcription and regulation of the thlb operon was studied using rtpcr and showed a very low expression in acid- and solvent-producing cells. heterologously expressed clostridial thlb showed high thiolase activity in escherichia coli. the n-terminal part of thlr possesses a potential helix-turn-helix motif and shows significant homology to regulatory proteins belonging to the tetr/acrr family of  transcriptional regulators. thlr possibly acts as a transcriptional repressor of  thlb operon expression. the data provide strong evidence that thla is involved in the metabolism of both acid and solvent formation, whereas the physiological function of thlb has yet to be elucidated.

AB  == we report the cloning and characterization of the gyra gene of the mycoplasma hominis dna gyrase, which was previously shown to be associated with quinolone resistance in this organism. the 2,733-bp gyra gene encodes a protein of 911 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 102.5 kda. as expected, m. hominis gyra exhibits higher homology with the gyra subunits of the gram-positive bacteria clostridium acetobutylicum, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus than with its escherichia coli counterpart. knowing the entire sequence of the gyra gene of m. hominis could be very useful for confirming the role of the gyra subunit in fluoroquinolone resistance. twenty-nine mutants of m. hominis were selected stepwise for resistance to trovafloxacin, a new potent fluoroquinolone, and their gyra, gyrb, parc, and pare quinolone resistance-determining regions were characterized. three rounds of selection yielded 3 first-step, 12 second-step, and 14 third-step mutants. the first-step mutants harbored a single substitution, glu460-->lys (e. coli coordinates), in pare. gyra changes, ser83-->leu, glu87-->lys, and ala119-->glu or val, were found only in the second round of selection. at the third step, additional substitutions, at parc ser80, ser81, and glu84 and pare leu440, associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones, appeared. thus, high-level resistance to trovafloxacin required three steps and was associated with alterations in both fluoroquinolone targets. according to these genetic data, in m. hominis, as in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, topoisomerase iv seems to be the primary target of trovafloxacin.

TI  == characterization of recombinant strains of the clostridium acetobutylicum butyrate kinase inactivation mutant: need for new phenomenological models for solventogenesis and butanol inhibition?
AB  == two metabolic engineering tools, namely gene inactivation and gene overexpression, were employed to examine the effects of two genetic modifications on the fermentation characteristics of clostridium acetobutylicum. inactivation of the butyrate kinase gene (buk) was examined using strain pjc4bk, while the combined effect of buk inactivation and overexpression of the aad gene-encoding the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogense (aad) used in butanol formation-was examined using strain pjc4bk(ptaad). the two strains were characterized in controlled ph > or = 5.0 fermentations, and by a recently enhanced method of metabolic flux analysis. strain pjc4bk was previously genetically characterized, and fermentation experiments at ph > or = 5.5 demonstrated good, but not exceptional, solvent-production capabilities. here, we show that this strain is a solvent superproducer in ph > or = 5.0 fermentations producing 225 mm (16.7 g/l) of butanol, 76 mm of acetone (4.4 g/l), and 57 mm (2.6 g/l) of ethanol. strain pjc4bk(ptaad) produced similar amounts of butanol and acetone but 98 mm (4.5 g/l) of ethanol. both strains overcame the 180 mm (13 g/l) butanol toxicity limit, without any selection for butanol tolerance. work with strain pjc4bk(ptaad) is the first reported use of dual antibiotic selection in c. acetobutylicum. one antibiotic was used for selection of strain pjc4bk while the second antibiotic selected for the ptaad presence. overexpression of aad from ptaad resulted in increased ethanol production but did not increase butanol titers, thus indicating that aad did not limit butanol production under these fermentation conditions. metabolic flux analysis showed a decrease in butyrate formation fluxes by up to 75% and an increase in acetate formation fluxes of up to 100% during early growth. the mean specific butanol and ethanol formation fluxes increased significantly in these recombinant strains, up to 300% and 400%, respectively. onset of solvent production occurred during the exponential-growth phase when the culture optical density was very low and when total and undissociated butyric acid levels were <1 mm. butyrate levels were low throughout all fermentations, never exceeding 20 mm. thus, threshold butyrate concentrations are not necessary  for solvent production in these stains, suggesting the need for a new phenomenological model to explain solvent formation.

AB  == the coenzyme a (coa)-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) catalyzes a key reaction in the acetone- and butanol (solvent)-producing clostridia. it reduces acetyl-coa and butyryl-coa to the corresponding aldehydes, which are then reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) to form ethanol and 1-butanol. the aldh of clostridium beijerinckii nrrl b593 was purified. it had no adh activity, was nad(h) specific, and was more active with butyraldehyde than with acetaldehyde. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified aldh was determined. the open  reading frame preceding the ctfa gene (encoding a subunit of the solvent-forming  coa transferase) of c. beijerinckii nrrl b593 was identified as the structural gene (ald) for the aldh. the ald gene encodes a polypeptide of 468 amino acid residues with a calculated m(r) of 51, 353. the position of the ald gene in c. beijerinckii nrrl b593 corresponded to that of the aad/adhe gene (encoding an aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase) of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 and dsm 792. in southern analyses, a probe derived from the c. acetobutylicum aad/adhe gene did not hybridize to restriction fragments of the genomic dnas of c. beijerinckii and two other species of solvent-producing clostridia. in contrast,  a probe derived from the c. beijerinckii ald gene hybridized to restriction fragments of the genomic dna of three solvent-producing species but not to those  of c. acetobutylicum, indicating a key difference among the solvent-producing clostridia. the amino acid sequence of the aldh of c. beijerinckii nrrl b593 was  most similar (41% identity) to those of the eute gene products (coa-acylating aldhs) of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, whereas it was about 26% identical to the aldh domain of the aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenases of c. acetobutylicum, e. coli, lactococcus lactis, and amitochondriate protozoa. the predicted secondary structure of the c. beijerinckii aldh suggests the presence of an atypical rossmann fold for nad(+) binding. a comparison of the proposed catalytic pockets of the coa-dependent and coa-independent aldhs identified 6 amino acids that may contribute to interaction with coa.

TI  == molecular cloning of the dnak gene region from bacillus sphaericus in the context of genomic comparisons.
AB  == the dnak gene region of bacillus sphaericus was cloned as a 3.8 kb hindiii fragment and an overlapping 1.7 kb ecori fragment by using an internal b. sphaericus specific dnak gene probe generated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). complete dna sequencing of the two fragments revealed three complete open reading frames (orfs). these orfs exhibited a high degree of identity to the grpe dnak, and dnaj heat shock genes from other gram-positive bacteria. the order of the genes was found to be grpe-dnak-dnaj. additionally, the 5'-end and 3'-end contained amino acid sequences that were homologous to the c-terminal sequence of the hrca gene and the n-terminal sequence of orf35 (yqet), respectively, from bacillus subtilis. the entire hrca gene from b. sphaericus was then isolated by high-fidelity pcr and completely sequenced. a transcription stop site is located  between the dnak and dnaj genes but not after the dnaj gene. consistent with this observation, the dnaj gene is immediately followed by an orf that shows a high degree of identity to orf35 from b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the presence of orf35 is not indicated in other genera representing the gram-positive bacteria. the amino acid sequence of orf35  exhibited nearly 30% identity with the methyltransferase for large subunit ribosomal protein l11 from gram-negative proteobacteria and the related protein from cyanobacteria, other gram-negative bacteria, and archaea, suggesting the presence of the gene for this protein in the common ancestor of bacteria and archaea. the absence of the orf35 gene in mycobacterium tuberculosis and other gram-positive bacteria indicates that the loss of this gene must have occurred in an ancestor of other gram-positive bacteria following their divergence from the ancestor of bacillus/clostridium/staphylococcus lineage.

TI  == catabolism of branched-chain alpha-keto acids in enterococcus faecalis: the bkd gene cluster, enzymes, and metabolic route.
AB  == genes encoding a branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase from enterococcus faecalis 10c1, e1alpha (bkda), e1beta (bkdb), e2 (bkdc), and e3 (bkdd), were found to reside in the gene cluster ptb-buk-bkddabc. the predicted products of ptb and buk exhibited significant homology to the phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase, respectively, from clostridium acetobutylicum. activity and redox properties of the purified recombinant enzyme encoded by bkdd indicate that e. faecalis has a lipoamide dehydrogenase that is distinct from the lipoamide dehydrogenase associated with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. specific activity of the ptb gene product expressed in escherichia coli was highest with the substrates valeryl-coenzyme a (coa), isovaleryl-coa, and isobutyryl-coa. in cultures, a stoichiometric conversion of alpha-ketoisocaproate to isovalerate was observed, with a concomitant increase in biomass. we propose that alpha-ketoisocaproate is converted via the bkdh complex to isovaleryl-coa and subsequently converted into isovalerate via the combined actions of the ptb and buk gene products with the concomitant phosphorylation of adp. in contrast, an e. faecalis bkd mutant constructed by disruption of the bkda gene did not benefit from having alpha-ketoisocaproate in the growth medium, and conversion to isovalerate was less than 2% of the wild-type conversion. it is concluded that the bkd gene cluster encodes the enzymes that constitute a catabolic pathway for  branched-chain alpha-keto acids that was previously unidentified in e. faecalis.

TI  == the s box regulon: a new global transcription termination control system for methionine and cysteine biosynthesis genes in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the molecular mechanisms for regulation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine are poorly characterized in bacillus subtilis. analyses of the recently completed b. subtilis genome revealed 11 copies of a highly conserved motif. in all cases, this motif was located in the leader region of putative transcriptional units, upstream of coding sequences that included genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis. additional copies were identified in clostridium acetobutylicum and staphylococcus aureus, indicating conservation in other gram-positive genera. the motif includes an element resembling an intrinsic transcriptional terminator, suggesting that regulation might be controlled at the level of premature termination of transcription. the 5' portion of all of the leaders could fold into a conserved complex structure. analysis of the yitj gene, which is homologous to escherichia coli meth and metf, revealed that expression was induced by starvation for methionine and that induction was independent of the promoter and dependent on the leader region terminator. mutation of conserved primary sequence and structural elements supported a model in which the 5' portion of the leader forms an anti-antiterminator structure, which sequesters sequences required for the formation of an antiterminator, which, in turn, sequesters sequences required for the formation of the terminator; the anti-antiterminator is postulated to be stabilized by the binding of some unknown factor when methionine is available. this set of genes is proposed to form a new regulon controlled by a global termination control system, which we designate the s box system, as most of the genes are involved in sulphur metabolism and biosynthesis of methionine and cysteine.

TI  == the hyperthermophilic bacterium thermotoga maritima has two different classes of  family c dna polymerases: evolutionary implications.
AB  == bacterial dna polymerase iii (family c dna polymerase), the principal chromosomal replicative enzyme, is known to occur in at least three distinct forms which have provisionally been classified as class i ( escherichia coli dna pol c-type), class ii ( bacillus subtilis dna pol c-type) and class iii (cyanobacteria dna pol c-type). we have identified two family c dna polymerase sequences in the hyperthermophilic bacterium thermotoga maritima. one dna polymerase consisting of 842 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of 97 213 belongs to class  i. the other one, consisting of 1367 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of 155 361, is a member of class ii. comparative sequence analyses suggest that the class ii dna polymerase is the principal dna replicative enzyme of the microbe and that the class i dna polymerase may be functionally inactive. a phylogenetic analysis using the class ii enzyme indicates that t.maritima is closely related to the low g+c gram-positive bacteria, in particular to clostridium acetobutylicum, and mycoplasmas. these results are in conflict with 16s rrna-based phylogenies, which placed t.maritima as one of the deepest branches of the bacterial tree.

TI  == cloning of an ef-p homologue from bacteroides fragilis that increases b. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == investigations of possible regulators of bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) activity were done in escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. the b. fragilis glna gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 and expressed in the e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion strain, ymc11. gs activity was monitored following co-transformation with a b. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pecor251. a gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in b. fragilis gs activity but did not affect the activity of the e. coli gs enzyme or the b. fragilis sucrase (scrl). deletion of the b. fragilis glna downstream region decreased basal levels of gs activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the b. fragilis gs activity. reporter gene analysis, using the b. fragilis glna promoter region fused to the promoterless clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. this demonstrated that the increase in gs  activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. sequence data  indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor p (ef-p) proteins, the highest being to that of a synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to mycobacterium genitalium (27%). amino acid identity to the e. coli ef-p was intermediate (37%). a possible role for ef-p in enhancing translation of the b. fragilis glna mrna is proposed.

TI  == expression of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 genes in escherichia coli for acetone production and acetate detoxification.
AB  == a synthetic acetone operon (ace4) composed of four clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 genes (adc, ctfab, and thl, coding for the acetoacetate decarboxylase, coenzyme a transferase, and thiolase, respectively) under the control of the thl  promoter was constructed and was introduced into escherichia coli on vector pact. acetone production demonstrated that ace4 is expressed in e. coli and resulted in the reduction of acetic acid levels in the fermentation broth. since different e. coli strains vary significantly in their growth characteristics and acetate metabolism, ace4 was expressed in three e. coli strains: er2275, atcc 11303, and  mc1060. shake flask cultures of mc1060(pact) produced ca. 2 mm acetone, while both strains er2275(pact) and atcc 11303(pact) produced ca. 40 mm acetone. glucose-fed cultures of strain atcc 11303(pact) resulted in a 150% increase in acetone titers compared to those of batch shake flask cultures. external addition of sodium acetate to glucose-fed cultures of atcc 11303(pact) resulted in further increased acetone titers. in bioreactor studies, acidic conditions (ph 5.5 versus 6.5) improved acetone production. despite the substantial acetone evaporation due to aeration and agitation in the bioreactor, 125 to 154 mm acetone accumulated in atcc 11303(pact) fermentations. these acetone titers are equal to or higher than  those produced by wild-type c. acetobutylicum. this is the first study to demonstrate the ability to use clostridial genes in nonclostridial hosts for solvent production. in addition, acetone-producing e. coli strains may be useful  hosts for recombinant protein production in that detrimental acetate accumulation can be avoided.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of dnak-operon proteins from the thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus.
AB  == we propose that the dnak operon of thermus thermophilus hb8 is composed of three  functionally linked genes: dnak, grpe, and dnaj. the dnak and dnaj gene products  are most closely related to their cyanobacterial homologs. the dnak protein sequence places t. thermophilus in the plastid hsp70 subfamily. in contrast, the  grpe translated sequence is most similar to grpe from clostridium acetobutylicum, a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium. a single promoter region, with homology to the escherichia coli consensus promoter sequences recognized by the sigma70 and sigma32 transcription factors, precedes the postulated operon. this promoter is heat-shock inducible. the dnak mrna level increased more than 30 times upon 10 min of heat shock (from 70 degrees c to 85 degrees c). a strong transcription terminating sequence was found between the dnak and grpe genes. the individual genes were cloned into pet expression vectors and the thermophilic proteins were  overproduced at high levels in e. coli and purified to homogeneity. the recombinant t. thermophilus dnak protein was shown to have a weak atp-hydrolytic  activity, with an optimum at 90 degrees c. the atpase was stimulated by the presence of grpe and dnaj. another open reading frame, coding for clpb heat-shock protein, was found downstream of the dnak operon.

TI  == the kdp system of clostridium acetobutylicum: cloning, sequencing, and transcriptional regulation in response to potassium concentration.
AB  == the complete sequence of the kdp gene region of clostridium acetobutylicum has been determined. this part of the chromosome comprises two small open reading frames (orfz and orfy), putatively encoding hydrophobic peptides, and the genes kdpa, kdpb, kdpc, and kdpx, followed by an operon encoding a pair of sensor-effector regulatory proteins (kdpd and kdpe). except for orfz, orfy, and kdpx, all genes showed significant homology to the kdp genes of escherichia coli, encoding a high-affinity potassium transport atpase and its regulators. the complete genome sequence of synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803 and a recently published part of the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome indicate the existence of a kdp system in these organisms as well, but all three systems comprise neither a second orf upstream of kdpa nor an additional kdpx gene. expression of the clostridial kdp genes, including the unique kdpx gene, was found to be inducible  by low potassium concentrations. a transcription start point could be mapped upstream of orfz. a promoter upstream of kdpd was active only under noninducing conditions. lowering the potassium content of the medium led to formation of a common transcript (orfzykdpabcxde), with a putative internal rnase e recognition  site, which could be responsible for the instability of the common transcript. except for the two small peptides, all gene products could be detected in in vitro transcription-translation experiments.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

AB  == the enzymes phosphotransacetylase (pta) and acetate kinase (ak) catalyze the conversion of acetyl coenzyme a to acetate in the fermentation of clostridium acetobutylicum. the acetate-producing step is an important element in the acidogenic fermentation stage and generates atp for clostridial cell growth. the  genes pta and ack, encoding pta and ak, respectively, were cloned and sequenced.  enzyme activity assays were performed on cell extracts from escherichia coli and  c. acetobutylicum harboring the subclone, and both ak and pta activities were shown to be elevated. dna sequence analysis showed that the pta and ack genes are adjacent in the clostridial chromosome, with pta upstream. the pta gene encodes a protein of 333 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 36.2 kda,  and ack encodes a polypeptide of 401 residues with a molecular mass of 44.3 kda.  primer extension analysis identified a single transcriptional start site located  70 bp upstream of the start codon for the pta gene, suggesting an operon arrangement for these tandem genes. the results from overexpression of ack and pta in c. acetobutylicum showed that the final ratios of acetate to other major products were higher and that there was a greater proportion of two- versus four-carbon-derived products.

TI  == the effect of novobiocin on solvent production by clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == cells of clostridium acetobutylicum treated with novoblocin, a dna gyrase inhibitor, produced higher butyrate levels and lower solvent levels with acetone  being the most affected. seven enzyme activities involved in acid and solvent production were analyzed. among them, only coa transferase, required for acetone  formation and acid uptake, experienced a significant decrease in activity. as in  escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, dna from c. acetobutylicum became less negatively supercoiled in the early stationary phase (solventogenic stage), as shown by analysis of linking number of a reporter plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of chloroquine.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of clustered genes encoding beta-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme a (coa) dehydrogenase, crotonase, and butyryl-coa dehydrogenase from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824.
AB  == the enzymes beta-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme a (coa) dehydrogenase (bhbd), crotonase, and butyryl-coa dehydrogenase (bcd) from clostridium acetobutylicum are responsible for the formation of butyryl-coa from acetoacetyl-coa. these enzymes  are essential to both acid formation and solvent formation by clostridia. clustered genes encoding bhbd, crotonase, bcd, and putative electron transfer flavoprotein alpha and beta subunits have been cloned and sequenced. the nucleotide sequence of the crt gene indicates that it encodes crotonase, a protein with 261 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 28.2 kda; the hbd gene encodes bhbd, with 282 residues and a molecular mass of 30.5 kda. three open reading frames (bcd, etfb, and etfa) are located between crt and hbd.  the nucleotide sequence of bcd indicates that it encodes bcd, which consists of 379 amino acid residues and has high levels of homology with various acyl-coa dehydrogenases. open reading frames etfb and etfa, located downstream of bcd, encode 27.2- and 36.1-kda proteins, respectively, and show homology with the fixab genes and the alpha and beta subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein. these findings suggest that bcd in clostridia might interact with the electron transfer flavoprotein in its redox function. primer extension analysis identified a promoter consensus sequence upstream of the crt gene, suggesting that the clustered genes are transcribed as a transcriptional unit and form a bcs (butyryl-coa synthesis) operon. a dna fragment containing the entire bcs operon was subcloned into an escherichia coli-c. acetobutylicum shuttle vector. enzyme activity assays showed that crotonase and bhbd were highly overproduced in cell extracts from e. coli harboring the subclone. in c. acetobutylicum harboring the subclone, the activities of the enzymes crotonase, bhbd, and bcd were elevated.

TI  == recombination-induced variants of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 with increased solvent production.
AB  == three sporulation-specific genes (orfa, sige, sigg) from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 are arranged in a cluster, encoding the putative sigma e-processing enzyme, sigma e, and sigma sigma g respectively. when they were transformed into clostridium acetobutylicum while on a plasmid functional in this organism, transformants did not survive. three kinds of recombinations were then  attempted with nonreplicative plasmids: duplication of orfa and sige, replacement of all of the three genes, and inactivation of orfa. while the wild-type strain ceased to grow and produce solvents in batch cultures after approximately 24 h, mutant strains were isolated that showed sustained growth for a much longer time  and produced a threefold increase in acetone and butanol in test tube cultures. in addition, one of the derived strains showed a significantly higher growth rate. features of the restriction maps of the recombinants did not correlate with expected maps, indicating possible complications occurring during the recombination events.

TI  == chemotherapeutic tumour targeting using clostridial spores.
AB  == the toxicity associated with conventional cancer chemotherapy is primarily due to a lack of specificity for tumour cells. in contrast, intravenously injected clostridial spores exhibit a remarkable specificity for tumours. this is because, following their administration, clostridial spores become exclusively localised to, and germinate in, the hypoxic/necrotic tissue of tumours. this unique property could be exploited to deliver therapeutic agents to tumours. in particular, genetic engineering could be used to endow a suitable clostridial host with the capacity to produce an enzyme within the tumour which can metabolise a systemically introduced, non-toxic prodrug into a toxic metabolite.  the feasibility of this strategy (clostridial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy, cdept) has been demonstrated by cloning the escherichia coli b gene encoding nitroreductase (an enzyme which converts the prodrug cb1954 to a highly toxic bifunctional alkylating agent) into a clostridial expression vector and introducing the resultant plasmid into clostridium beijerinckii (formerly c. acetobutylicum) ncimb 8052. the gene was efficiently expressed, with recombinant  nitroreductase representing 8% of the cell soluble protein. following the intravenous injection of the recombinant spores into mice, tumour lysates have been shown, by western blots, to contain the e. coli-derived enzyme.

TI  == expression of heat shock genes in clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == characterization of the heat shock response in clostridium acetobutylicum has indicated that at least 15 proteins are induced by a temperature upshift from 30  to 42 degrees c. these so-called heat shock proteins include dnak and groel, two  highly conserved molecular chaperones. several genes encoding heat shock proteins of c. acetobutylicum have been cloned and analysed. the dnak operon includes the  genes orfa (a heat shock gene with an unknown function), grpe, dnak, and dnaj; and the groe operon the genes groes and groel. the hsp18 gene coding for a member of the small heat shock protein family constitutes a monocistronic operon. interestingly, the heat shock response in this bacterium is regulated by a mechanism, which is obviously different from that found in escherichia coli. so far, no evidence for a heat shock-specific sigma factor of the rna polymerase in  c. acetobutylicum has been found. in this bacterium, like in many gram-positive and several gram-negative bacteria, a conserved inverted repeat is located upstream of chaperone/chaperonin-encoding stress genes such as dnak and groel and may be implicated as a cis-acting regulatory site. the inverted repeat is not present in the promoter region of hsp18. therefore, in c. acetobutylicum there are at least two classes of heat shock genes with respect to the type of regulation. evidence has been found that a repressor is involved in the regulation of the heat shock response in c. acetobutylicum. however, this regulation seems to be independent of the inverted repeat motif, and the mechanism by which the inverted repeat motif mediates regulation remains to be elucidated.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == taxonomy and phylogeny of industrial solvent-producing clostridia.
AB  == we performed a systematic study of 55 solvent-producing clostridial strains, the  majority of which are currently classified as clostridium acetobutylicum strains, by using a combination of biotyping and dna fingerprint analysis. the biotyping procedures used included rifampin susceptibility testing, bacteriocin typing, and bacteriophage typing. the 55 strains examined exhibited a good correlation between their biotypes and dna fingerprints, which allowed us to divide them into nine groups. the dna fingerprints of the nine groups differed markedly, but within each group the dna fingerprints exhibited a high level of similarity. to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the nine groups, we performed a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the results of a comparative analysis of the partial sequence corresponding to positions 830 to 1383 (escherichia coli numbering) of the 16s rrna gene indicated that the nine biotype groups could be assembled into  four taxonomic groups. the complete 16s rrna sequences of strains representing these groups were determined. our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the amylolytic type strain c. acetobutylicum atcc 824 (taxonomic group i) was only distantly related to the saccharolytic strains belonging to taxonomic groups ii,  iii, and iv (levels of sequence similarity, 90 to 90.5%). the strains belonging to taxonomic groups ii, iii, and iv, represented by c. acetobutylicum ncp 262, "clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum" n1-4, and c. acetobutylicum ncimb 8052t  (t = type strain), respectively, were closely related (levels of sequence similarity, 98.2 to 98.9%). c. acetobutylicum ncimb 8052t exhibited a level of similarity of 100% with the type strain of clostridium beijerinckii. reclassification of the saccharolytic solvent-producing strains is necessary, and possible names for the four taxonomic groups are discussed.

AB  == plasmid pmet7c containing a 6.05 kb dna insert from clostridium acetobutylicum p262 made escherichia coli f19 cells sensitive to metronidazole. the nucleotide sequence of the c. acetobutylicum dna controlling metronidazole sensitivity in e. coli f19 revealed an orf of 972 bp which encoded a protein of 324 amino acids with a calculated mr of 35,000. the amino acid sequence encoded by the orf contained a helix-turn-helix dna-binding domain and was homologous to the catabolite control protein, ccpa, from bacillus subtilis and bacillus megaterium, a trna repressor of e. coli encoded by the shl gene, and the galr, lacl and purr  repressors of e. coli. the c. acetobutylicum orf, which was termed rega, complemented a b. subtilis ccpa mutant and an e. coli shl mutant, but was unable  to complement e. coli galr, lacl or purr mutants. to determine whether the rega gene product was involved in the regulation of amylase gene expression in c. acetobutylicum, a starch-degrading enzyme gene (staa) from c. acetobutylicum ncimb 8052 was cloned. the rega protein inhibited the degradation of starch by the c. acetobutylicum staa gene product in e. coli.

TI  == tracking the evolution of the bacterial choline-binding domain: molecular characterization of the clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052 cspa gene.
AB  == the major secreted protein of clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052, a choline-containing strain, is cspa (clostridial secreted protein). it appears to  be a 115,000-m(r) glycoprotein that specifically recognizes the choline residues  of the cell wall. polyclonal antibodies raised against cspa detected the presence of the protein in the cell envelope and in the culture medium. the soluble cspa protein has been purified, and an oligonucleotide probe, prepared from the determined n-terminal sequence, has been used to clone the cspa gene which encodes a protein with 590 amino acids and an m(r) of 63,740. according to the predicted amino acid sequence, cspa is synthesized with an n-terminal segment of  26 amino acids characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. expression of the cspa gene in escherichia coli led to the production of a major anti-cspa-labeled  protein of 80,000 da which was purified by affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose. a comparison of cspa with other proteins in the embl database revealed that the c-terminal half of cspa is homologous to the choline-binding domains of the major pneumococcal autolysin (lyta amidase), the pneumococcal antigen pspa, and other cell wall-lytic enzymes of pneumococcal phages. this region, which is constructed of four repeating motifs, also displays a high similarity with the glucan-binding domains of several streptococcal glycosyltransferases and the toxins of clostridium difficile.

AB  == an endoglucanase gene, which was shown to be identical to the previously sequenced engb gene [attwood et al. (1993) abstr. ann. meet. am. soc. microbiol.], was isolated from a clostridium cellulovorans genomic library. because of the lack of transcriptional information concerning engb we examined its expression in c. cellulovorans and in the heterologous hosts escherichia coli and c. acetobutylicum following transformation of engb. northern analysis suggested that both e. coli and c. acetobutylicum produced several transcripts of various sizes. c. cellulovarans produced a single transcript of 1600 bp with the  relative amount of engb mrna from cellulose-grown cells being much greater than that from cellobiose-grown cells. primer extensions showed that engb was transcribed from a single transcription initiation site in c. cellulovorans preceded by sequences similar to promoter sequences found in gram-positive bacteria. primer extensions from both e. coli and c. acetobutylicum strains containing the engb gene showed multiple transcription initiation sites, none of  which corresponded to the site determined in c. cellulovorans. we conclude that transcriptional control of the engb gene is less stringent in heterologous backgrounds and postulate that expression of the engb gene in c. cellulovorans is increased in the presence of cellulose.

TI  == identification of a grpe heat-shock gene homolog in the archaeon methanosarcina mazei.
AB  == a grpe heat-shock gene was found by sequencing in the genome of the methanogenic  archaeon methanosarcina mazei s-6. it is the first example of grpe from the phylogenetic domain archaea. since the other seven sequenced homologs are from the domain bacteria, it may be concluded that grpe appeared early in evolution, before the two domains separated. the archaeal grpe is located in the dnak locus, 431 base-pairs upstream of dnak, which is followed downstream by the dnaj gene. the organization of these three genes is known for bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, borrelia burgdorferi and mycobacterium tuberculosis. the archaeal locus organization, grpe-dnak-dnaj, is similar to that of the former three bacteria, but different from that of m. tuberculosis. this, and sequence homologies, suggest that the m. tuberculosis grpe belongs, together with the streptomyces coelicolor homolog, to a subgroup of the grpe proteins. the m. mazei grpe gene encodes a protein of 209 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence shows 28.2 to 34.6% identities, and 50.3 to 58.9 similarities (identities plus conservative substitutions) with the other six complete grpe sequences available. these percentages fall within the range observed for the other grpes. two regions in the second and fourth quarters of the grpe molecule show higher homology, particularly in three stretches of nine, six and nine amino acid residues, respectively. the archaeal gene uses all codons but three, whereas the bacterial homologs lack higher numbers of codons. the m. mazei grpe responded to heat-shock by increasing transcription, in a manner similar to that of the nearby heat-shock gene dnak.

TI  == molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  == there is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. they display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. they can be divided into three  major categories. (1) the nad- or nadp-dependent dehydrogenases. these can in turn be divided into the group i long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases i, ii, and iii of saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of pseudomonas putida; the group ii short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of klebsiella aerogenes; the group iii "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase ii of zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase iv of saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900  residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of escherichia coli and clostridium acetobutylicum. the aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of a. methanolica and mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-n,n-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) nad(p)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor f420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of acetobacter and gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) oxidases that catalyze  an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi  involved in lignin degradation. this review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. the discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. the physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.

AB  == a 5.4 kb hindiii fragment of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was identified using a homologous dnak probe generated by pcr and cloned in escherichia coli. upstream sequences were generated by inverse pcr. the two cloned fragments partially overlapped, and sequencing of 5915 bp revealed the presence of four open reading frames in the order orf1-grpe-dnak-orf4. orf1 encodes a 39 kda protein of unknown function which shows considerable sequence homology with the orf39 and orfa proteins of bacillus subtilis and clostridium acetobutylicum, respectively. the downstream orfs showed high homology to the grpe and dnak genes of other prokaryotes. the dnak protein has a characteristic 24-amino-acid deletion exhibited by all the known dnak proteins of gram-positive species. in many bacteria the dnak and dnaj genes are found as part of the same operon. the l. lactis dnak operon is unusual in that the dnak gene is followed by a putative  transcription terminator and a fourth large orf which shares no homology with the dnaj genes of other bacteria but has a small degree of homology with various membrane proteins. vegetative promoter sequences are found upstream of both orf1  and orf4. a 12 bp inverted repeat is found upstream of the putative promoter of orf1 and an 8 bp inverted repeat is found between this promoter and the orf1 initiation codon. these repeats are thought to be involved in regulation of the heat-shock genes. the dnak homologue is induced approximately 3-fold on heat shock at 42 degrees c.

TI  == cloning, nucleotide sequence and structural analysis of the clostridium acetobutylicum dnaj gene.
AB  == the complete dnaj gene of clostridium acetobutylicum was isolated by chromosome walking using the previously cloned 5' end of the gene as a probe. nucleotide sequencing of a positively reacting 2.2-kb hincii fragment, contained in the recombinant plasmid pkg4, revealed that the reading frame of the dnaj gene of c.  acetobutylicum consists of 1125 bp, encoding a protein of 374 amino acids with a  calculated m(r) of 40376 and an isoelectric point of 9.54. the deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to the dnaj proteins of other bacteria (e.g. escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis) as well as of an archaeon (methanosarcina mazei) and to the corresponding proteins of eukaryotes (saccharomyces cerevisiae, homo sapiens). the areas of similarity included a conserved n-terminal domain of  about 70 amino acids, a glycine-rich region of about 30 residues, and a central domain containing four repeats of a cxxcxgxg motif, whereas the c-terminal domain was less conserved. northern (rna) blot analysis indicated that dnaj is induced by heat shock and that it is part of the dnak operon of c. acetobutylicum. the 5' end (901 bp) of another gene (orfb), downstream of dnaj and not heat-inducible, showed no significant similarity to other sequences available in embl and genbank databases.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and molecular analysis of the sol operon of clostridium acetobutylicum, a chromosomal locus involved in solventogenesis.
AB  == a dna region of clostridium acetobutylicum contiguous with the adc operon has been cloned and sequenced. structural genes encoding the acetoacetyl coenzyme a:acetate/butyrate:coenzyme a transferase (ctfb and ctfa) and an alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhe) could be identified. these three genes together with a small open reading frame (orf) of unknown function (upstream of adhe) formed an operon  (sol operon), as shown by mrna analyses. the complete sol operon was transcriptionally induced or derepressed before the onset of solventogenesis, thus confirming earlier results of northern hybridizations with a ctfb gene probe (u. gerischer and p. durre, j. bacteriol. 174:426-433, 1992). upstream of the sol operon, we identified two putative promoters that were located in regions with possible stem-loop structures formed by several inverted repeats. the distal promoter p1 showed only minor transcription initiation in solventogenic c. acetobutylicum cells but was recognized in escherichia coli, presumably because of its high similarity to the sigma 70 consensus sequence. the adhe-proximal promoter p2 directed the major transcription start point in solventogenic c. acetobutylicum but was not recognized in e. coli. the clostridial adhe showed high similarity to a novel family (type iii) of alcohol dehydrogenases. two other orfs (orf 5 and orf 6) were found on the cloned dna region that showed no significant similarity to sequences in various available data bases. mrna studies revealed that orf 5 formed a monocistronic operon and showed increased expression before onset of solventogenesis.

AB  == a bacteriophage-plasmid hybrid (phagemid) designated pcak1 was constructed by ligating 5-kbp escherichia coli plasmid pak102 (apremr) and the 6.6-kbp haeiii-linearized replicative form of the cak1 viruslike particle from clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 6444. phagemid pcak1 (11.6 kbp) replicated via the cole1 replication origin derived from pak102 in e. coli. single-stranded dna  (ssdna) molecules complexed with protein in a manner which protected ssdna from nucleases were recovered from the supernatant of e. coli dh11s transformants containing pcak1 in the absence of cell lysis. this suggests that the viral-strand dna synthesis replication origin of cak1 and associated gene expression are functional in e. coli dh11s. the single-stranded form of pcak1 isolated from e. coli supernatant was transformed into e. coli dh5 alpha' or dh11s by electroporation. isolation of ampicillin-resistant e. coli transformants following transformation suggests that the complementary-strand dna synthesis replication origin of cak1 is also functional in e. coli. the coat proteins associated with ssdna of pcak1 demonstrated sensitivity to proteinase k and various solvents (i.e., phenol and chloroform), similar to the results obtained previously with cak1. following phagemid construction in e. coli, pcak1 was transformed into c. acetobutylicum atcc 824 and c. perfringens 13 by intact cell  electroporation. restriction enzyme analysis of pcak1 isolated from erythromycin-resistant transformants of both c. acetobutylicum and c. perfringens suggested that it was identical to that present in e. coli transformants.

AB  == a dna region of clostridium acetobutylicum containing a gene (hsp 18) with significant homology to a family of small eukaryotic heat shock proteins was cloned and sequenced. it is the second reported sequence of a low-molecular-weight heat shock protein from gram-positive bacteria and is induced not only by heat shock but also at the onset of solventogenesis, as determined by northern (rna) blot analysis, thus confirming the results of an earlier study performed at the protein level (a. pich, f. narberhaus, and h. bahl, appl. microbiol. biotechnol. 33:697-704, 1990). by primer extension analysis, a transcriptional start site was identified 149 bp upstream of hsp18. this site was preceded by a region that exhibits high homology to the consensus promoter sequences of gram-positive bacteria, as well as sigma 70-dependent escherichia coli. a direct repeat structure was detected in the -35 region. the promoter is located 196 bp from the start of a potential regulatory trna(thr)acg  gene involved in the shift to solventogenesis which is transcribed in the opposite direction. a putative rho-independent transcription termination structure was identified at the 3' end of hsp18.

TI  == in vivo methylation in escherichia coli by the bacillus subtilis phage phi 3t i methyltransferase to protect plasmids from restriction upon transformation of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824.
AB  == the restriction endonuclease cac824i has been shown to be a major barrier to electrotransformation of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 (l. d. mermelstein,  n. e. welker, g. n. bennett, and e. t. papoutsakis, bio/technology 10:190-195, 1992). methylation by the phi 3t i methyltransferase encoded by bacillus subtilis phage phi 3t was shown to protect plasmid dna from restriction by cac824i. expression in escherichia coli of the phi 3ti gene (which encodes the phi 3t i methyltransferase) from pan1, which replicates via the p15a origin of replication, was sufficient to completely methylate coresident e. coli-c. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors with cole1 origins of replication. three shuttle vectors (pimp1, psyl2, and psyl7) methylated in this manner were used to efficiently electrotransform strain atcc 824. these vectors could not be introduced into strain atcc 824 when unmethylated because the e. coli portions of the plasmids contain a large number of cac824i sites. this method obviates the need to use b. subtilis-c. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors with few cac824i sites  to introduce dna into c. acetobutylicum atcc 824.

TI  == cloning, nucleotide sequence, and regulatory analysis of the lactococcus lactis dnaj gene.
AB  == the dnaj gene of lactococcus lactis was isolated from a genomic library of l. lactis nizo r5 and cloned into puc19. nucleotide sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,137 bp in length, encoding a protein of 379 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to the dnaj proteins of escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the level of the dnaj monocistronic mrna increased approximately  threefold after heat shock. the transcription initiation site of the dnaj gene was determined and appeared to be preceded by a typical gram-positive vegetative  promoter sequence (ttgcca-17 bp-taaaat). upstream of the promoter region, an inverted repeat is located that is identical to those detected upstream of heat shock genes of other gram-positive organisms. a transcriptional fusion between the dnaj expression signals and a usp45-amys secretion cassette caused a significant increase in alpha-amylase activity after heat shock induction. deletion mutagenesis showed that the inverted repeat is involved in heat shock regulation of the dnaj gene. the conservation of this palindromic sequence in gram-positive heat shock genes suggests a common regulatory pathway distinct from the system used in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a reporter gene vector to investigate the regulation of glutamine synthetase in bacteroides fragilis bf1.
AB  == the clostridium acetobutylicum egla gene, encoding a beta-1,4-endoglucanase (eg), was shown to be a useful reporter gene for the study of gene expression in bacteroides fragilis. the egla reporter gene has the advantages that it can be easily identified in both escherichia coli and b. fragilis on agar media containing carboxymethylcellulose, and eg production can be rapidly quantified in liquid medium. since the b. fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) is inactivated in  permeabilized cells and cell extracts, the egla reporter gene was used to study the regulation of gs production in b. fragilis. gene fusions containing the gs glna promoter region fused to the promoterless egla gene showed that glna expression was regulated by nitrogen in b. fragilis at the transcriptional level. a glna upstream region containing a near-perfect direct repeat sequence was essential for efficient gs expression and for regulation by nitrogen.

TI  == differential expression of a clostridium acetobutylicum antisense rna: implications for regulation of glutamine synthetase.
AB  == the clostridium acetobutylicum glutamine synthetase (gs) dna region is characterized by a downstream promoter, p3, oriented toward the glna gene, which  controls the transcription of an rna complementary to the start of the glna mrna. expression of the predicted 43-base antisense rna was demonstrated in c. acetobutylicum and escherichia coli cells containing the cloned glna dna. antisense rna transcription from p3 was not regulated by nitrogen in e. coli cells, but the expression of antisense rna was associated with decreased levels of gs activity. in c. acetobutylicum, gs activity and the transcription of glna mrna and antisense rna were regulated by nitrogen. gs activity and glna mrna were repressed in cells grown in nitrogen-rich medium. repression ratios for gs activity varied from 1.6 to 9.0, depending on the sampling time. the relative number of glna transcripts was approximately 25% lower in cells grown for 72 h in nitrogen-rich medium than in cells grown in nitrogen-limiting medium. this finding contrasted with the expression of antisense rna, which was repressed in nitrogen-limiting medium but induced in nitrogen-rich medium. the relative number of antisense rna transcripts was increased approximately sixfold in cells grown in nitrogen-rich medium. there was a 1.6-fold excess of antisense rna over glna mrna under conditions that repressed gs activity. under conditions that induced gs activity, glna mrna transcripts exceeded antisense rna transcripts by fivefold.

AB  == thiolase (acetyl coenzyme a acetyltransferase; ec 2.3.1.9) from clostridium acetobutylicum is a key enzyme in the production of acids and solvents in this organism. the purification and properties of the enzyme have already been described (d. p. wiesenborn, f. b. rudolph, and e.t. papoutsakis, appl. environ.  microbiol. 54:2717-2722, 1988). the thl gene encoding the thiolase has been cloned by using primary antibodies raised to the purified enzyme. a bacteriophage lambda embl3 library of c. acetobutylicum dna was prepared and screened by immunoblots with the antithiolase antibodies. phage dna was purified from positive plaques, and restriction enzyme digests identified an approximately 4.8-kb acci fragment common to all positive plaques. a corresponding fragment was also found in acci digests of c. acetobutylicum chromosomal dna. the fragment was purified and ecori linkers were attached before being subcloned into puc19. maxicell analysis showed the production of an approximately 42-kda protein, whose size corresponded to the molecular size of the purified thiolase, from the clostridial insert. enzyme activity assays and western blot (immunoblot) analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated whole-cell extracts of escherichia coli harboring the cloned thl confirmed the presence of the thiolase encoded within the cloned dna.

TI  == expression and nucleotide sequence of the clostridium acetobutylicum beta-galactosidase gene cloned in escherichia coli.
AB  == a gene library for clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 2951 was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid plafr1, and cosmids containing the beta-galactosidase gene were isolated by direct selection for enzyme activity on x-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactoside) plates after conjugal transfer of the library to a lac deletion derivative of escherichia coli. analysis of various psup202 subclones of the lac cosmids on x-gal plates localized the beta-galactosidase gene to a 5.1-kb ecori fragment. expression of the clostridium beta-galactosidase gene in e. coli was not subject to glucose repression. by using transposon tn5 mutagenesis, two gene loci, cbga (locus i) and cbgr (locus ii), were identified as necessary for beta-galactosidase expression in e. coli. dna sequence analysis of the entire 5.1-kb fragment identified open reading frames of 2,691 and 303 bp, corresponding to locus i and locus ii, respectively,  and in addition a third truncated open reading frame of 825 bp. the predicted gene product of locus i, cbga (molecular size, 105 kda), showed extensive amino acid sequence homology with e. coli lacz, e. coli ebga, and klebsiella pneumoniae lacz and was in agreement with the size of a polypeptide synthesized in maxicells containing the cloned 5.1-kb fragment. the predicted gene product of locus ii, cbgr (molecular size, 11 kda) shares no significant homology with any other sequence in the current dna and protein sequence data bases, but tn5 insertions in this gene prevent the synthesis of cbga. complementation experiments indicate  that the gene product of cbgr is required in cis with cbga for expression of beta-galactosidase in e. coli.

TI  == molecular cloning of an alcohol (butanol) dehydrogenase gene cluster from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824.
AB  == in clostridium acetobutylicum, conversion of butyraldehyde to butanol is enzymatically achieved by butanol dehydrogenase (bdh). a c. acetobutylicum gene that encodes this protein was identified by using an oligonucleotide designed on  the basis of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of purified c. acetobutylicum nadh-dependent bdh. enzyme assays of cell extracts of escherichia coli harboring  the clostridial gene demonstrated 15-fold-higher nadh-dependent bdh activity than untransformed e. coli, as well as an additional nadph-dependent bdh activity. kinetic, sequence, and isoelectric focusing analyses suggest that the cloned clostridial dna contains two or more distinct c. acetobutylicum enzymes with bdh  activity.

AB  == the dna-dependent rna polymerase (ec 2.7.7.6) from clostridium acetobutylicum dsm 1731 has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. the purified enzyme was  composed of four subunits and had a molecular mass of 370,000 da. western immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against the sigma 70 subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase identified the 46,000-da subunit as an immunologically and probably functionally related protein. the other three subunits of 128,000, 117,000, and 42,000 da are tentatively analogous to the beta, beta', and alpha subunits, respectively, of other eubacterial rna polymerases. the rna polymerase activity was completely dependent on mg2+, nucleoside triphosphates, and a dna template. the presence of mg2+ or mn2+ in buffers used for purification or storage caused irreversible inactivation of the  rna polymerase.

TI  == electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1.
AB  == methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. the rectangular views can  be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. it is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. the estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. the enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from saccharomyces cerevisiae, zymomonas mobilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, and escherichia coli,  which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. in view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (ec 1.1.1.1) by using the name nad-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.

TI  == metronidazole activation and isolation of clostridium acetobutylicum electron transport genes.

AB  == a single-stranded 6.6-kb dna molecule complexed with protein was recovered from the supernatant of clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 6444. electron microscopic examination of the dna-protein complex revealed the presence of a filamentous viruslike particle, which was designated cak1. the possible double-stranded plasmidlike replicative form and the single-stranded prophage were also recovered from the cell culture following alkaline lysis. cak1 was released from the c. acetobutylicum cell culture in the absence of cell lysis. polyethylene glycol-nacl coprecipitation of the dna-protein complex revealed the presence of single-stranded dna complexed with protein in a manner rendering the dna resistant to bal 31 exonuclease. proteinase treatment of cscl density gradient-purified cak1 resulted in recovery of dnase-sensitive single-stranded dna. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cak1 demonstrated the presence of a 5-kda major coat protein. hybridization data indicated that the single-stranded dna from cak1 has homology with the m13 phage  of escherichia coli. an examination of various physical properties of cak1 suggests that it is similar to the filamentous phage recovered from gram-negative microorganisms. although infectivity or inducibility of cak1 could not be demonstrated, to our knowledge this represents the first report of a nonlytic filamentous viruslike particle containing single-stranded dna being recovered from a gram-positive bacterium.

TI  == natural transfer of conjugative transposon tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the conjugative streptococcal transposon tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for alcaligenes eutrophus, citrobacter freundii, and escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). no transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. mating of an e. coli strain carrying tn916 yielded transconjugants with bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. the results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially  contributing to bacterial evolution.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and molecular analysis of the acetoacetate decarboxylase gene region from clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc) (ec4.1.1.4) of clostridium acetobutylicum dsm 792 was purified to homogeneity, and its first 25 n-terminal amino acids were determined. oligonucleotide probes deduced from this sequence were used to detect positive clones in partial gene banks derived from sau3a and haeiii digests with  following ligation into the vector puc9. in escherichia coli, the 2.1-kbp haeiii  clones expressed high levels of adc activity. the expression was independent of the orientation of the insert with respect to the lac promoter of the vector and  also of the addition of isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, thus indicating that sequences located on the clostridial dna controlled transcription and translation. from the e. coli clone with the recombinant plasmid pug93 containing the 2.1-kbp haeiii fragment, the adc protein was purified and compared with the native enzyme. both were indistinguishable with respect to the molecular mass of  subunits and native protein as well as to activity stain. the 2.9-kbp sau3a fragment could be shown to contain the amino terminus of the acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc) gene but did not express enzyme activity. it partially overlapped with the haeiii fragment, spanning together 4,053 bp of the clostridial genome that were completely sequenced. four open reading frames (orfs) could be detected, one of which was unambiguously assigned to the acetoacetate decarboxylase (adc) gene. amino acid sequences of the n terminus and the catalytic center as deduced from the nucleotide sequence were identical to sequences obtained from direct analysis of the protein. typical procaryotic transcriptional and translational start and stop signals could be found in the dna sequence. together with these regulatory sequences, the adc gene formed a single operon. the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme proved to be rather hydrophobic. in vitro transcription-translation assays resulted in formation of adc and orf3 gene product; the other two orfs were not expressed. whereas no homology of the adc gene and orf2 could be detected with sequences available in the embl or genbank data bases, the obviously truncated orf1 showed significant similarity to alpha-amylase of bacillus subtilis. the restriction pattern and n-terminal amino acid sequence (as deduced from the nucleotide sequence) of orf3  proved to be identical to those of the large subunit of acetoacetyl coenzyme a:acetate/butyrate:coenzyme a transferase.

AB  == coenzyme a (coa)-transferase (acetoacetyl-coa:acetate/butyrate:coa-transferase [butyrate-acetoacetate coa-transferase] [ec 2.8.3.9]) of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 is an important enzyme in the metabolic shift between the acid-producing and solvent-forming states of this organism. the purification and  properties of the enzyme have recently been described (d. p. weisenborn, f. b. rudolph, and e. t. papoutsakis, appl. environ. microbiol. 55:323-329, 1989). the  genes encoding the two subunits of this enzyme have been cloned by using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes designed from amino-terminal sequencing data from each subunit of the coa-transferase. a bacteriophage lambda embl3 library of c. acetobutylicum dna was prepared and screened by using these probes. subsequent subcloning experiments established the position of the structural genes for coa-transferase. complementation of escherichia coli ato mutants with the recombinant plasmid pcoat4 (puc19 carrying a 1.8-kilobase insert of c. acetobutylicum dna encoding coa-transferase activity) enabled the transformants to grow on butyrate as a sole carbon source. despite the ability of coa-transferase to complement the ato defect in e. coli mutants, southern blot and western blot (immunoblot) analyses showed that neither the c. acetobutylicum  genes encoding coa-transferase nor the enzyme itself shared any apparent homology with its e. coli counterpart. polypeptides of mr of the purified coa-transferase  subunits were observed by western blot and maxicell analysis of whole-cell extracts of e. coli harboring pcoat4. the proximity and orientation of the genes  suggest that the genes encoding the two subunits of coa-transferase may form an operon similar to that found in e. coli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == methods for cloning key primary metabolic enzymes and ancillary proteins associated with the acetone-butanol fermentation of clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the unavailability of genetically defined mutants for complementation has intensified the problems inherent in cloning genes from c. acetobutylicum. the uniqueness of some of the pathways of this organism coupled with the relative inefficiency of transformation of clostridia and few characterized mutants in these pathways have made cloning these genes by traditional complementation methods impractical. oligonucleotide hybridization techniques have been shown to  circumvent many problems involved in detecting protein expression. the ease of hybridization screening of plaques allows phage libraries to be examined more readily than is generally the case with colony screening techniques. recombinant  lambda phages also contain more dna per insert than most plasmid vectors can maintain, thus further decreasing the amount of screening necessary. cosmid libraries, offering even greater length of individual inserts, can be screened in a similar manner, although such screening incorporates the limitations of colony  screening techniques. it is true that the technique hinges on the ability to obtain an amino acid sequence from which an oligonucleotide can be designed. in the past, the ability to obtain sequences was limited because the quantity and number of purified proteins were limited or the proteins were amino-terminally blocked. however, recent technological advances in this area, such as high-resolution gel separation techniques coupled with microsequencing, have opened the door to proteins previously inaccessible. deformylation methods have been developed to deblock amino-terminally formylated proteins, and successful internal amino acid sequence analysis by in situ protease digestion has also been reported using only picomolar quantities of proteins separated by one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. protein and dna sequence data banks have been significantly upgraded in the past few years. a proposed oligonucleotide sequence can be evaluated to determine what other possible sequences have similar homology; moreover, protein similarity comparisons between related species might  possibly supplant the need for protein isolation if regions of highly conserved amino acid sequences are found. to our knowledge, this represents the first reported use of oligonucleotide probe hybridization screening technology as a strategy for cloning solvent pathway genes of c. acetobutylicum. despite the deleterious effects on hybridization inherent in the high a + t content of c. acetobutylicum gene specific-directed oligonucleotides, the technique has been shown to function with few modifications to previously recorded systems.

AB  == a 13.6-kilobase (kb) sau3ai restriction endonuclease fragment of clostridium acetobutylicum dna cloned into pbr322 enabled escherichia coli ato mutants to grow on butyrate as a sole carbon source (but+). complementation of the ato defect by the recombinant plasmid pjc6 was due to expression of the genes for phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb) and butyrate kinase (bk). both genes were efficiently expressed in e. coli, as their products were readily detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell extracts. ptb was found to have a polypeptide subunit molecular weight of approximately 31,000, while that of bk was approximately 39,000. deletion analysis and tn5 mutagenesis of plasmid pjc7 (a but+ subclone containing a 4.4-kb bamhi fragment from the insert of pjc6) localized the ptb and bk genes within a region spanning  approximately 2.9 kb. preliminary evidence suggests that the two genes may form an operon that is transcribed as a single unit from a promoter of clostridial origin within the 4.4-kb insert of pjc7.

TI  == introduction of genes for leucine biosynthesis from clostridium pasteurianum into c. acetobutylicum by cointegrate conjugal transfer.
AB  == a clostridium pasteurianum gene bank was constructed in escherichia coli, using plasmid pat153, and several chromosomal fragments found which complemented both leub and leuc mutations in auxotrophic e. coli k12 strains. no fragments capable  of complementing leua or leud mutations were identified. conjugal transfer of the leub/leuc genes from bacillus subtilis into two different leu- c. acetobutylicum  auxotrophic strains was elicited by their incorporation into a large plasmid cointegrate composed of the conjugal plasmid pam beta 1 and a specially constructed gram-positive, replication-deficient plasmid, pmtl21 ec. inheritance  of the cointegrate plasmid restored one of the auxotrophic c. acetobutylicum strains to prototrophy. the second strain remained leu-.

TI  == stress- and growth phase-associated proteins of clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the response of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 4259 to the stresses produced by  a temperature upshift from 28 degrees c to 45 degrees c and by exposure of the organisms to 0.1% n-butanol or to air was examined by analysis of pulse-labeled proteins. the stress response was the induction of the synthesis of a number of proteins, some of which were elicited by the three forms of stress. eleven heat shock proteins were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis, as were two proteins whose synthesis was heat sensitive. in the absence of applied stress, the synthesis of four proteins was found to be associated with the growth phase in batch culture; three of these proteins had a higher rate of de novo synthesis  when the cells entered the solvent production phase. one of the stress-induced proteins, hsp74, was partially purified an found to be immunologically related to escherichia coli heat shock protein dnak. the similarities of the proteins induced at the onset of solventogenesis and by stress suggest a relationship between the two processes.

TI  == cloning and expression of a clostridium acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == an alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) gene from clostridium acetobutylicum was cloned on a recombinant plasmid, pcadh100. escherichia coli hb101, and an allyl alcohol-resistant mutant, hb101-adh1, containing this plasmid were unable to grow aerobically or anaerobically on agar media containing sublethal concentrations of allyl alcohol. e. coli hb101 and hb101-adh1 transformed with the plasmid pcadh100 produced increased levels of ethanol when grown anaerobically under alkaline conditions in the absence of nitrate. cell extracts from aerobically and anaerobically grown e. coli hb101(pcadh100) and hb101-adhl(pcadh100) cells exhibited increased levels of nadp-dependent adh activity with either ethanol or  butanol as the substrate. the inability of e. coli hb101(pcadh100) to grow in the presence of allyl alcohol correlated with the appearance of an nadp-dependent adh activity band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with either ethanol or butanol as the substrate. the position of the cloned nadp-dependent adh activity bands in e. coli hb101(pcadh100) cell extracts with either ethanol or butanol as the substrate coincided with the position of a single nadp-dependent adh activity band in extracts of c. acetobutylicum cells. e. coli  hb101(pcadh100) cell extracts prepared from both aerobically and anaerobically grown cells exhibited an additional protein band with an apparent m(r) of approximately 33,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis which was absent in cell extracts of e. coli hb101. a protein band with a similar apparent m(r) was observed in cell extracts of c. acetobutylicum, and in vitro transcription and translation experiments with pcadh100 produced a major protein product with a similar apparent m(r).

TI  == amino acid transport by membrane vesicles of an obligate anaerobic bacterium, clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == membrane vesicles were isolated from the obligate anaerobic bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum. beef heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase was inserted in these membrane vesicles by membrane fusion by using the freeze-thaw sonication technique (a. j. m. driessen, w. de vrij, and w. n. konings, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 82:7555-7559, 1985) to accommodate them with a functional proton motive  force-generating system. with ascorbate-n,n,n',n'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine-cytochrome c as the electron donor, a proton motive force (delta p) of -80 to -120 mv was generated in these fused membranes. this delta p drove the accumulation of leucine and lysine up to  40- and 100-fold, respectively. high transport activities were observed in fused  membranes containing escherichia coli lipids, whereas the transport activities in fused membranes containing mainly soybean lipids or phosphatidylcholine were low. it is suggested that branched-chain amino acids and lysine were taken up by separate systems. the effects of the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin indicated that lysine and leucine were translocated in symport with a proton.

TI  == molecular analysis and regulation of the glna gene of the gram-positive anaerobe  clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.0-kilobase dna segment containing the clostridium  acetobutylicum glna gene was determined. the upstream region of the glna gene contained two putative extended promoter consensus sequences (p1 and p2), characteristic of gram-positive bacteria. a third putative extended gram-positive promoter consensus sequence (p3), oriented towards the glna gene, was detected downstream of the structural gene. the sequences containing the proposed promoter regions p1 and p2 or p3 were shown to have promoter activity by subcloning into promoter probe vectors. the complete amino acid sequence (444 residues) of the c. acetobutylicum glutamine synthetase (gs) was deduced, and comparisons were made with the reported amino acid sequences of gs from other organisms. to determine whether the putative promoter p3 and a downstream region with an extensive stretch of inverted repeat sequences were involved in regulation of c. acetobutylicum glna gene expression by nitrogen in escherichia coli, deletion plasmids were constructed lacking p3 and various downstream sequences. deletion of the putative promoter p3 and downstream inverted repeat sequences affected the regulation of gs and reduced the levels of gs approximately fivefold under nitrogen-limiting conditions but did not affect the repression of gs levels in cells grown under nitrogen-excess conditions.

TI  == cloning, expression, and purification of glutamine synthetase from clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == a glutamine synthetase (gs) gene, glna, from the gram-positive obligate anaerobe  clostridium acetobutylicum was cloned on recombinant plasmid phz200 and enabled escherichia coli glna deletion mutants to utilize (nh(4))(2)so(4) as a sole source of nitrogen. the cloned c. acetobutylicum gene was expressed from a regulatory region contained within the cloned dna fragment. glna expression was subject to nitrogen regulation in e. coli. this cloned glna dna did not enable an e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion mutant to utilize arginine or low levels of glutamine as sole nitrogen sources, and failed to activate histidase activity in  this strain which contained the klebsiella aerogenes hut operon. the gs produced  by phz200 was purified and had an apparent subunit molecular weight of approximately 59,000. there was no dna or protein homology between the cloned c.  acetobutylicum glna gene and gs and the corresponding gene and gs from e. coli. the c. acetobutylicum gs was inhibited by mg in the gamma-glutamyl transferase assay, but there was no evidence that the gs was adenylylated.

TI  == amino acid sequence of the pyruvate and the glyoxylate active-site lysine peptide of escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  == pure 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase of escherichia coli, a "lysine-type" trimeric enzyme which has the unique properties of forming an "abortive" schiff-base intermediate with glyoxylate (the aldehydic product/substrate) and of showing strong beta-decarboxylase activity toward oxalacetate, binds any one of its substrates (2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate) in a competitive manner. to determine whether the substrates bind at the same or different (juxta-positioned) sites and what degree of homology might exist between the active-site lysine peptide of this enzyme and that of other lysine-type (class i) aldolases or beta-decarboxylases, the azomethine formed separately by this aldolase with either [14c]pyruvate or [14c]glyoxylate was reduced with cnbh3-. after each enzyme adduct was digested with trypsin, the 14c-labeled peptide was isolated, purified, and subjected to amino acid analysis  and sequence determination. in each case, the same 14-amino acid lysine-peptide was isolated and found to have the following primary sequence: glu-phe-*lys-phe-phe-pro-ala-glu-ala-asn-gly-gly-val-lys (where * = the active-site lysine). hence, glyoxylate competes for, and inhibits aldolase activity by reacting with, the one active-site lysine residue/subunit. this active-site lysine peptide has a high degree (65%) of homology with that of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of pseudomonas putida but is not similar to that of any class i fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase or of acetoacetate beta-decarboxylase of clostridium acetobutylicum. furthermore, it was found that extensive reaction of glyoxylate with the n-terminal amino group of this enzyme may well be general complicating factor in sequence studies with proteins plus glyoxylate.

TI  == cloning of clostridium acetobutylicum genes and their expression in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis.
AB  == dna from clostridium acetobutylicum abkn8 was partially digested with sau3a and the fragments obtained were inserted into the unique bamhi site of the cloning vector phv33. the recombinant plasmids were used to transform escherichia coli hb101 with selection for ampicillin resistance. a collection of ampicillin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive clones representative of the clostridium acetobutylicum genome was made. the clones were shown to carry recombinant plasmids each containing an insert of 2 to 16 kb in size. several of  them complemented the hb101 proa2 or leub6 auxotrophic mutations. the cloned sequences were shown by southern blot hybridization to be homologous to the corresponding abkn8 dna fragments.
