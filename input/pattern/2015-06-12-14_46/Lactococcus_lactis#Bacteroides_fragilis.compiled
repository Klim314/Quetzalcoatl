TI  - Improved real-time PCR assays for the detection of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters with different instrument and reagent systems.
AB  - Previously reported and redesigned primer and probe assays were evaluated for the quantitative analysis of the fecal indicator bacterial groups, Enterococcus and Bacteroidetes with three real-time PCR instrument and reagent systems. The efficiency and sensitivity of the original assays varied between systems in analyses of DNA extracts from pure cultures of Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas the modified assays gave more consistent results. Distinctions between original and modified assays also occurred in analyses of known spike levels of E. faecalis and B. fragilis cells on filters with diverse surface water retentates. Percentages of samples causing PCR failures due to inhibition were lower using the modified assays. The accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements were also generally higher, although mean measurements of both target organisms were still significantly different between systems (p < 0.05). The accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements by both modified assays were further improved using a new sample matrix control spike consisting of cultured Lactococcus lactis cells and a reference assay for this organism. Corrections provided by the L. lactis assay eliminated significant differences in E. faecalis measurements between all three systems and between two of the three systems in B. fragilis measurements.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of competitive exclusion bacteria applied to newly hatched chickens.
AB  - Competitive exclusion (CE) products are mixtures of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria applied to poultry hatchlings for prevention of Salmonella colonization. These mixtures have the potential to introduce bacteria with undesirable antimicrobial drug resistance traits into the human food supply. Antimicrobial drug susceptibilities of 27 obligate and facultative anaerobes isolated from a commercial CE product were evaluated with a microdilution minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Bacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides fragilis isolates were resistant to tetracycline and other antimicrobial drugs. An Escherichia coli isolate was resistant to four antimicrobial drugs: erythromycin, penicillin, vancomycin, and tylosin. Erythromycin-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-resistant Lactococcus lactis isolates in the CE product were detected. These findings suggest that more work needs to be done to assess the potential effects of CE product use in poultry on the food supply.
TI  - Evaluation of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - N-Acetylchitooligosaccharides ((GlcNAc)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. A chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using HCl. After purification, the purity of each (GlcNAc)(1-6) was >86%. The growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (BM) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium limosum could use (GlcNAc)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (GlcNac)(1-6). GlcNAc was used more readily than (GlcNAc)(2-6) by Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. In BM, Streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.
