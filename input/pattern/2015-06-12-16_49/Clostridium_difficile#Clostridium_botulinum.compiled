TI  - Morphological and genetic characterization of group I Clostridium botulinum type  B strain 111 and the transcriptional regulator spoIIID gene knockout mutant in sporulation.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum is a heat-resistant spore-forming bacterium that causes the serious paralytic illness botulism. Heat-resistant spores may cause food sanitation hazards and sporulation plays a central role in the survival of C. botulinum. We observed morphological changes and investigated the role of the transcriptional regulator SpoIIID in the sporulation of C. botulinum type B strain 111 in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism in C. botulinum. C. botulinum type B formed heat-resistant spores through successive morphological changes corresponding to those of Bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming model organism. An analysis of the spoIIID gene knockout mutant revealed that the transcriptional regulator SpoIIID contributed to heat-resistant spore formation by C. botulinum type B and activated the transcription of the sigK gene later during sporulation. Transcription of the spoIIID gene, which differed from that in B. subtilis and Clostridium difficile, was observed in the sigE gene knockout mutant of C. botulinum type B. An analysis of the sigF gene knockout mutant showed that the sporulation-specific sigma factor SigF was essential for transcription of the spoIIID gene in C. botulinum type B. These results suggest that the regulation of sporulation in C. botulinum is not similar to that in B. subtilis and other clostridia.
TI  - Diverse mechanisms regulate sporulation sigma factor activity in the Firmicutes.
AB  - Sporulation allows bacteria to survive adverse conditions and is essential to the lifecycle of some obligate anaerobes. In Bacillus subtilis, the sporulation-specific sigma factors, sigma(F), sigma(E), sigma(G), and sigma(K), activate compartment-specific transcriptional programs that drive sporulation through its morphological stages. The regulation of these sigma factors was predicted to be conserved across the Firmicutes, since the regulatory proteins controlling their activation are largely conserved. However, recent studies in (Pepto)Clostridium difficile, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum have revealed striking differences in the order, activation, and function of sporulation sigma factors. These studies indicate that gene conservation does not necessarily predict gene function and that new mechanisms for controlling cell fate determination remain to be discovered in the anaerobic Clostridia.
TI  - Infant botulism: is there an association with thiamine deficiency?
AB  - Infant botulism is an acute life-threatening condition and diagnosis is frequently delayed. Therefore, the best time window to administer specific antibodies, at present the only etiology-based therapy, is often missed, entailing long periods of hospitalization in the PICU. Here we present a 3-month-old boy with infant botulism and respiratory failure, who quickly and favorably responded to thiamine supplementation. From the feces we isolated Clostridium botulinum serotype A2. In addition to producing botulinum neurotoxin A, this strain carried the thiaminase I gene and produced thiaminase I. Accordingly, the child's feces were positive for thiaminase I activity. Because C botulinum group I strains are capable of producing thiaminase I, we speculate that thiamine degradation might further aggravate the paralytic symptoms caused by botulinum neurotoxins in infant botulism. Thus, supportive supplementation with thiamine could be beneficial to speed up recovery and to shorten hospitalization in some patients with infant botulism.
TI  - Immunological function of familial Mediterranean fever disease protein Pyrin.
AB  - Pyrin, encoded by MEFV gene, is conserved in humans and mice. Mutations in the MEFV gene are associated with the human autoinflammatory disease familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Pyrin can interact with the inflammasome adaptor ASC and induce inflammatory caspase-1 activation in monocytic cells, but the physiological function of Pyrin has been unknown for many years. Here we summarize previous studies of Pyrin function under the context of FMF and immunity, and discuss a recent study demonstrating that Pyrin forms an inflammasome complex for caspase-1 activation in innate immunity. Pyrin inflammasome detects inactivating modifications of host Rho GTPases by diverse bacterial toxins and infections, including Clostridium difficile glucosylating cytotoxin TcdB, FIC-domain adenylyltransferase effectors from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Histophilus somni, ADP-ribosylating Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin as well as Burkholderia cenocepacia infection. The mode of Pyrin action, i.e., sensing pathogen virulence activity rather than directly recognizing a microbial molecule, represents a new paradigm in innate immunity.
TI  - Clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  - Some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. These Gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include Clostridium botulinum (C2 toxin), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile toxin or CDT), Clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or BEC), Clostridium spiroforme (C. spiroforme toxin or CST), as well as Bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or VIP). These gut-acting proteins form an AB complex composed of ADP-ribosyl transferase (A) and cell-binding (B) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. Once inside the cytosol, the A components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-ADP-ribosylation of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. Important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.
TI  - Cyclophilin-facilitated membrane translocation as pharmacological target to prevent intoxication of mammalian cells by binary clostridial actin ADP-ribosylated toxins.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium difficile CDT belong to the family of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins and are composed of a binding/translocation component and a separate enzyme component. The enzyme components ADP-ribosylate G-actin in the cytosol of target cells resulting in depolymerization of F-actin, cell rounding and cell death. The binding/translocation components bind to their cell receptors and form complexes with the respective enzyme components. After receptor-mediated endocytosis, the binding/translocation components form pores in membranes of acidified endosomes and the enzyme components translocate through these pores into the cytosol. This step is facilitated by the host cell chaperone heat shock protein 90 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases including cyclophilin A. Here, we demonstrate that a large isoform of cyclophilin A, the multi-domain enzyme cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40), binds to the enzyme components C2I, Ia and CDTa in vitro. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a direct binding to C2I with a calculated affinity of 101 nM and to Ia with an affinity of 1.01 muM. Closer investigation for the prototypic C2I revealed that binding to Cyp40 did not depend on its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but was stronger for unfolded C2I. The interaction of C2I with Cyp40 was also demonstrated in lysates from C2-treated cells by pull-down. Treatment of cells with a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine A derivative, which still binds to and inhibits the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins, protected cells from intoxication with C2, iota and CDT toxins, offering an attractive approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies against binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins.
TI  - Tailored cyclodextrin pore blocker protects mammalian cells from clostridium difficile binary toxin CDT.
AB  - Some Clostridium difficile strains produce, in addition to toxins A and B, the binary toxin Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT), which ADP-ribosylates actin and may contribute to the hypervirulence of these strains. The separate binding and translocation component CDTb mediates transport of the enzyme component CDTa into mammalian target cells. CDTb binds to its receptor on the cell surface, CDTa assembles and CDTb/CDTa complexes are internalised. In acidic endosomes, CDTb mediates the delivery of CDTa into the cytosol, most likely by forming a translocation pore in endosomal membranes. We demonstrate that a seven-fold symmetrical positively charged beta-cyclodextrin derivative, per-6-S-(3-aminomethyl)benzylthio-beta-cyclodextrin, which was developed earlier as a potent inhibitor of the translocation pores of related binary toxins of Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium perfringens, protects cells from intoxication with CDT. The pore blocker did not interfere with the CDTa-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of actin or toxin binding to Vero cells but inhibited the pH-dependent membrane translocation of CDTa into the cytosol. In conclusion, the cationic beta-cyclodextrin could serve as the lead compound in a development of novel pharmacological strategies against the CDT-producing strains of C. difficile.
TI  - Innate immune sensing of bacterial modifications of Rho GTPases by the Pyrin inflammasome.
AB  - Cytosolic inflammasome complexes mediated by a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) defend against pathogen infection by activating caspase 1. Pyrin, a candidate PRR, can bind to the inflammasome adaptor ASC to form a caspase 1-activating complex. Mutations in the Pyrin-encoding gene, MEFV, cause a human autoinflammatory disease known as familial Mediterranean fever. Despite important roles in immunity and disease, the physiological function of Pyrin remains unknown. Here we show that Pyrin mediates caspase 1 inflammasome activation in response to Rho-glucosylation activity of cytotoxin TcdB, a major virulence factor of Clostridium difficile, which causes most cases of nosocomial diarrhoea. The glucosyltransferase-inactive TcdB mutant loses the inflammasome-stimulating activity. Other Rho-inactivating toxins, including FIC-domain adenylyltransferases (Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopS and Histophilus somni IbpA) and Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosylating C3 toxin, can also biochemically activate the Pyrin inflammasome in their enzymatic activity-dependent manner. These toxins all target the Rho subfamily and modify a switch-I residue. We further demonstrate that Burkholderia cenocepacia inactivates RHOA by deamidating Asn 41, also in the switch-I region, and thereby triggers Pyrin inflammasome activation, both of which require the bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS). Loss of the Pyrin inflammasome causes elevated intra-macrophage growth of B. cenocepacia and diminished lung inflammation in mice. Thus, Pyrin functions to sense pathogen modification and inactivation of Rho GTPases, representing a new paradigm in mammalian innate immunity.
TI  - Occurrence of zoonotic clostridia and Yersinia in healthy cattle.
AB  - Zoonotic pathogens are a frequent cause of disease worldwide. This study was designed to determine the occurrence of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium botulinum, and Yersinia enterocolitica in cattle in southern Bavaria, Germany. The study population included 49 farms; 34 were dairy farms (30 also fattening beef cattle) and 15 were solely beef cattle farms. Fecal and dust samples were collected from summer 2011 to summer 2012 and analyzed using a combination of enrichment procedures and real-time PCR. For the detection of C. difficile, samples were screened for the presence of the tpi gene and toxin genes tcdA, tcdB, and cdtA. Samples also were screened for genes for C. botulinum toxins A through F and for the ail gene of Y. enterocolitica. Of 506 samples, C. difficile genes were found in 29 samples (5.7%): 25 samples from dairy farms and 4 samples from beef cattle farms. Toxin genes were identified in 17 samples, with toxigenic profiles of A(+)B(+)CDT(-), A(+)B(-)CDT(+), and A(+)B(+)CDT(+). C. botulinum toxin genes were not detected in fecal samples from cattle, but the gene for toxin B was detected in 1 (0.8%) of 125 dust samples. Y. enterocolitica genes were found in 6 (1.6%) of 382 fecal samples from three dairy farms and one beef cattle farm. This study revealed that C. difficile and Y. enterocolitica are rare on cattle farms in Bavaria, Germany. In contrast to results of previous studies, C. botulinum was not detected in fecal samples but was found very rarely in dust samples from the cattle environment.
TI  - Cyclodextrin derivatives as anti-infectives.
AB  - Cyclodextrin derivatives can be utilized as anti-infectives with pore-forming proteins as the targets. The highly efficient selection of potent inhibitors was achieved because per-substituted cyclodextrins have the same symmetry as the target pores. Inhibitors of several bacterial toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium difficile were identified from a library of approximately 200 CD derivatives. It was demonstrated that multi-targeted inhibitors can be found using this approach and could be utilized for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against various pathogens.
TI  - Genetic characteristics of toxigenic Clostridia and toxin gene evolution.
AB  - Clostridia comprise a heterogenous group of environmental bacteria containing 15  pathogenic species, which produce the most potent toxins. The origin of toxins is still enigmatic. It is hypothesized that toxins exhibiting an enzymatic activity have derived from hydrolytic enzymes, which are abundantly secreted by these bacteria, and that pore-forming toxins have evolved from an ancestor transmembrane protein. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct Clostridium species and the variability of some toxin genes support horizontal toxin gene transfer and subsequent independent evolution from strain to strain. Clostridium perfringens toxin genes involved in myonecrosis, mainly alpha toxin and perfringolysin genes, are chromosomally located, whereas toxin genes responsible for intestinal and food borne diseases are localized on plasmids except the enterotoxin gene which can be located either on the chromosome or plasmids. The distribution of these plasmids containing one or several toxin genes accounts for the diverse C. perfringens toxinotypes. Clostridium difficile strains show a high genetic variability. But in contrast to C. perfringens, toxin genes are clustered in pathogenicity locus located on chromosome. The presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridial species like Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium novyi, and C. perfringens supports interspecies mobilization of this locus. The multiple C. difficile toxinotypes based on toxin gene variants possibly reflect strain adaptation to the intestinal environment. Botulinum toxin genes also show a high level of genetic variation. They have a diverse genetic localization including chromosome, plasmid or phage, and are spread in various Clostridium species (Clostridium botulinum groups, Clostridium argentinense, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium baratii). Exchange of toxin genes not only include transfers between Clostridium species but also between Clostridium and other bacterial species as well as eukaryotic cells as supported by the wide distribution of related pore-forming toxins of the aerolysin family in various clostridial and non-clostridial species, animal, mushroom and plant.
TI  - Detection of Clostridium difficile in small and medium-sized wild Mammals in Southern Ontario, Canada.
AB  - We sampled 325 small and medium-sized wild mammals in Ontario, Canada in 2007 and 2010 to determine the prevalence and characteristics of Clostridium difficile in wild mammals living in proximity to captive wildlife and livestock. Clostridium difficile was isolated from five of 109 animals (4.6%) on four of 25 farms (16%), but was not isolated from any of the 216 samples from raccoons (Procyon lotor) living on the grounds of the Toronto Zoo. The positive animals included two raccoons from one beef farm, one raccoon from a different beef farm, one raccoon from a swine farm, and a shrew (Blarina brevicauda) from a dairy farm. None had evidence of gastrointestinal disease. Three of the five isolates were toxinotype variants (II, IV, and XIII) that are rarely identified in humans and domestic animals. The other two were toxinotype 0, a common toxinotype in humans and animals; however, all five isolates were of different ribotypes. None of the recovered ribotypes were recognized as ribotypes present in the authors' reference library of over 3,000 human and domestic animal C. difficile isolates. Neither the public health nor the animal health relevance of these findings is clear. It is not known whether C. difficile is a pathogen of small and medium-sized wild mammals, although the susceptibility of various laboratory species suggests it could cause disease.
TI  - Identification of novel host-targeted compounds that protect from anthrax lethal  toxin-induced cell death.
AB  - Studying how pathogens subvert the host to cause disease has contributed to the understanding of fundamental cell biology. Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, produces the virulence factor lethal toxin to disarm host immunity and cause pathology. We conducted a phenotypic small molecule screen to identify inhibitors of lethal toxin-induced macrophage cell death and used an ordered series of secondary assays to characterize the hits and determine their effects on cellular function. We identified a structurally diverse set of small molecules that act at various points along the lethal toxin pathway, including inhibitors of endocytosis, natural product inhibitors of organelle acidification (e.g., the botulinum neurotoxin inhibitor, toosendanin), and a novel proteasome inhibitor, 4MNB (4-methoxy-2-[2-(5-methoxy-2-nitrosophenyl)ethyl]-1-nitrosobenzene). Many of the compounds, including three drugs approved for use in humans, also protected against the related Clostridium difficile toxin TcdB, further demonstrating their value as novel tools for perturbation and study of toxin biology and host cellular processes and highlighting potential new strategies for intervening on toxin-mediated diseases.
TI  - CD44 Promotes intoxication by the clostridial iota-family toxins.
AB  - Various pathogenic clostridia produce binary protein toxins associated with enteric diseases of humans and animals. Separate binding/translocation (B) components bind to a protein receptor on the cell surface, assemble with enzymatic (A) component(s), and mediate endocytosis of the toxin complex. Ultimately there is translocation of A component(s) from acidified endosomes into the cytosol, leading to destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. Our results revealed that CD44, a multifunctional surface protein of mammalian cells, facilitates intoxication by the iota family of clostridial binary toxins. Specific antibody against CD44 inhibited cytotoxicity of the prototypical Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Versus CD44(+) melanoma cells, those lacking CD44 bound less toxin and were dose-dependently resistant to C. perfringens iota, as well as Clostridium difficile and Clostridium spiroforme iota-like, toxins. Purified CD44 specifically interacted in vitro with iota and iota-like, but not related Clostridium botulinum C2, toxins. Furthermore, CD44 knockout mice were resistant to iota toxin lethality. Collective data reveal an important role for CD44 during intoxication by a family of clostridial binary toxins.
TI  - Prophage carriage and diversity within clinically relevant strains of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Prophages are encoded in most genomes of sequenced Clostridium difficile strains. They are key components of the mobile genetic elements and, as such, are likely to influence the biology of their host strains. The majority of these phages are not amenable to propagation, and therefore the development of a molecular marker is a useful tool with which to establish the extent and diversity of C. difficile prophage carriage within clinical strains. To design markers, several candidate genes were analyzed including structural and holin genes. The holin gene is the only gene present in all sequenced phage genomes, conserved at both terminals, with a variable mid-section. This allowed us to design two sets of degenerate PCR primers specific to C. difficile myoviruses and siphoviruses. Subsequent PCR analysis of 16 clinical C. difficile ribotypes showed that 15 of them are myovirus positive, and 2 of them are also siphovirus positive. Antibiotic induction and transmission electron microscope analysis confirmed the molecular prediction of myoviruses and/or siphovirus presence. Phylogenetic analysis of the holin sequences identified three groups of C. difficile phages, two within the myoviruses and a divergent siphovirus group. The marker also produced tight groups within temperate phages that infect other taxa, including Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Bacillus spp., which suggests the potential application of the holin gene to study prophage carriage in other bacteria. This study reveals the high incidence of prophage carriage in clinically relevant strains of C. difficile and correlates the molecular data to the morphological observation.
TI  - Bidirectional attack on the actin cytoskeleton. Bacterial protein toxins causing  polymerization or depolymerization of actin.
AB  - The actin cytoskeleton is one of the major targets of bacterial protein toxins. The family of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins, including Clostridium difficile transferase CDT, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, modifies arginine-177 of actin. Thereby actin polymerization is blocked. By contrast, actin polymerization is facilitated by the tripartite Photorhabdus luminescens toxin complex including TccC3, which modifies actin at threonine-148. The review discusses both toxin families in respect to recent findings.
TI  - Cellular cytoskeleton dynamics modulates non-viral gene delivery through RhoGTPases.
AB  - Although it is well accepted that the constituents of the cellular microenvironment modulate a myriad of cellular processes, including cell morphology, cytoskeletal dynamics and uptake pathways, the underlying mechanism of how these pathways influence non-viral gene transfer have not been studied. Transgene expression is increased on fibronectin (Fn) coated surfaces as a consequence of increased proliferation, cell spreading and active engagement of clathrin endocytosis pathway. RhoGTPases mediate the crosstalk between the cell and Fn, and regulate cellular processes involving filamentous actin, in-response to cellular interaction with Fn. Here the role of RhoGTPases specifically Rho, Rac and Cdc42 in modulation of non-viral gene transfer in mouse mesenchymal stem (mMSCs) plated in a fibronectin microenvironment was studied. More than 90% decrease in transgene expression was observed after inactivation of RhoGTPases using difficile toxin B (TcdB) and C3 transferase. Expression of dominant negative RhoA (RhoAT19N), Rac1(Rac1T17N) and Cdc42 (Cdc42T17N) also significantly reduced polyplex uptake and transgene expression. Interactions of cells with Fn lead to activation of RhoGTPases. However, further activation of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 by expression of constitutively active genes (RhoAQ63L, Rac1Q61L and Cdc42Q61L) did not further enhance transgene expression in mMSCs, when plated on Fn. In contrast, activation of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 by expression of constitutively active genes for cells plated on collagen I, which by itself did not increase RhoGTPase activation, resulted in enhanced transgene expression. Our study shows that RhoGTPases regulate internalization and effective intracellular processing of polyplexes that results in efficient gene transfer.
TI  - FK506-binding protein 51 interacts with Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and FK506  inhibits membrane translocation of the toxin in mammalian cells.
AB  - The binary Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin consists of the binding/translocation component C2IIa and the separate enzyme component C2I. C2IIa delivers C2I into the cytosol of eukaryotic target cells where C2I ADP-ribosylates actin. After receptor-mediated endocytosis of the C2IIa/C2I complex, C2IIa forms pores in membranes of acidified early endosomes and unfolded C2I translocates through the pores into the cytosol. Membrane translocation of C2I is facilitated by the activities of host cell chaperone Hsp90 and the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) cyclophilin A. Here, we demonstrated that Hsp90 co-precipitates with C2I from lysates of C2 toxin-treated cells and identified the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 51 as a novel interaction partner of C2I in vitro and in intact mammalian cells. Prompted by this finding, we used the specific pharmacological inhibitor FK506 to investigate whether the PPIase activity of FKBPs plays a role during membrane translocation of C2 toxin. Treatment of cells with FK506 protected cultured cells from intoxication with C2 toxin. Moreover, FK506 inhibited the pH-dependent translocation of C2I across membranes into the cytosol but did not interfere with the enzyme activity of C2I or binding of C2 toxin to cells. Furthermore, FK506 treatment delayed intoxication with the related binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins from Clostridium perfringens (iota toxin) and Clostridium difficile (CDT) but not with the Rho-glucosylating Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA). In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that clostridial binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins share a specific FKBP-dependent translocation mechanism during their uptake into mammalian cells.
TI  - Cells transformed by PLC-gamma 1 overexpression are highly sensitive to clostridium difficile toxin A-induced apoptosis and mitotic inhibition.
AB  - Phospholipase C-gammal (PLC-gammal) expression is associated with cellular transformation. Notably, PLC-gamma is up-regulated in colorectal cancer tissue and breast carcinoma. Because exotoxins released by Clostridium botulinum have been shown to induce apoptosis and promote growth arrest in various cancer cell lines, we examined here the potential of Clostridium difficile toxin A to selectively induce apoptosis in cells transformed by PLC-gammal overexpression. We found that PLC-gammal-transformed cells, but not vectortransformed (control) cells, were highly sensitive to C. difficile toxin A-induced apoptosis and mitotic inhibition. Moreover, expression of the proapoptotic Bcl2 family member, Bim, and activation of caspase-3 were significantly up-regulated by toxin A in PLC-gammal-transformed cells. Toxin A-induced cell rounding and paxillin dephosphorylation were also significantly higher in PLC-gammal-transformed cells than in control cells. These findings suggest that C. difficile toxin A may have potential as an anticancer agent against colorectal cancers and breast carcinomas in which PLC-gammal is highly up-regulated.
TI  - Identification of the cellular receptor of Clostridium spiroforme toxin.
AB  - Clostridium spiroforme produces the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin CST (C. spiroforme toxin), which has been proposed to be responsible for diarrhea, enterocolitis, and eventually death, especially in rabbits. Here we report on the recombinant production of the enzyme component (CSTa) and the binding component (CSTb) of C. spiroforme toxin in Bacillus megaterium. By using the recombinant toxin components, we show that CST enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), which has been recently identified as the host cell receptor of the binary toxins Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT) and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Microscopic studies revealed that CST, but not the related Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, colocalized with LSR during toxin uptake and traffic to endosomal compartments. Our findings indicate that CST shares LSR with C. difficile CDT and C. perfringens iota toxin as a host cell surface receptor.
TI  - Effects of different replicons in conjugative plasmids on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression and n-butanol biosynthesis in Clostridium tyrobutyricum.
AB  - Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 can produce butyric acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen as the main products from various carbon sources. In this study, C. tyrobutyricum was used as a host to produce n-butanol by expressing adhE2 gene under the control of a native thiolase promoter using four different conjugative plasmids (pMTL82151, 83151, 84151, and 85151) each with a different replicon (pBP1 from C. botulinum NCTC2916, pCB102 from C. butyricum, pCD6 from Clostridium difficile, and pIM13 from Bacillus subtilis). The effects of different replicons on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, adhE2 expression and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase activities, and butanol production by different mutants of C. tyrobutyricum were investigated. Among the four plasmids and replicons studied, pMTL82151 with pBP1 gave the highest transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression, and butanol biosynthesis. Butanol production from various substrates, including glucose, xylose, mannose, and mannitol were then investigated with the best mutant strain harboring adhE2 in pMTL82151. A high butanol titer of 20.5 g/L with 0.33 g/g yield and 0.32 g/L h productivity was obtained with mannitol as the substrate in batch fermentation with pH controlled at ~6.0.
TI  - Gas discharge plasmas are effective in inactivating Bacillus and Clostridium spores.
AB  - Bacterial spores are the most resistant form of life and have been a major threat to public health and food safety. Nonthermal atmospheric gas discharge plasma is a novel sterilization method that leaves no chemical residue. In our study, a helium radio-frequency cold plasma jet was used to examine its sporicidal effect on selected strains of Bacillus and Clostridium. The species tested included Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium botulinum type A and type E. The plasmas were effective in inactivating selected Bacillus and Clostridia spores with D values (decimal reduction time) ranging from 2 to 8 min. Among all spores tested, C. botulinum type A and C. sporogenes were significantly more resistant to plasma inactivation than other species. Observations by phase contrast microscopy showed that B. subtilis spores were severely damaged by plasmas and the majority of the treated spores were unable to initiate the germination process. There was no detectable fragmentation of the DNA when the spores were treated for up to 20 min. The release of dipicolinic acid was observed almost immediately after the plasma treatment, indicating the spore envelope damage could occur quickly resulting in dipicolinic acid release and the reduction of spore resistance.
TI  - Retargeting Clostridium difficile Toxin B to Neuronal Cells as a Potential Vehicle for Cytosolic Delivery of Therapeutic Biomolecules to Treat Botulism.
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) deliver a protease to neurons which can cause a flaccid paralysis called botulism. Development of botulism antidotes will require neuronal delivery of agents that inhibit or destroy the BoNT protease. Here, we investigated the potential of engineering Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) as a neuronal delivery vehicle by testing two recombinant TcdB chimeras. For AGT-TcdB chimera, an alkyltransferase (AGT) was appended to the N-terminal glucosyltransferase (GT) of TcdB. Recombinant AGT-TcdB had alkyltransferase activity, and the chimera was nearly as toxic to Vero cells as wild-type TcdB, suggesting efficient cytosolic delivery of the AGT/GT fusion. For AGT-TcdB-BoNT/A-Hc, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of TcdB was replaced by the equivalent RBD from BoNT/A (BoNT/A-Hc). AGT-TcdB-BoNT/A-Hc was >25-fold more toxic to neuronal cells and >25-fold less toxic to Vero cells than AGT-TcdB. Thus, TcdB can be engineered for cytosolic delivery of biomolecules and improved targeting of neuronal cells.
TI  - Role of Rho GTPases in human trophoblast migration induced by IGFBP1.
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), the main secretory product of the decidualized endometrium of a pregnant woman, has previously been shown to interact with the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cell surface to stimulate its migration in an IGF-independent manner. This migration stimulation has also been shown to require activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2; mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] 3/1]) and focal adhesion kinase. The present study examined the roles of Rho GTPases RHOA, RHOC, RAC1, and CDC42 as well as RHO kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 in IGFBP1-mediated migration of an immortalized EVT cell line HTR-8/SVneo. A nonselective RHO kinase inhibitor, Y27632, as well as siRNAs selective for ROCK1 and ROCK2 decreased the migration of these cells in a Transwell migration assay, and this inhibition could not be restored by IGFBP1. Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inhibits all the Rho GTPases, RAC inhibitor NSC23766, RAC1 siRNA, and CDC42 siRNA, decreased their basal migration, but none of these inhibitions except CDC42 siRNA-induced inhibition could be restored by IGFBP1. Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme that inhibits RHOA, RHOB, and RHOC inhibited basal migration but not IGFBP1-induced migration. IGFBP1-induced activation of ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1), which did not require RHO proteins, might function as an alternate pathway for RHO action. However, selective siRNA-mediated downregulation of RHOA inhibited basal, but not IGFBP1-mediated, migration, whereas that of RHOC inhibited both basal and IGFBP1-mediated migration of these EVT cells. Therefore, RHO kinase, RHOC, and RAC1 are essential, but RHOA and CDC42 are not essential, for IGFBP1-induced EVT migration.
TI  - ClosTron-mediated engineering of Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium is a diverse assemblage of Gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. Whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. Clostridium difficile, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. Prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium beijerinkii, Clostridium thermocellum, and Clostridium phytofermentans. The prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. The historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in Clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by ClosTron technology. The ClosTron uses a retargeted group II intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert DNA into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo DNA delivery. The procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.
TI  - Disinfection methods for spores of Bacillus atrophaeus, B. anthracis, Clostridium tetani, C. botulinum and C. difficile.
AB  - To evaluate disinfection methods for environments contaminated with bioterrorism-associated microorganism (Bacillus anthracis), we performed the following experiments. First, the sporicidal effects of sodium hypochlorite on spores of five bacterial species were evaluated. Bacillus atrophaeus was the most resistant to hypochlorite, followed in order by B. anthracis, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium difficile. Subsequently, using B. atrophaeus spores that were the most resistant to hypochlorite, the sporicidal effects of hypochlorite at lower pH by adding vinegar were evaluated. Hypochlorite containing vinegar had far more marked sporicidal effects than hypochlorite alone. Cleaning with 0.5% (5000 ppm) hypochlorite containing vinegar inactivated B. atrophaeus spores attached to vinyl chloride and plywood plates within 15 s, while that not containing vinegar did not inactivate spores attached to cement or plywood plates even after 1 h. Therefore, the surfaces of cement or plywood plates were covered with gauze soaked in 0.5% hypochlorite containing vinegar, and the sporicidal effects were evaluated. B. atrophaeus spores attached to plywood plates were not inactivated even after 6 h, but those attached to cement plates were inactivated within 5 min. On the other hand, covering the surfaces of plywood plates with gauze soaked in 0.3% peracetic acid and gauze soaked in 2% glutaral inactivated B. atrophaeus spores within 5 min and 6 h, respectively. These results suggest that hypochlorite containing vinegar is effective for disinfecting vinyl chloride, tile, and cement plates contaminated with B. anthracis, and peracetic acid is effective for disinfecting plywood plates contaminated with such microorganism.
TI  - Membrane translocation of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins from Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens is facilitated by cyclophilin A and Hsp90.
AB  - Some hypervirulent strains of Clostridium difficile produce the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin C. difficile transferase (CDT) in addition to Rho-glucosylating toxins A and B. It has been suggested that the presence of CDT increases the severity of C. difficile-associated diseases, including pseudomembranous colitis. CDT contains a binding and translocation component, CDTb, that mediates the transport of the separate enzyme component CDTa into the cytosol of target cells, where CDTa modifies actin. Here we investigated the mechanism of cellular CDT uptake and found that bafilomycin A1 protects cultured epithelial cells from intoxication with CDT, implying that CDTa is translocated from acidified endosomal vesicles into the cytosol. Consistently, CDTa is translocated across the cytoplasmic membranes into the cytosol when cell-bound CDT is exposed to acidic medium. Radicicol and cyclosporine A, inhibitors of the heat shock protein Hsp90 and cyclophilins, respectively, protected cells from intoxication with CDT but not from intoxication with toxins A and B. Moreover, both inhibitors blocked the pH-dependent membrane translocation of CDTa, strongly suggesting that Hsp90 and cyclophilin are crucial for this process. In contrast, the inhibitors did not interfere with the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, receptor binding, or endocytosis of the toxin. We obtained comparable results with the closely related iota-toxin from Clostridium perfringens. Moreover, CDTa and Ia, the enzyme component of iota-toxin, specifically bound to immobilized Hsp90 and cyclophilin A in vitro. In combination with our recently obtained data on the C2 toxin from C. botulinum, these results imply a common Hsp90/cyclophilin A-dependent translocation mechanism for the family of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins.
TI  - Quantitative mass spectrometry for bacterial protein toxins--a sensitive, specific, high-throughput tool for detection and diagnosis.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) is a valuable high-throughput tool for peptide analysis. Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (LC-ESI) tandem-MS provides sensitive and specific quantification of small molecules and peptides. The high analytic power of MS coupled with high-specificity substrates is ideally suited for detection and quantification of bacterial enzymatic activities. As specific examples of the MS applications in disease diagnosis and select agent detection, we describe recent advances in the analyses of two high profile protein toxin groups, the Bacillus anthracis toxins and the Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins. The two binary toxins produced by B. anthracis consist of protective antigen (PA) which combines with lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), forming lethal toxin and edema toxin respectively. LF is a zinc-dependent endoprotease which hydrolyzes specific proteins involved in inflammation and immunity. EF is an adenylyl cyclase which converts ATP to cyclic-AMP. Toxin-specific enzyme activity for a strategically designed substrate, amplifies reaction products which are detected by MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS. Pre-concentration/purification with toxin specific monoclonal antibodies provides additional specificity. These combined technologies have achieved high specificity, ultrasensitive detection and quantification of the anthrax toxins. We also describe potential applications to diseases of high public health impact, including Clostridium difficile glucosylating toxins and the Bordetella pertussis adenylyl cyclase.
TI  - Small RNAs in the genus Clostridium.
AB  - The genus Clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not been investigated in clostridia. Research on sRNAs in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify sRNA candidates, thus delegating clostridial sRNA research to a hit-and-miss process. Thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential sRNAs in the Clostridium genus to open up the field of sRNA research in clostridia. Using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted sRNAs in 21 clostridial genomes: Clostridium acetobutylicum, C. beijerinckii, C. botulinum (eight strains), C. cellulolyticum, C. difficile, C. kluyveri (two strains), C. novyi, C. perfringens (three strains), C. phytofermentans, C. tetani, and C. thermocellum. Although more than one-third of predicted sRNAs have Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of SD sequences; thus, most of the predicted sRNAs are noncoding RNAs. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) and Northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of sRNAs in C. acetobutylicum and several C. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested sRNAs. We identified a conserved, novel sRNA which, together with the downstream gene coding for an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. The number of predicted sRNAs correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic, and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16S rRNA-based phylogeny.
TI  - Clostridial binary toxins: iota and C2 family portraits.
AB  - There are many pathogenic Clostridium species with diverse virulence factors that include protein toxins. Some of these bacteria, such as C. botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. spiroforme, cause enteric problems in animals as well as humans. These often fatal diseases can partly be attributed to binary protein toxins that follow a classic AB paradigm. Within a targeted cell, all clostridial binary toxins destroy filamentous actin via mono-ADP-ribosylation of globular actin by the A component. However, much less is known about B component binding to cell-surface receptors. These toxins share sequence homology amongst themselves and with those produced by another Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium also commonly associated with soil and disease: Bacillus anthracis. This review focuses upon the iota and C2 families of clostridial binary toxins and includes: (1) basics of the bacterial source; (2) toxin biochemistry; (3) sophisticated cellular uptake machinery; and (4) host-cell responses following toxin-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton. In summary, these protein toxins aid diverse enteric species within the genus Clostridium.
TI  - From cosubstrate similarity to inhibitor diversity--inhibitors of ADP-ribosyltransferases from kinase inhibitor screening.
AB  - ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADP-RTs) use NAD(+) to transfer an ADP-ribosyl group to  target proteins. Although some ADP-RTs are bacterial toxins only few inhibitors are known. Here we present the development of fluorescence-based assays and a focussed library screening using kinase inhibitors as a new approach towards inhibitors of ADP-RTs. Different screening setups were established using surrogate small molecule substrates or the quantitation of the cofactor NAD(+). Proof-of-principle screening experiments were performed using a kinase inhibitor library in order to target the NAD(+) binding pockets. This led to the discovery of structurally different lead inhibitors for the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases Mosquitocidal toxin (MTX) from Bacillus sphaericus SSII-1, C3bot toxin from Clostridium botulinum and CDTa from Clostridium difficile. The interaction of the inhibitors with the toxin proteins was analyzed by means of docking and binding free energy calculations. Binding at the nicotinamide subpocket, which shows a significant difference in the three enzymes, is used to explain the selectivity of the identified inhibitors and offers an opportunity for further development of potent and selective inhibitors.
TI  - Differential role of Rho GTPases in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation in vitro.
AB  - Maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier functions is crucial to prevent systemic contamination by microbes that penetrate from the gut lumen. GTPases of the Rho-family such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are known to be critically involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier functions. However, it is still unclear whether inactivation or activation of these GTPases exerts barrier protection or not. We tested the effects of Rho GTPase activities on intestinal epithelial barrier functions by using the bacterial toxins cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF-1), toxin B, C3 transferase (C3 TF), and lethal toxin (LT) in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Incubation of cell monolayers with CNF-1 for 3 h induced exclusive activation of RhoA whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were unchanged. As revealed by FITC-dextran flux and measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) intestinal epithelial permeability was significantly increased under these conditions. Inhibition of Rho kinase via Y27632 blocked barrier destabilization of CNF-1 after 3 h. In contrast, after 24 h of incubation with CNF-1 only Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA were activated which resulted in intestinal epithelial barrier stabilization. Toxin B to inactivate RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 as well as Rac1 inhibitor LT increased intestinal epithelial permeability. Similar effects were observed after inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling by C3 TF or Y27632. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both activation and inactivation of RhoA signaling increased paracellular permeability whereas activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 correlated with stabilized barrier functions.
TI  - Peptide inhibitors targeting Clostridium difficile toxins A and B.
AB  - Clostridium difficile causes severe hospital-acquired antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to the activity of two large protein toxins. Current treatments suffer from a high relapse rate and are generating resistant strains; thus new methods of dealing with these infections that target the virulence factors directly are of interest. Phage display was used to identify peptides that bind to the catalytic domain of C. difficile Toxin A. Library screening and subsequent quantitative binding and inhibition studies showed that several of these peptides are potent inhibitors. Fragment-based computational docking of these peptides elucidated the binding modes within the active site. These antitoxin peptides may serve as potential lead compounds to further engineer peptidomimetic inhibitors of the clostridial toxins.
TI  - Inhibition of Rho-ROCK signaling induces apoptotic and non-apoptotic PS exposure  in cardiomyocytes via inhibition of flippase.
AB  - Subsequent to myocardial infarction, cardiomyocytes within the infarcted areas and border zones expose phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer plasma membrane leaflet (flip-flop). We showed earlier that in addition to apoptosis, this flip-flop can be reversible in cardiomyocytes. We now investigated a possible role for Rho and downstream effector Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in the process of (reversible) PS exposure and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. In rat cardiomyoblasts (H9c2 cells) and isolated adult ventricular rat cardiomyocytes Clostridium difficile Toxin B (TcdB), a Rho GTPase family inhibitor, C3 transferase (C3), a Rho(A,B,C) inhibitor and the ROCK inhibitors Y27632 and H1152 were used to inhibit Rho-ROCK signaling. PS exposure was assessed via flow cytometry and fluorescent digital imaging microscopy using annexin V. Akt expression and phosphorylation were analyzed via Western blot, and Akt activity was inhibited by wortmannin. The cellular concentration activated caspase 3 was determined as a measure of apoptosis, and flippase activity was assessed via flow cytometry using NBD-labeled PS. TcdB, C3, Y27632 and H1152 all significantly increased PS exposure. TcdB, Y27632 and H1152 all significantly inhibited phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Akt and Akt inhibition by wortmannin lead to increased PS exposure. However, only TcdB and C3, but not ROCK- or Akt inhibition led to caspase 3 activation and thus apoptosis. Notably, pancaspase inhibitor zVAD only partially inhibited TcdB-induced PS exposure indicating the existence of apoptotic and non-apoptotic PS exposure. The induced PS exposure coincided with decreased flippase activity as measured with NBD-labeled PS flip-flop. In this study, we show a regulatory role for a novel signaling route, Rho-ROCK-flippase signaling, in maintaining asymmetrical membrane phospholipid distribution in cardiomyocytes.
TI  - ClosTron-targeted mutagenesis.
AB  - Members of the genus Clostridium have long been recognised as important to humankind and its animals, both in terms of the diseases they cause and the useful biological processes they undertake. This has led to increasing efforts directed at deriving greater information on their basic biology, most notably through genome sequence. Accordingly, annotated sequences of all of the most important species are now available. However, full exploitation of the data generated has been hindered by the lack of mutational tools that may be used in functional genomic studies. Thus, the number of clostridial mutants generated has until recently been disappointingly small. In particular, the construction of directed mutants using classical homologous recombination-based methods has met with only limited success. Moreover, most of these few mutants were constructed by the unstable integration of a plasmid into the chromosome via a single crossover event. As an alternative, recombination-independent strategies have been devised that are reliant upon a re-targeted group II intron. One element in particular, the ClosTron, provides the facility for the positive selection of insertional mutants. The generation of mutants using the ClosTron is extremely rapid (as little as 10 days) and is highly efficient and reproducible. Furthermore, the insertions made are extremely stable. Its deployment has considerably expanded available options for clostridial functional genomic studies.
TI  - Tumor endothelial marker 5 expression in endothelial cells during capillary morphogenesis is induced by the small GTPase Rac and mediates contact inhibition of cell proliferation.
AB  - Tumor endothelial marker (TEM) 5 is an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor upregulated in endothelial cells during tumor and physiologic angiogenesis. So far, the mechanisms leading to upregulation of TEM5 and its function during angiogenesis have not been identified. Here, we report that TEM5 expression in endothelial cells is induced during capillary-like network formation on Matrigel, during capillary morphogenesis in a three-dimensional collagen I matrix, and upon confluence on a two-dimensional matrix. TEM5 expression was not induced by a variety of soluble angiogenic factors, including VEGF and bFGF, in subconfluent endothelial cells. TEM5 upregulation was blocked by toxin B from Clostridium difficile, an inhibitor of the small GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. The Rho inhibitor C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum did not affect TEM5 expression, whereas the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed TEM5 upregulation. An excess of the soluble TEM5 extracellular domain or an inhibitory monoclonal TEM5 antibody blocked contact inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation resulting in multilayered islands within the endothelial monolayer and increased vessel density during capillary formation. Based on our results we conclude that TEM5 expression during capillary morphogenesis is induced by the small GTPase Rac and mediates contact inhibition of proliferation in endothelial cells.
TI  - Clostridium difficile toxin CDT induces formation of microtubule-based protrusions and increases adherence of bacteria.
AB  - Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous  colitis by production of the Rho GTPase-glucosylating toxins A and B. Recently emerging hypervirulent Clostridium difficile strains additionally produce the binary ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDT (Clostridium difficile transferase), which ADP-ribosylates actin and inhibits actin polymerization. Thus far, the role of CDT as a virulence factor is not understood. Here we report by using time-lapse- and immunofluorescence microscopy that CDT and other binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins, including Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, induce redistribution of microtubules and formation of long (up to >150 microm) microtubule-based protrusions at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. The toxins increase the length of decoration of microtubule plus-ends by EB1/3, CLIP-170 and CLIP-115 proteins and cause redistribution of the capture proteins CLASP2 and ACF7 from microtubules at the cell cortex into the cell interior. The CDT-induced microtubule protrusions form a dense meshwork at the cell surface, which wrap and embed bacterial cells, thereby largely increasing the adherence of Clostridia. The study describes a novel type of microtubule structure caused by less efficient microtubule capture and offers a new perspective for the pathogenetic role of CDT and other binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins in host-pathogen interactions.
TI  - Phosphodiesterase 4B2 gene is an effector of Toll-like receptor signaling in astrocytes.
AB  - Cyclic AMP is part of an endogenous mechanism that downregulates inflammatory response, and its intracellular concentration is regulated chiefly by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases type 4. The goal of the present study was to determine whether phosphodiesterases 4 are involved in the inflammatory response of astrocytes mediated by Toll-like receptors. Astrocyte cultures established from newborn rat brain were challenged with lipoteichoic acid, a ligand of Toll-like receptor 2, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, a ligand of Toll-like receptor 3, or lipopolysaccharide, a ligand of Toll-like receptor 4. After 24 h the expression of genes encoding phosphodiesterase 4A, phosphodiesterase 4B and phosphodiesterase 4D was determined by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The challenge of astrocytes with the ligands profoundly up-regulated expression of the phosphodiesterase 4B mRNA, while the phosphodiesterase 4A and 4D mRNA was either unaffected or downregulated. Moreover, Toll-like receptor ligation specifically up-regulated expression of the phosphodiesterase 4B2 transcriptional variant. Thus, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid induced approximately 7-, 5- and 4-fold up-regulation of the message, respectively. Toll-like receptor ligation also led to an over 2-fold increase in the protein level of phosphodiesterase 4B2 as revealed by immunoblot analysis. The inactivation of Rho proteins by pretreatment with toxin B form C. difficile enhanced ligation-induced up-regulation of the phosphodiesterase 4B2 message by 4-9-fold. However, in spite of this increase in the message abundance, there was no increase in the protein level compared to cells challenged with the ligands alone. These results demonstrate that the phosphodiesterase 4B2 gene is an effector of Toll-like receptor signaling in astrocytes, and that its up-regulation at the protein level is controlled by complex mechanisms.
TI  - Biology and genomic analysis of Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The ability to form botulinum neurotoxin is restricted to six phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (Clostridium botulinum Groups I-IV and some strains of C. baratii and C. butyricum). The botulinum neurotoxin is the most potent toxin known, with as little as 30-100 ng potentially fatal, and is responsible for botulism, a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, animals, and birds. In order to minimize the hazards presented by the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia, it is necessary to extend understanding of the biology of these bacteria. Analyses of recently available genome sequences in conjunction with studies of bacterial physiology are beginning to reveal new and exciting information on the biology of these dangerous bacteria. At the whole organism level, substantial differences between the six botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia have been reported. For example, the genomes of proteolytic C. botulinum (C. botulinum Group I) and non-proteolytic C. botulinum (C. botulinum Group II) are highly diverged and show neither synteny nor homology. It has also emerged that the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia are not overtly pathogenic (unlike C. difficile), but saprophytic bacteria that use the neurotoxin to kill a host and create a source of nutrients. One important feature that has contributed to the success of botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia is their ability to form highly resistant endospores. The spores, however, also present an opportunity to control these bacteria if escape from lag phase (and hence growth) can be prevented. This is dependent on extending understanding of the biology of these processes. Differences in the genetics and physiology of spore germination in proteolytic C. botulinum and non-proteolytic C. botulinum have been identified. The biological variability in lag phase and its stages has been described for individual spores, and it has been shown that various adverse treatments extend different stages of lag phase. For example, heat treatment primarily extended germination, while incubation at a chilled temperature primarily extended outgrowth. The neurotoxin gene is present within a cluster of associated genes, and can be located on the chromosome, a plasmid or a bacteriophage. Two basic types of neurotoxin cluster have been identified. Evolution of the neurotoxin gene and cluster has occurred independently of the organism, and involved a series of recombination events but is still poorly understood. Factors affecting the regulation of neurotoxin formation also remain poorly understood, and will be the focus of much future research.
TI  - Rho-family GTPases modulate Ca(2+) -dependent ATP release from astrocytes.
AB  - Previously, we reported that activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) in  1321N1 human astrocytoma cells elicits a rapid release of ATP that is partially dependent on a G(q)/phophospholipase C (PLC)/Ca(2+) mobilization signaling cascade. In this study we assessed the role of Rho-family GTPase signaling as an additional pathway for the regulation of ATP release in response to activation of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPAR), and M3-muscarinic (M3R) GPCRs. Thrombin (or other PAR1 peptide agonists), LPA, and carbachol triggered quantitatively similar Ca(2+) mobilization responses, but only thrombin and LPA caused rapid accumulation of active GTP-bound Rho. The ability to elicit Rho activation correlated with the markedly higher efficacy of thrombin and LPA, relative to carbachol, as ATP secretagogues. Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which inhibit Rho-GTPases, attenuated the thrombin- and LPA-stimulated ATP release but did not decrease carbachol-stimulated release. Thus the ability of certain G(q)-coupled receptors to additionally stimulate Rho-GTPases acts to strongly potentiate a Ca(2+)-activated ATP release pathway. However, pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase I/II or myosin light chain kinase did not attenuate ATP release. PAR1-induced ATP release was also reduced twofold by brefeldin treatment suggesting the possible mobilization of Golgi-derived, ATP-containing secretory vesicles. ATP release was also markedly repressed by the gap junction channel inhibitor carbenoxolone in the absence of any obvious thrombin-induced change in membrane permeability indicative of hemichannel gating.
TI  - Binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins and their use as molecular Trojan horses for drug delivery into eukaryotic cells.
AB  - Binary bacterial toxins are unique AB-type toxins, composed of two non-linked proteins that act as a binding/translocation component and an enzyme component. All known actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins from clostridia possess this binary structure. This toxin family is comprised of the prototypical Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridium perfringens iota toxin, Clostridium difficile CDT, and Clostridium spiroforme toxin. Once in the cytosol of host cells, these toxins transfer an ADP-ribose moiety from nicotinamide-adenosine-dinucleotide onto G-actin that then leads to depolymerization of actin filaments. In recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the cellular uptake mechanism of binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins, and in particular that of C2 toxin. Both components act in a precisely concerted manner to intoxicate eukaryotic cells. The binding/translocation (B-) component forms a complex with the enzyme (A-) component and mediates toxin binding to a cell-surface receptor. Following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the enzyme component escapes from acidic endosomes into the cytosol. Acidification of endosomes triggers pore formation by the binding/translocation component in endosomal membranes and the enzyme component subsequently translocates through the pore. This step requires a host cell chaperone, Hsp90. Due to their unique structure, binary toxins are naturally "tailor made" for transporting foreign proteins into the cytosol of host cells. Several highly specific and cell-permeable recombinant fusion proteins have been designed and successfully used in experimental cell research. This review will focus on the recent progress in studying binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins as highly effective virulence factors and innovative tools for cell physiology as well as pharmacology.
TI  - Regulation of dopamine-induced Na+ current response by small G-protein RhoB or C  and phospholipase D in Aplysia neurons.
AB  - A family of GTP-binding proteins, Rho, plays critical roles in cell migration, morphological change, cytokinesis, and smooth muscle contraction. Furthermore, evidence has recently been accumulating for an involvement in regulation of receptor-operated ionic channels. We previously reported that stimulation of D1-like receptor by dopamine (DA) induces a slow Na+ current response in the identified neurons of Aplysia under voltage-clamp. To further study a regulatory mechanism of the DA-induced response, we examined possible involvement of small G-proteins and subsequent enzymes. The Na+ current response to DA was gradually and irreversibly depressed after the intracellular injection of either Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor for all Rho family G-proteins, or Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, a specific blocker for RhoA-C. Intacellular injection of active RhoA had no significant effect on the response. However, injection of GAP domain of p50RhoGAP significantly depressed the DA-induced response, while application of GEF domain of RhoGEF Dbs increased the response. In addition, either intracellular injection of alpha-synuclein or extracellular application of 1-butanol, inhibitors for phospholipase D (PLD), significantly depressed the DA-induced response. These results suggest that the DA-induced Na+ current response may be facilitated by the activation of Rho family G-protein RhoB or C but not RhoA, and subsequent PLD.
TI  - Yersinia controls type III effector delivery into host cells by modulating Rho activity.
AB  - Yersinia pseudotuberculosis binds to beta1 integrin receptors, and uses the type  III secretion proteins YopB and YopD to introduce pores and to translocate Yop effectors directly into host cells. Y. pseudotuberculosis lacking effectors that inhibit Rho GTPases, YopE and YopT, have high pore forming activity. Here, we present evidence that Y. pseudotuberculosis selectively modulates Rho activity to induce cellular changes that control pore formation and effector translocation. Inhibition of actin polymerization decreased pore formation and YopE translocation in HeLa cells infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis. Inactivation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by treatment with Clostridium difficile toxin B inhibited pore formation and YopE translocation in infected HeLa cells. Expression of a dominant negative form of Rac did not reduce the uptake of membrane impermeable dyes in HeLa cells infected with a pore forming strain YopEHJT(-). Similarly, the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 did not decrease pore formation or translocation, although it efficiently hindered Rac-dependent bacterial uptake. In contrast, C. botulinum C3 potently reduced pore formation and translocation, implicating Rho A, B, and/or C in the control of the Yop delivery. An invasin mutant (Y. pseudotuberculosis invD911E) that binds to beta1 integrins, but inefficiently transduces signals through the receptors, was defective for YopE translocation. Interfering with the beta1 integrin signaling pathway, by inhibiting Src kinase activity, negatively affected YopE translocation. Additionally, Y. pseudotuberculosis infection activated Rho by a mechanism that was dependent on YopB and on high affinity bacteria interaction with beta1 integrin receptors. We propose that Rho activation, mediated by signals triggered by the YopB/YopD translocon and from engagement of beta1 integrin receptors, stimulates actin polymerization and activates the translocation process, and that once the Yops are translocated, the action of YopE or YopT terminate delivery of Yops and prevents pore formation.
TI  - The ClosTron: a universal gene knock-out system for the genus Clostridium.
AB  - Progress in exploiting clostridial genome information has been severely impeded by a general lack of effective methods for the directed inactivation of specific genes. Those few mutants that have been generated have been almost exclusively derived by single crossover integration of a replication-deficient or defective plasmid by homologous recombination. The mutants created are therefore unstable. Here we have adapted a mutagenesis system based on the mobile group II intron from the ltrB gene of Lactococcus lactis (Ll.ltrB) to function in clostridial hosts. Integrants are readily selected on the basis of acquisition of resistance to erythromycin, and are generated from start to finish in as little as 10 to 14 days. Unlike single crossover plasmid integrants, the mutants are extremely stable. The system has been used to make 6 mutants of Clostridium acetobutylicum and 5 of Clostridium difficile, exceeding the number of published mutants ever generated in these species. Genes have also been inactivated for the first time in Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium sporogenes, suggesting the system will be universally applicable to the genus. The procedure is highly efficient and reproducible, and should revolutionize functional genomic studies in clostridia.
TI  - Inactivation of Rho GTPases with Clostridium difficile toxin B impairs centrosomal activation of Aurora-A in G2/M transition of HeLa cells.
AB  - During G2 phase of cell cycle, centrosomes function as a scaffold for activation  of mitotic kinases. Aurora-A is first activated at late G2 phase at the centrosome, facilitates centrosome maturation, and induces activation of cyclin B-Cdk1 at the centrosome for mitotic entry. Although several molecules including HEF1 and PAK are implicated in centrosomal activation of Aurora-A, signaling pathways leading to Aurora-A activation at the centrosome, and hence mitotic commitment in vertebrate cells remains largely unknown. Here, we have used Clostridium difficile toxin B and examined the role of Rho GTPases in G2/M transition of HeLa cells. Inactivation of Rho GTPases by the toxin B treatment delayed by 2 h histone H3 phosphorylation, Cdk1/cyclin B activation, and Aurora-A activation. Furthermore, PAK activation at the centrosome that was already present before the toxin addition was significantly attenuated for 2 h by the addition of toxin B, and HEF1 accumulation at the centrosome that occurred in late G2 phase was also delayed. These results suggest that Rho GTPases function in G2/M transition of mammalian cells by mediating multiple signaling pathways converging to centrosomal activation of Aurora-A.
TI  - Genome sequence of a proteolytic (Group I) Clostridium botulinum strain Hall A and comparative analysis of the clostridial genomes.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum is a heterogeneous Gram-positive species that comprises four genetically and physiologically distinct groups of bacteria that share the ability to produce botulinum neurotoxin, the most poisonous toxin known to man, and the causative agent of botulism, a severe disease of humans and animals. We report here the complete genome sequence of a representative of Group I (proteolytic) C. botulinum (strain Hall A, ATCC 3502). The genome consists of a chromosome (3,886,916 bp) and a plasmid (16,344 bp), which carry 3650 and 19 predicted genes, respectively. Consistent with the proteolytic phenotype of this strain, the genome harbors a large number of genes encoding secreted proteases and enzymes involved in uptake and metabolism of amino acids. The genome also reveals a hitherto unknown ability of C. botulinum to degrade chitin. There is a significant lack of recently acquired DNA, indicating a stable genomic content, in strong contrast to the fluid genome of Clostridium difficile, which can form longer-term relationships with its host. Overall, the genome indicates that C. botulinum is adapted to a saprophytic lifestyle both in soil and aquatic environments. This pathogen relies on its toxin to rapidly kill a wide range of prey species, and to gain access to nutrient sources, it releases a large number of extracellular enzymes to soften and destroy rotting or decayed tissues.
TI  - Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 participate in HeLa cell invasion by group B streptococcus.
AB  - The group B streptococcus (GBS) is an important human pathogen with the ability to cause invasive disease. To do so, the bacteria must invade host cells. It has been well documented that GBS are able to invade a variety of nonphagocytic host cell types, and this process is thought to involve a number of pathogen-host cell interactions. While some of the molecular aspects of the GBS-host cell invasion process have been characterized, many events still remain unclear. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the role of the Rho-family GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 in GBS invasion into epithelial cells. The epithelial cell invasion process was modeled using HeLa 229 cell culture. Treatment of HeLa cells with 10 microM compactin, a pan-GTPase inhibitor, abolished GBS internalization, suggesting that GTPases are involved in the GBS invasion process. The addition of Toxin B or exoenzyme C3 to HeLa cells before GBS infection reduced invasion by 50%, further suggesting that the Rho-family GTPases are involved in GBS entry. Examining invasion of GBS into HeLa cells with altered genetic backgrounds was used to confirm these findings; GBS invasion into HeLa cells transiently transfected with dominant negative Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA reduced invasion by 75%, 51%, and 42%, respectively. Results of this study suggest that the Rho-family GTPases are required for efficient invasion of HeLa cells by GBS.
TI  - Upregulation of the immediate early gene product RhoB by exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium limosum and toxin B from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - ADP-ribosylation of Rho(A,B,C) by the family of exoenzyme C3-like transferases induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton based on inactivation of RhoA. No data are available on the role of RhoB in C3-treated cells. In murine fibroblasts treated with the cell-permeable exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium limosum (C3), an increase in the level of RhoB was observed. This upregulation of RhoB was based on transcriptional activation, as it was responsive to inhibition by actinomycin D and accompanied by activation of the rhoB promoter. Upregulation of RhoB was not observed in cells treated with either the actin ADP-ribosylating C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum or latrunculin B, suggesting that inactivation of Rho but not actin reorganization was required for the upregulation of RhoB. This notion was confirmed, as the Rho/Rac/Cdc42-glucosylating toxin B from Clostridium difficile (TcdB) but not the Rac/R-Ras-glucosylating variant toxin B from C. difficile strain 1470 serotype F (TcdBF) induced a strong upregulation of RhoB. Upregulation of RhoB was further observed in response to the Rac/(H-,K-,N-,R-)Ras-glucosylating lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii. The level of active, GTP-bound RhoB was increased in TcdB-treated cells compared to untreated cells (as determined by Rhotekin pull-down assay). In contrast, no active RhoB was found in C3-treated cells. RhoB-GTP was required for the TcdB-induced apoptosis (cytotoxic effect), as this effect was responsive to inhibition by C3. In conclusion, RhoB was upregulated by Rho-/Ras-inactivating toxins, as a consequence of the inactivation of either Rho(A,B,C) or (H-,K-,N-)Ras. In TcdB-treated cells, RhoB escaped its inactivation and was required for the cytotoxic effect.
TI  - Review: Clostridium difficile-associated disorders/diarrhea and Clostridium difficile colitis: the emergence of a more virulent era.
AB  
TI  - Complementation of a Clostridium perfringens spo0A mutant with wild-type spo0A from other Clostridium species.
AB  - To evaluate whether C. perfringens can be used as a model organism for studying the sporulation process in other clostridia, C. perfringens spo0A mutant IH101 was complemented with wild-type spo0A from four different Clostridium species. Wild-type spo0A from C. acetobutylicum or C. tetani, but not from C. botulinum or C. difficile, restored sporulation and enterotoxin production in IH101. The ability of spo0A from C. botulinum or C. difficile to complement the lack of spore formation in IH101 might be due, at least in part, to the low levels of spo0A transcription and Spo0A production.
TI  - TLR2 transmodulates monocyte adhesion and transmigration via Rac1- and PI3K-mediated inside-out signaling in response to Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  - We present evidence for a novel TLR2 function in transmodulating the adhesive activities of human monocytes in response to the fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in chronic periodontitis and atherosclerosis. Monocyte recruitment into the subendothelium is a crucial step in atherosclerosis, and we investigated the role of P. gingivalis fimbriae in stimulating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial migration. Fimbriae induced CD11b/CD18-dependent adhesion of human monocytes or mouse macrophages to endothelial receptor ICAM-1; these activities were inhibited by TLR2 blockade or deficiency or by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K. Moreover, this inducible adhesive activity was sensitive to the action of Clostridium difficile toxin B, but was not affected by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, pertussis toxin, or cholera toxin. Accordingly, we subsequently showed through the use of dominant negative signaling mutants of small GTPases, that Rac1 mediates the ability of fimbria-stimulated monocytes to bind ICAM-1. A dominant negative mutant of Rac1 also inhibited the lipid kinase activity of PI3K suggesting that Rac1 acts upstream of PI3K in this proadhesive pathway. Furthermore, fimbriae stimulated monocyte adhesion to HUVEC and transmigration across HUVEC monolayers; both activities required TLR2 and Rac1 signaling and were dependent upon ICAM-1 and the high-affinity state of CD11b/CD18. P. gingivalis-stimulated monocytes displayed enhanced transendothelial migration compared with monocytes stimulated with nonfimbriated isogenic mutants. Thus, P. gingivalis fimbriae activate a novel proadhesive pathway in human monocytes, involving TLR2, Rac1, PI3K, and CD11b/CD18, which may constitute a mechanistic basis linking P. gingivalis to inflammatory atherosclerotic processes.
TI  - Organization and regulation of the neurotoxin genes in Clostridium botulinum and  Clostridium tetani.
AB  - Botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins are structurally and functionally related 150 kDa proteins that are potent inhibitors of neuroexocytosis. Botulinum neurotoxin associates with non-toxic proteins to form complexes of various sizes. The botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are clustered in a DNA segment called the botulinum locus. This locus is probably located on a mobile or degenerate mobile element, which accounts for the various genomic localizations (chromosome, plasmid, phage) in different Clostridium botulinum types. The botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are organized in two polycistronic operons (ntnh-bont and ha operons) transcribed in opposite orientations. The gene that separates the two operons of the botulinum locus in C. botulinum A encodes a 21 kDa protein BotR/A, which is a positive regulator of the expression of the botulinum locus genes. Similarly, in Clostridium tetani, the gene located immediately upstream of the tetanus toxin gene, encodes a positive regulatory protein, TetR. BotR and TetR are possibly alternative sigma factors related to TxeR and UviA, which regulate C. difficile toxin and C. perfringens bacteriocin production, respectively. TxeR and UviA define a new sub-group of the sigma(70) family of RNA polymerase initiation factors. In addition, the C. botulinum genome contains predicted two-component system genes, some of which are possibly involved in regulation of toxinogenesis.
TI  - Insights in metabolism and toxin production from the complete genome sequence of  Clostridium tetani.
AB  - The decryption of prokaryotic genome sequences progresses rapidly and provides the scientific community with an enormous amount of information. Clostridial genome sequencing projects have been finished only recently, starting with the genome of the solvent-producing Clostridium acetobutylicum in 2001. A lot of attention has been devoted to the genomes of pathogenic clostridia. In 2002, the genome sequence of C. perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene, has been released. Currently in the finishing stage and prior to publication are the genomes of the foodborne botulism-causing C. botulinum and of C. difficile, the causative agent of a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Our team sequenced the genome of neuropathogenic C. tetani, a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium predominantly found in the soil. In deep wound infections it occasionally causes spastic paralysis in humans and vertebrate animals, known as tetanus disease, by the secretion of potent neurotoxin, designated tetanus toxin. The toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic membranes of interneurons of the spinal cord and the brainstem, thus preventing muscle relaxation. Fortunately, this disease is successfully controlled through immunization with tetanus toxoid, a formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin, but nevertheless, an estimated 400,000 cases still occur each year, mainly of neonatal tetanus. The World Health Organization has stated that neonatal tetanus is the second leading cause of death from vaccine preventable diseases among children worldwide. This minireview focuses on an analysis of the genome sequence of C. tetani E88, a vaccine production strain, which is a toxigenic non-sporulating variant of strain Massachusetts. The genome consists of a 2,799,250 bp chromosome encoding 2618 open reading frames. The tetanus toxin is encoded on a 74,082 kb plasmid, containing 61 genes. Additional virulence-related factors as well as an insight into the metabolic strategy of C. tetani with regard to its pathogenic phenotype will be presented. The information from other clostridial genomes by means of comparative analysis will also be explored.
TI  - Regulation of toxin and bacteriocin gene expression in Clostridium by interchangeable RNA polymerase sigma factors.
AB  - The production of major extracellular toxins by pathogenic strains of Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani and Clostridium difficile, and a bacteriocin by Clostridium perfringens is dependent on a related group of RNA polymerase sigma-factors. These sigma-factors (BotR, TetR, TcdR and UviA) were shown to be sufficiently similar that they could substitute for one another in in vitro DNA binding and run-off transcription experiments. In cells, however, the sigma-factors fell into two subclasses. BotR and TetR were able to direct transcription of their target genes in a fully reciprocal manner. Similarly, UviA and TcdR were fully interchangeable. Neither BotR nor TetR could substitute for UviA or TcdR, however, and neither UviA nor TcdR could direct transcription of the natural targets of BotR or TetR. The extent of functional interchangeability of the sigma-factors was attributed to the strong conservation of their subregion 4.2 sequences and the conserved -35 sequences of their target promoters, while restrictions on interchangeability were attributed to variations in their subregion 2.4 sequences and the target site -10 sequences. The four sigma-factors have been assigned to group 5 of the sigma(70) family and seem to have arisen from a common ancestral protein that may have co-evolved with the genes whose transcription they direct. A fifth Clostridiumsigma-factor, sigma(Y) of Clostridium acetobutylicum, resembles the TcdR family, but was not functionally interchangeable with members of this family.
TI  - Centaureidin promotes dendrite retraction of melanocytes by activating Rho.
AB  - Melanosomes synthesized within melanocytes are transferred to keratinocytes through dendrites, resulting in a constant supply of melanin to the epidermis, and this process determines skin pigmentation. During screening for inhibitors of melanosome transfer, we found a novel reagent, centaureidin, that induces significant morphological changes in normal human epidermal melanocytes and inhibits melanocyte dendrite elongation, resulting in a reduction of melanosome transfer in an in vitro melanocyte-keratinocyte co-culture system. Since members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins act as master regulators of dendrite formation, and activated Rho promotes dendrite retraction, we studied the effects of centaureidin on the small GTPases. In in vitro binding assay, centaureidin activated Rho and furthermore, a Rho inhibitor (C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme), a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y27632) and a small GTPase inhibitor (Toxin B) blocked dendrite retraction induced by centaureidin. These results suggest centaureidin could act via the Rho signaling pathway, and it may directly or indirectly activate Rho. Thus, centaureidin appears to inhibit dendrite outgrowth from melanocytes by activating Rho, resulting in the inhibition of melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes.
TI  - Regulation of toxin and bacteriocin synthesis in Clostridium species by a new subgroup of RNA polymerase sigma-factors.
AB  - Many Clostridium species are pathogenic for humans and animals, and most of the resulting diseases, such as tetanus, botulism, gas gangrene and pseudomembranous colitis, are due to the production of potent extracellular toxins. The biochemical mechanisms of action of Clostridium toxins have been extensively studied in the past ten years. However, detailed information about the regulation of toxin gene expression has only recently emerged. TcdR, BotR, TetR and UviA are now known to be related alternative RNA polymerase sigma factors that drive transcription of toxin A and toxin B genes in C. difficile, the neurotoxin genes in C. botulinum and C. tetani, and a bacteriocin gene in C. perfringens. Although the Clostridium sigma factors have some similarity to members of the ECF sigma factor group, they differ sufficiently in structure and function so that they have been assigned to a new group within the sigma(70)-family.
TI  - Role of the monomeric GTPase Rho in hematopoietic progenitor cell migration and transplantation.
AB  - To investigate the role of the monomeric guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rho on migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), we employed different clostridial toxins which inhibit the Rho family of GTPases. Pretreatment with C2I-C3, a cell-accessible C3 transferase fusion protein that targets Rho, increased chemokinetic migration of the factor-dependent multipotent cell line Factor Dependent Cell Paterson with mixed lineage differentiation potential (FDCP-mix) and of primary lineage marker-depleted HPC in vitro. In contrast, treatment with lethal toxin (LT) from Clostridium sordellii, which predominantly inactivates Rac, and with toxin B from C. difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac and Cdc42, decreased in vitro migration. When HPC pretreated with LT or toxin B were transplanted into mice, homing to the bone marrow was impaired, whereas C2I-C3 treatment did not alter HPC homing. However, in a competitive hematopoietic repopulation experiment in C57BL/6 mice, pretreatment of bone marrow cells with any of the inhibitors, including the Rho inhibitor C2I-C3, resulted in suppressed donor-type hematopoiesis. Our data indicate that whereas Rac supports HPC cell cycling, migration, short-term homing and hematopoietic regeneration, Rho coordinates down-regulation of HPC migration and is required for hematopoietic regeneration.
TI  - Genomics of clostridial pathogens: implication of extrachromosomal elements in pathogenicity.
AB  - The recently decoded genomes of the major clostridial toxin-producing pathogens Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium difficile have provided a huge amount of new sequence data. Recent studies have focused on the identification and investigation of pathogenic determinants and the regulatory events governing their expression. The sequence data revealed also the genomic background of virulence genes, as well as the contribution of extrachromosomal elements to a pathogenic phenotype. This has generated new insights in clostridial pathogenesis - and will continue to do so in the future - and has deepened our understanding of the anaerobic lifestyle of clostridial species.
TI  - Involvement of a small GTP binding protein in HIV-1 release.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence suggesting that actin binding to HIV-1 encoded proteins, or even actin dynamics themselves, might play a key role in virus budding and/or release from the infected cell. A crucial step in the reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton is the engagement of various different GTP binding proteins. We have thus studied the involvement of GTP-binding proteins in the final steps of the HIV-1 viral replication cycle. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that virus production is abolished when cellular GTP binding proteins involved in actin polymerisation are inhibited with specific toxins. CONCLUSION: We propose a new HIV budding working model whereby Gag interactions with pre-existing endosomal cellular tracks as well as with a yet non identified element of the actin polymerisation pathway are required in order to allow HIV-1 to be released from the infected cell.
TI  - Transcription activation of a UV-inducible Clostridium perfringens bacteriocin gene by a novel sigma factor.
AB  - Expression of the plasmid-encoded Clostridium perfringens gene for bacteriocin BCN5 was shown to depend in vivo and in vitro on the activity of UviA protein. UviA, also plasmid-encoded, proved to be an RNA polymerase sigma factor and was also partly autoregulatory. The uviA gene has two promoters; one provided a UviA-independent, basal level of gene expression while the stronger, UviA-dependent promoter was only utilized after the cell experienced DNA damage. As a result, BCN5 synthesis is induced by treatment with UV light or mitomycin C. UviA is related to a special class of sigma factors found to date only in Clostridium species and responsible for activating transcription of toxin genes in Clostridium difficile, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium botulinum.
TI  - BotR/A and TetR are alternative RNA polymerase sigma factors controlling the expression of the neurotoxin and associated protein genes in Clostridium botulinum type A and Clostridium tetani.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani, respectively, produce potent toxins, botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and tetanus neurotoxin (TeTx), which are responsible for severe diseases, botulism and tetanus. Neurotoxin synthesis is a regulated process in Clostridium. The genes botR/A in C. botulinum A and tetR in C. tetani positively regulate expression of BoNT/A and associated non-toxic proteins (ANTPs), as well as TeTx respectively. The botR/A gene lies in close vicinity of the two operons which contain bont/A and antps genes in C. botulinum A, and tetR immediately precedes the tetX gene in C. tetani. We show that BotR/A and TetR function as specific alternative sigma factors rather than positive regulators based on the following results: (i) BotR/A and TetR associated with target DNAs only in the presence of the RNA polymerase core enzyme (Core), (ii) BotR/A and TetR directly bound with the core enzyme, (iii) BotR/A-Core recognized -35 and -10 regions of ntnh-bont/A promoter and (iv) BotR/A and TetR triggered in vitro transcription from the target promoters. In C. botulinum A, bont/A and antps genes are transcribed as bi- and tricistronic operons controlled by BotR/A. BotR/A and TetR are seemingly related to a new subgroup of the sigma70 family that includes TcdR and UviA, which, respectively, regulate production of toxins A and B in C. difficile and bacteriocin in C. perfringens. Sequences of -35 region are highly conserved in the promoter of target toxin genes in C. botulinum, C. tetani, C. difficile and C. perfringens. Overall, a common regulation mechanism probably controls toxin gene expression in these four toxigenic clostridial species.
TI  - Binary bacterial toxins: biochemistry, biology, and applications of common Clostridium and Bacillus proteins.
AB  - Certain pathogenic species of Bacillus and Clostridium have developed unique methods for intoxicating cells that employ the classic enzymatic "A-B" paradigm for protein toxins. The binary toxins produced by B. anthracis, B. cereus, C. botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. spiroforme consist of components not physically associated in solution that are linked to various diseases in humans, animals, or insects. The "B" components are synthesized as precursors that are subsequently activated by serine-type proteases on the targeted cell surface and/or in solution. Following release of a 20-kDa N-terminal peptide, the activated "B" components form homoheptameric rings that subsequently dock with an "A" component(s) on the cell surface. By following an acidified endosomal route and translocation into the cytosol, "A" molecules disable a cell (and host organism) via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, or inactivation of signaling pathways linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. Recently, B. anthracis has gleaned much notoriety as a biowarfare/bioterrorism agent, and of primary interest has been the edema and lethal toxins, their role in anthrax, as well as the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeting these virulence factors and ultimately B. anthracis. This review comprehensively surveys the literature and discusses the similarities, as well as distinct differences, between each Clostridium and Bacillus binary toxin in terms of their biochemistry, biology, genetics, structure, and applications in science and medicine. The information may foster future studies that aid novel vaccine and drug development, as well as a better understanding of a conserved intoxication process utilized by various gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea among hospitalized Jordanian patients.
AB  - We investigated stool specimens of 400 patients at Jordan University Hospital (300 patients with clinical diarrhoea and 100 controls without diarrhoea) for the presence of Clostridium difficile or its toxin. We found a 9.7% prevalence rate of C. difficile or its toxin in stools of patients with diarrhoea. The prevalence of other potential enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. (2.3%), Shigella spp. (1.0%) and Entamoeba histolytica (2.7%), was significantly less. Prevalence of C. difficile or its toxin in controls was 3.0%. Toxin A was detected in 93.1% of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea cases using an enzyme immunoassay. Our study indicates that C. difficile-associated diarrhoea is mostly observed among hospitalized patients aged > or = 50 years, in association with antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Development of an ELISA kit using monoclonal antibody to Clostridium difficile toxin A.
AB  - AIM: To establish an ELISA kit using monoclonal antibodies against Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A. METHODS: An indirect sandwich ELISA was described using the purified rabbit monospecific antiserum as capturing antibody. After the polystyrene microtitre plates with 96 flat-bottomed wells were coated with rabbit antiserum, the wells were blocked with 100 g/L BSA in PBS-T. C. difficile toxin A or culture filtrates were added to each well and then monoclonal antibodies IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added as detecting antibody, tetramethylbenzidine was used as substrate and A450 of the stopped reacting product was recorded in an automated plate reader. RESULTS: The tested specimens included culture filtrates of 2 strains of toxigenic C. difficile, 2 strains of non-toxigenic C. difficile, 26 strains of E. coli, 2 strains of S. dysenteriae, 1 strain of Bif. infantis, 5 strains of V. cholera, 2 strains of S. typhi, 7 strains of C. botulinum, 1 strain of toxigenic C. sordllii, and 1 strain of C. butyricum. A total of 47 strains of culture filtrates were all negative except for 2 strains of toxigenic C. difficile. The detective limitation of toxin A was 0.1 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: An ELISA kit with high specificity and excellent sensitivity for the rapid detection of C. difficile toxin A was established. It will be a useful tool for diagnostic test of C. difficile toxin A.
TI  - Lysophospholipids increase ICAM-1 expression in HUVEC through a Gi- and NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism.
AB  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S-1-P) are both low molecular weight lysophospholipid (LPL) ligands that are recognized by the Edg family of G protein-coupled receptors. In endothelial cells, these two ligands activate Edg receptors, resulting in cell proliferation and cell migration. The intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) is one of many cell adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This study showed that LPA and S-1-P enhance ICAM-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This enhanced ICAM-1 expression in HUVECs was first observed at 2 h postligand treatment. Maximal expression appeared at 8 h postligand treatment, as detected by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Furthermore, the effects of S-1-P on ICAM-1 expression were shown to be concentration dependent. Prior treatment of HUVECs with pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of G(i), ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and BAY 11-7082, inhibitors of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway, or Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of Rac, prevented the enhanced effect of LPL-induced ICAM-1 expression. However, pretreatment of HUVECs with exoC3, an inhibitor of Rho, had no effect on S-1-P-enhanced ICAM-1 expression. In a static cell-cell adhesion assay system, pretreatment of LPL enhanced the adhesion between HUVECs and U-937 cells, a human mononucleated cell line. The enhanced adhesion effect could be prevented by preincubation with a functional blocking antibody against human ICAM-1. These results suggest that LPLs released by activated platelets might enhance interactions of leukocytes with the endothelium through a G(i)-, NF-kappaB-, and possibly Rac-dependent mechanism, thus facilitating wound healing and inflammation processes.
TI  - [Sudden death of twins: botulism because of contamination by pap vegetables].
AB  - Botulism is caused by the blockage of the neural transmission in the cholinergic  synapses by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) which is produced by Clostridium botulinum or other Clostridia. The classic form of botulism occurs after the ingestion of food contaminated by BoNT. The course of the infection can be asymptomatic, mild with subtle paralysis ("failure to thrive") oder severe with generalized paralysis ("floppy infant"). Infected infants can also die sudden and unexpectedly. These deaths often are attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), unless a thorough postmortem examination reveals Botulism. The rate of fatal Botulism falsely attributed to SIDS is not known, because it is difficult in most cases to show the causal relationship between contamination, disease and death. We report the sudden and unexpected simultaneous death of twins of 22 months which could be attributed to Botulism. Contamination of food, colonization of the gut by Clostridia and infection with specific pathomorphological changes could be proven. The initial suspicion of infanticide could be excluded. lt could be shown, that Botulism is a potential cause of simultaneous unexpected deaths in twins.
TI  - Mechanisms of internalization and recycling of the chemokine receptor, CCR5.
AB  - CCR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds several natural chemokines but it is also a coreceptor for the entry of M tropic strains of HIV-1 into cells. Levels of CCR5 on the cell surface are important for the rate of HIV-1 infection and are determined by a number of factors including the rates of CCR5 internalization and recycling. Here we investigated the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in the control of ligand-induced internalization and recycling of CCR5. Cytochalasin D, an actin depolymerizing agent, inhibited chemokine-induced internalization of CCR5 and recycling of the receptor in stably transfected CHO cells and in the monocytic cell line, THP-1. CCR5 internalization and recycling were inhibited by Toxin B and C(3) exoenzyme treatment in CHO and THP-1 cells, confirming activation of members of the RhoGTPase family by CCR5. The specific Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632, however, had no effect on CCR5 internalization or recycling. Ligand-induced activation of CCR5 leads to Rho kinase-dependent formation of focal adhesion complexes. These data indicate that CCR5 internalization and recycling are regulated by actin polymerization and activation of small G proteins in a Rho-dependent manner.
TI  - The role of rho and rho-dependent kinase in serotonin-induced contraction observed in bovine middle cerebral artery.
AB  - The current study was designed to characterize the role of Rho and Rho-dependent  kinase (Rho-kinase) in isometric contractile responses induced by serotonin (5-HT) and a solution containing 40 mM K(+) (high K(+)) in ring preparations of the middle cerebral artery of bovine. Application of W-7, a Ca(2+)-calmodulin inhibitor, reversibly and equally attenuated the amplitudes of contractions produced by both 5-HT and high K(+). Similar effects were observed with ML-7, an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase. Surprisingly, the protein kinase C inhibitors, calphostin C and Ro-31-8220, had no effect on the 5-HT-induced contraction. Incubation of preparations with Clostridium difficile toxin A and B or with Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme for 48 hours attenuated the 5-HT-induced response but not the high K(+)-induced response. Application of the Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, resulted in marked inhibition of the 5-HT-induced response but had negligible effect on the high K(+)-induced response. These results suggest that the activation of Rho and Rho-kinase may be involved in the generation of the contraction produced by 5-HT in the bovine middle cerebral artery, while protein kinase C plays, if any, an insignificant role on the contraction.
TI  - The small GTP-binding protein RhoA regulates serotonin-induced Na+-current response in the neurons of Aplysia.
AB  - Application of serotonin (5-HT) induces a slow inward current response in identified neurons of Aplysia ganglia under voltage clamp. The 5-HT-induced current response was depressed in Na+-free media, but augmented in Ca2+-free media, and unaffected by a change in external K+. The 5-HT-induced response was markedly blocked by intracellular injection of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPbetaS). After the injection of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS), the responses to 5-HT gradually and significantly increased at the initial period, reached its plateau, and finally decreased. Intracellular injection of Clostridium difficile toxin B, a blocker of small G-protein Rho family members such as Rho (RhoA, RhoB and RhoC), Rac and Cdc42, markedly depressed the 5-HT-induced response. Intracellular injection of Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, a specific blocker of RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, exhibited a similar depressing effect observed with toxin B. In contrast, intracellular injection of recombinant L63RhoA, a constitutively active form of RhoA, significantly augmented the 5-HT-induced response without affecting the resting membrane. These results suggested that the 5-HT-induced Na+-current response might be facilitated by the activation of Aplysia Rho which is closely homologous to RhoA, RhoB or RhoC in mammalian neuron.
TI  - Involvement of Cdc42 signaling in apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux.
AB  - Cholesterol efflux, an important mechanism by which high density lipoproteins (HDL) protect against atherosclerosis, is initiated by docking of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a major HDL protein, to specific binding sites followed by activation of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and translocation of cholesterol from intracellular compartments to the exofacial monolayer of the plasma membrane where it is accessible to HDL. In this report, we investigated potential signal transduction pathways that may link apoA-I binding to cholesterol translocation to the plasma membrane and cholesterol efflux. By using pull-down assays we found that apoA-I substantially increased the amount of activated Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho in human fibroblasts. Moreover, apoA-I induced actin polymerization, which is known to be controlled by Rho family G proteins. Inhibition of Cdc42 and Rac1 with Clostridium difficile toxin B inhibited apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas inhibition of Rho with Clostridium botulinum C3-exoenzyme exerted opposite effects. Adenoviral expression of a Cdc42(T17N) dominant negative mutant substantially reduced apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas dominant negative Rac1(T17N) had no effect. We further found that two downstream effectors of Cdc42/Rac1 signaling, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), are activated by apoA-I. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK but not p38 MAPK decreased apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas anisomycin and hydrogen peroxide, two direct JNK activators, could partially substitute for apoA-I in its ability to induce cholesterol efflux. These results for the first time demonstrate activation of Rho family G proteins and stress kinases by apoA-I and implicate the involvement of Cdc42 and JNK in the apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux.
TI  - Modulation of the expression of connective tissue growth factor by alterations of the cytoskeleton.
AB  - Modulation of the cytoskeletal architecture was shown to regulate the expression  of CTGF (connective tissue growth factor, CCN2). The microtubule disrupting agents nocodazole and colchicine strongly up-regulated CTGF expression, which was prevented upon stabilization of the microtubules by paclitaxel. As a consequence of microtubule disruption, RhoA was activated and the actin stress fibers were stabilized. Both effects were related to CTGF induction. Overexpression of constitutively active RhoA induced CTGF synthesis. Interference with RhoA signaling by simvastatin, toxinB, C3 toxin, and Y27632 prevented up-regulation of CTGF. Likewise, direct disintegration of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B interfered with nocodazole-mediated up-regulation of CTGF expression. Disassembly of actin fibers by cytochalasin D, however, unexpectedly increased CTGF expression indicating that the content of F-actin per se was not the major determinant for CTGF gene expression. Given the fact that cytochalasin D sequesters G-actin, a decrease in G-actin increased CTGF, while increased levels of G-actin corresponded to reduced CTGF expression. These data link alterations in the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton to the expression of CTGF and provide a molecular basis for the observation that CTGF is up-regulated in cells exposed to mechanical stress.
TI  - Involvement of Rho family G protein in the cell signaling for sperm incorporation during fertilization of mouse eggs: inhibition by Clostridium difficile toxin B.
AB  - Sperm-egg interaction was investigated in mouse eggs freed from the zona pellucida and injected with Clostridium difficile toxin B, the inhibitor of Rho family small G proteins. Toxin B reduced in a dose-dependent manner the percentage of eggs associated with sperm fusion on the surface or sperm nucleus decondensation in the ooplasm, examined by injection of a DNA-staining dye into the egg and transfer of the dye to the fused sperm head after recording intracellular Ca(2+) responses for 100 min postinsemination. The mean number of decondensed sperm nuclei per egg was remarkably decreased by approximately 1 microg/ml toxin B in the ooplasm. This was because spermatozoa were arrested at the fusion state without developing to sperm incorporation and tended to lose cytoplasmic continuity to the egg. The fusion-arrested spermatozoa caused transient small Ca(2+) oscillations in most of eggs, while an injected spermatozoon produced repetitive large Ca(2+) spikes unaffected by toxin B. A decrease in the rate of fused spermatozoa and decondensed sperm nuclei was also caused by 20-40 microM cytochalasin D, the inhibitor of actin polymerization. Immunostaining of Rho proteins showed that Rac1 and RhoB are present in the cortical ooplasm, but Cdc42 is absent. Actin filaments in the cortex appeared to be reduced in toxin B-injected eggs. This study suggests that Rho protein(s) regulating actin-based cytoskeletal reorganization is involved in the process leading to sperm incorporation.
TI  - The host cell chaperone Hsp90 is essential for translocation of the binary Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin into the cytosol.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin is the prototype of the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins and consists of the binding component C2II and the enzyme component C2I. The activated binding component C2IIa forms heptamers, which bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface and interact with the enzyme component C2I. This toxin complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In acidic endosomes, heptameric C2IIa forms pores and mediates the translocation of C2I into the cytosol. We report that the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90-specific inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol, block intoxication of Vero cells, rat astrocytes, and HeLa cells by C2 toxin. ADP-ribosylation of actin in the cytosol of toxin-treated cells revealed that less active C2I was translocated into the cytosol after treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. Under control conditions, C2I was localized in the cytosol of toxin-treated rat astrocytes, whereas geldanamycin blocked the cytosolic distribution of C2I. At low extracellular pH (pH 4.5), which allows the direct translocation of C2I via C2IIa heptamers across the cell membrane into the cytosol, Hsp90 inhibitors retarded intoxication by C2I. Geldanamycin did not affect toxin binding, endocytosis, and pore formation by C2IIa. The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of C2I was not affected by Hsp90 inhibitors in vitro. The cytotoxic actions of the actin-ADP-ribosylating Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C2-C3 fusion toxin was similarly blocked by Hsp90 inhibitors. In contrast, radicicol and geldanamycin had no effect on anthrax lethal toxin-induced cytotoxicity of J774-A1 macrophage-like cells or on cytotoxic effects of the glucosylating Clostridium difficile toxin B in Vero cells. The data indicate that Hsp90 is essential for the membrane translocation of ADP-ribosylating toxins delivered by C2II.
TI  - cAMP-induced AQP2 translocation is associated with RhoA inhibition through RhoA phosphorylation and interaction with RhoGDI.
AB  - We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of Rho GTPase with Clostridium difficile toxin B, or with Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin, causes actin depolymerization and translocation of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) in renal CD8 cells in the absence of hormonal stimulation. Here we demonstrate that Rho inhibition is part of the signal transduction cascade activated by vasopressin leading to AQP2 insertion into the apical membrane. Quantitation of active RhoA (GTP-bound) by selective pull down experiments demonstrated that the amount of active RhoA decreased upon stimulation of CD8 cells with the cAMP-elevating agent forskolin. Consistent with this observation, forskolin treatment resulted in a decreased expression of membrane-associated (active) Rho, as assessed by cell fractionation followed by western blotting analysis. In addition, the abundance of the endogenous Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI) was found to have decreased in the membrane fraction after forskolin stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that, after forskolin stimulation, the amount of Rho-GDI complexed with RhoA increased, suggesting that Rho GTPase inhibition occurs through association of RhoA with Rho-GDI. Finally, forskolin stimulation was associated with an increase in Rho phosphorylation on a serine residue, a protein modification known to stabilize the inactive form of RhoA and to increase its interaction with Rho-GDI. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RhoA inhibition through Rho phosphorylation and interaction with Rho-GDI is a key event for cytoskeletal dynamics controlling cAMP-induced AQP2 translocation.
TI  - Pitavastatin-induced thrombomodulin expression by endothelial cells acts via inhibition of small G proteins of the Rho family.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) can function to protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of their lipid-lowering activity. The main feature of the antithrombotic properties of endothelial cells is an increase in the expression of thrombomodulin (TM) without induction of tissue factor (TF) expression. We investigated the effect of statins on the expression of TM and TF by endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: The incubation of endothelial cells with pitavastatin led to a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cellular TM antigen and mRNA levels. In contrast, the expression of TF mRNA was not induced under the same conditions. A nuclear run-on study revealed that pitavastatin accelerates TM transcription rate. The stimulation of TM expression by pitavastatin was prevented by either mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Specific inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase-I and Rac/Cdc42 by GGTI-286 and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, respectively, enhanced TM expression, whereas inactivation of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme was ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Statins regulate TM expression via inhibition of small G proteins of the Rho family; Rac/Cdc42. A statin-mediated increase in TM expression by endothelial cells may contribute to the beneficial effects of statins on endothelial function.
TI  - A case if infant botulism due to neurotoxigenic Clostridium butyricum type E associated with Clostridium difficile colitis.
AB  - Reported here is the sixth case of intestinal toxemia botulism caused by Clostridium butyricum type E in Italy since 1984. In this case, the patient was concomitantly affected with colitis due to Clostridium difficile toxin. A review of previously reported cases revealed that some of these patients may also have had intestinal toxemia botulism associated with Clostridium difficile colitis, based on the reported symptoms. Given that this association has been shown to exist not only in Italy but also in the USA, it is recommended that individuals with intestinal botulism and symptoms of colitis undergo testing for Clostridium difficile and its toxins in fecal samples.
TI  - The uptake machinery of clostridial actin ADP-ribosylating toxins--a cell delivery system for fusion proteins and polypeptide drugs.
AB  - Several bacterial protein toxins, including Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, Clostridum perfringens iota toxin, Clostridium difficile ADP-ribosyltransferase, and the Bacillus-produced vegetative insecticidal proteins, target the cytoskeleton by ADP-ribosylation of actin. All these toxins are binary in structure and consist of an enzyme component, possessing ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and a separated binding and translocation component, which is involved in the delivery of the enzyme component into the cell. The toxins are not only important virulence factors but also cell biological tools to study the function of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, the binary toxins turned out to be effective transporter systems for the delivery of specific fusion toxins (e.g., Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme) into cells. The present review describes the biological functions of the toxins, focuses on recent studies on the uptake and delivery mechanism and discusses the usage as a drug delivery system.
TI  - Rho protein inactivation induced apoptosis of cultured human endothelial cells.
AB  - Small GTP-binding Rho GTPases regulate important signaling pathways in endothelial cells, but little is known about their role in endothelial cell apoptosis. Clostridial cytotoxins specifically inactivate GTPases by glucosylation [Clostridium difficile toxin B-10463 (TcdB-10463), C. difficile toxin B-1470 (TcdB-1470)] or ADP ribosylation (C. botulinum C3 toxin). Exposure of human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to TcdB-10463, which inhibits RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42, or to C3 toxin, which inhibits RhoA, -B, -C, resulted in apoptosis, whereas inactivation of Rac1/Cdc42 with TcdB-1470 was without effect, suggesting that Rho inhibition was responsible for endothelial apoptosis. Disruption of endothelial microfilaments as well as inhibition of p160ROCK did not induce endothelial apoptosis. Exposure to TcdB-10463 resulted in activation of caspase-9 and -3 but not caspase-8 in HUVEC. Moreover, Rho inhibition reduced expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased proapoptotic Bid but had no effect on Bax or FLIP protein levels. Caspase-3 activity and apoptosis induced by TcdB-10463 were abolished by cAMP elevation. In summary, inhibition of Rho in endothelial cells activates caspase-9- and -3-dependent apoptosis, which can be antagonized by cAMP elevation.
TI  - Reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) related nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation but not inhibitor kappa-B (Ikappa-B)-degradation by Rho protein inhibition in human endothelial cells.
AB  - Degradation of inhibitor kappa-B (Ikappa-B) followed by translocation of nuclear  factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) into the nucleus and activation of gene expression is essential in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-signaling. In order to analyze the role of Rho proteins in TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB-activation in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) we used Clostridium difficile toxin B-10463 (TcdB-10463) which inactivates RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42 by glucosylation and Clostridium botulinum C3-toxin which inhibits RhoA/B/C by ADP-ribosylation. Exposure of HUVEC to 10 ng/mL TcdB-10463 or 2.5 microg/mL C3-toxin inhibited TNF-alpha (100 ng/mL)-induced expression of a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene. Moreover, preincubation of HUVEC with 10 ng/mL TcdB-10463 reduced TNF-alpha-related expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), TNF-receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2), and human inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (hIAP1)-mRNA. Blocking of Rho reduced NF-kappaB DNA-binding as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. TcdB-10463 and C3-toxin blocked TNF-alpha-related nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB although Ikappa-Balpha/beta was still degraded. In contrast, TcdB-10463 had no effect on IL-1beta-related NF-kappaB-translocation and activation in HUVEC. Neither 1 microM Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 nor microfilament depolymerization by 50 ng/mL C. botulinum C2-toxin blocked TNF-alpha-induced degradation of Ikappa-B, nuclear NF-kappaB translocation or expression of a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene. Therefore, TNF-alpha-related Ikappa-B-degradation is Rho-independent in HUVEC, whereas a Rho protein-dependent signal is necessary to induce nuclear transport of NF-kappaB in these cells pointing to a novel and unique role of Rho in NF-kappaB-translocation.
TI  - Molecular characterization of phenyllactate dehydratase and its initiator from Clostridium sporogenes.
AB  - The heterotrimeric phenyllactate dehydratase from Clostridium sporogenes, FldABC, catalyses the reversible dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate in two steps: (i) CoA-transfer from the cofactor cinnamoyl-CoA to phenyllactate to yield phenyllactyl-CoA and the product cinnamate mediated by FldA, a (R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase; followed by (ii) dehydration of phenyllactyl-CoA to cinnamoyl-CoA mediated by heterodimeric FldBC, a phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase. Phenyllactate dehydratase requires initiation by ATP, MgCl2 and a reducing agent such as dithionite mediated by an extremely oxygen-sensitive initiator protein (FldI) present in the cell-free extract. All four genes coding for these proteins were cloned and shown to be clustered in the order fldAIBC, which shares over 95% sequence identity of nucleotide and protein levels with a gene cluster detected in the genome of the closely related Clostridium botulinum Hall strain A. FldA shows sequence similarities to a new family of CoA-transferases, which apparently do not form covalent enzyme CoA-ester intermediates. An N-terminal Strep II-Tag containing enzymatically active FldI was overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli. FldI was characterized as a homodimeric protein, which contains one [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ cluster with an electron spin S = 3/2 in the reduced form. The amino acid sequence as well as the chemical and EPR-properties of the pure protein are very similar to those of component A of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans (HgdC), which was able to replace FldI in the activation of phenyllactate dehydratase. Only in the oxidized state, FldI and component A exhibit significant ATPase activity, which appears to be essential for unidirectional electron transfer. Both subunits of phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase (FldBC) show significant sequence similarities to both subunits of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HgdAB). The fldAIBC gene cluster resembles the hadAIBC gene cluster in the genome of Clostridium difficile and the hadABC,I genes in C. botulinum. The four subunits of these deduced 2-hydroxyacid dehydratases (65-81% amino acid sequence identity between the had genes) probably code for a 2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydratase involved in leucine fermentation. This enzyme could be the target for metronidazole in the treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by C. difficile.
TI  - Interaction of the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme with RalA.
AB  - RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by Clostridium  botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases. We report that RalA GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus (C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant (K(d)) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA.
TI  - Preferential initiation of PC12 neurites in directions of changing substrate adhesivity.
AB  - When PC12 cells are grown on substrates showing a gradient of nonspecific adhesion, they preferentially initiate neurites in directions of changing adhesivity, whether that change is in the direction of increasing or decreasing adhesivity. This preference for changing adhesivity is ablated both by C. difficile toxin A, which inhibits all Rho-family GTPases, and by C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inhibits Rho.
TI  - Bacterial protein toxins inhibiting low-molecular-mass GTP-binding proteins.
AB  - The Rho GTPases, which belong to the Ras superfamily of low-molecular-mass GTP-binding proteins, are the preferred intracellular targets of bacterial protein toxins. The Rho GTPases RhoA/B/C, Rac1/2 and Cdc42 are the master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, the causative agents of the antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, are intracellularly acting cytotoxins which mono-glucosylate the Rho GTPases. Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin, which is not related to the clostridial neurotoxins, catalyses ADP-ribosylation of RhoA/B/C but not of other Rho GTPases. Glucosylation as well as ADP-ribosylation result in functional inactivation of Rho causing disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton.
TI  - Characterization of the enzymatic component of the ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin CDTa from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Certain strains of Clostridium difficile produce the ADP-ribosyltransferase CDT,  which is a binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxin. The toxin consists of the binding component CDTb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component CDTa. Here we studied the enzyme component (CDTa) of the toxin using the binding component of Clostridium perfringens iota toxin (Ib), which is interchangeable with CDTb as a transport component. Ib was used because CDTb was not expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Similar to iota toxin, CDTa ADP-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. The N-terminal part of CDTa (CDTa1-240) competes with full-length CDTa for binding to the iota toxin binding component. The C-terminal part (CDTa244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length CDTa. Changes of Glu428 and Glu430 to glutamine, Ser388 to alanine, and Arg345 to lysine blocked ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Comparison of CDTa with C. perfringens iota toxin and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment Ia208-413 but loss of activity of several N-terminally deleted C2I proteins including C2I103-431, C2I190-431, and C2I30-431. The data indicate that CDTa belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxins with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. It shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and C2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in NAD-binding and/or catalytic activity. The enzyme components of CDT, iota toxin, and C2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.
TI  - An essential role for Rac/Cdc42 GTPases in cerebellar granule neuron survival.
AB  - Rho family GTPases are critical molecular switches that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell function. In the current study, we investigated the involvement of Rho GTPases in regulating neuronal survival using primary cerebellar granule neurons. Clostridium difficile toxin B, a specific inhibitor of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, induced apoptosis of granule neurons characterized by c-Jun phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, and nuclear condensation. Serum and depolarization-dependent survival signals could not compensate for the loss of GTPase function. Unlike trophic factor withdrawal, toxin B did not affect the antiapoptotic kinase Akt or its target glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. The proapoptotic effects of toxin B were mimicked by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, a selective inhibitor of Rac/Cdc42. Although Rac/Cdc42 GTPase inhibition led to F-actin disruption, direct cytoskeletal disassembly with Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin was insufficient to induce c-Jun phosphorylation or apoptosis. Granule neurons expressed high basal JNK and low p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activities that were unaffected by toxin B. However, pyridyl imidazole inhibitors of JNK/p38 attenuated c-Jun phosphorylation. Moreover, both pyridyl imidazoles and adenoviral dominant-negative c-Jun attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that JNK/c-Jun signaling was required for cell death. The results indicate that Rac/Cdc42 GTPases, in addition to trophic factors, are critical for survival of cerebellar granule neurons.
TI  - Regulation by rho family GTPases of IL-1 receptor induced signaling: C3-like chimeric toxin and Clostridium difficile toxin B inhibit signaling pathways involved in IL-2 gene expression.
AB  - In this study the participation of Rho family GTPases in the regulation of IL-1-activated protein kinase cascades controlling IL-2 synthesis was investigated in murine EL-4 thymoma cells. The recombinant C3-like chimeric toxin, which consists of the C3 toxin of Clostridium limosum and the N-terminal part of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin (C2IN-C3) interacting with the C2II binding subunit to facilitate uptake into cells, and selectively inactivates Rho A by ADP-ribosylation, prevented IL-1-stimulated activation of Jun-NH2-terminal-kinases (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated-protein kinases (MAPK). UDP-monoglucosylation and concomitant inactivation of Rho A and of Rac-2 by Clostridium difficile toxin B also inhibited IL-1-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAPK, but additionally inhibited activation of the extracellular-regulated-kinase pathway and DNA binding of the transcription factor NFkappaB. Accordingly, pre-treatment of cells with C21N-C3 fusion toxin only decreased IL-1-stimulated IL-2 synthesis by 50%, while in C. difficile toxin B-treated cells IL-1-induced IL-2 secretion was reduced by 90%. These results imply that together with Rho A an additional member of the Rho family G proteins, i.e. Rac-2, is critically involved as an upstream regulator in IL-1-induced activation of different MAPK, stress-activated protein kinases, and in NFkappaB activation controlling IL-2 gene expression in response to IL-1, acting in close proximity to the IL-1-receptor complex.
TI  - The effect of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in Clostridium difficile toxin-induced paw oedema and neutrophil migration.
AB  - Clostridium difficile produces a potent enterotoxin and a cytotoxin, toxin A and  toxin B, respectively. These toxins are associated with pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. In the present study, we investigated the oedematogenic activity of both toxins, characterizing the time-course and dose-response of this pro-inflammatory event. We also explored the effects of two inhibitors of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production, thalidomide and pentoxifylline, in neutrophil recruitment and the oedematogenic activity of these toxins. Subplantar injection of toxin A induced paw oedema with a maximal response at 1 microg, reaching a maximal value 9 hr after toxin A challenge (toxin A 1 microg:1.39+/-0.09 ml). Toxin B also showed a dose-dependent oedematogenic activity with a late peak at 24 hr and a maximal response at a dose of 0.1 microg (toxin B 0.1 microg:1.74+/-0.12 ml). Pentoxifylline, but not thalidomide, significantly reduced the oedema induced by Toxin A (pentoxifylline 135 mg/kg:60% of inhibition) and Toxin B (pentoxifylline 135 mg/kg:33.6% of inhibition). Both thalidomide and pentoxifylline were able to significantly reduce neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavities of rats evoked with Toxin A (thalidomide 45 mg/kg: 53.1% of inhibition; pentoxifylline 45 mg/kg:47.1% of inhibition) and Toxin B (thalidomide 45 mg/kg:46.8% of inhibition; pentoxifylline 45 mg/kg:63.1% of inhibition). This study demonstrates the oedematogenic activities of both toxins with distinct potencies and time-courses. These data also show an inhibitory effect of pentoxifylline in toxin A and B-induced paw oedema. Furthermore, both pentoxifylline and thalidomide significantly inhibited the Clostridium difficile toxins-induced neutrophil migration.
TI  - Delivery of proteins into living cells by reversible membrane permeabilization with streptolysin-O.
AB  - The pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO) can be used to reversibly permeabilize adherent and nonadherent cells, allowing delivery of molecules with up to 100 kDa mass to the cytosol. Using FITC-labeled albumin, 10(5)-10(6) molecules were estimated to be entrapped per cell. Repair of toxin lesions depended on Ca(2+)-calmodulin and on intact microtubules, but was not sensitive to actin disruption or to inhibition of protein synthesis. Resealed cells were viable for days and retained the capacity to endocytose and to proliferate. The active domains of large clostridial toxins were introduced into three different cell lines. The domains were derived from Clostridium difficile B-toxin and Clostridium sordelli lethal toxin, which glycosylate small G-proteins, and from Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, which ADP-ribosylates actin. After delivery with SLO, all three toxins disrupted the actin cytoskeleton to cause rounding up of the cells. Glucosylation assays demonstrated that G-proteins Rho and Ras were retained in the permeabilized cells and were modified by the respective toxins. Inactivation of these G-proteins resulted in reduced stimulus-dependent granule secretion, whereas ADP-ribosylation of actin by the C. botulinum C2-toxin resulted in enhanced secretion in cells. The presented method for introducing proteins into living cells should find multifaceted application in cell biology.
TI  - Bacterial inhibition of phagocytosis.
AB  - The concerted study of molecular mechanisms of phagocytosis and the inhibition of phagocytosis by specific products of extracellular bacterial pathogens has borne considerable fruit. The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation and of the Rho family of GTPases has become clear to cell biologists, but pathogenic bacteria recognized the importance of these signalling pathways in phagocytic cells long ago. The discoveries described in this review are only the beginning. The simultaneous pursuit of the mechanisms and molecules involved in the initiation and regulation of phagocytosis and that pathogenic bacteria use to inhibit phagocytosis will surely identify more interesting pathways on each side of the contest. Are there any obvious possibilities? There are several bacterial factors that have the potential to inhibit known mechanisms of phagocytosis. Clostridium species, for example, make a number of exotoxins of interest. Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani neurotoxins inactivate the regulated secretory machinery by proteolytic cleavage of SNARE proteins, and targets of tetanus toxin and botulinum b toxin inhibit the exocytotic delivery of membrane vesicles needed for phagocytosis of large particles (Hackam et al., 1998). Moreover, the C3 exotoxin of C. botulinum catalyses ADP ribosylation and inactivation of rho family GTPases (Wiegers et al., 1991), and toxins A and B of C. difficile UDP-glucosylate and inactivate rho GTPases and thereby disrupt the actin cytoskeleton (Just et al., 1995a,b). However, as Clostridia lack the machinery for type III secretion, these proteins are not rapidly targeted to the phagocyte cytoplasm. More searching may reveal a pathogen that has combined the type III secretory machinery with clostridia toxin-like substrates. A potentially unique strategy for remaining outside phagocytes is exhibited by Helicobacter pylori, which contain a type IV secretion system. Unopsonized virulent strains of H. pylori bind readily to macrophages but are only internalized after a delay of several minutes. Such a delay appears to be sufficient for the bacteria to remain extracellular (Allen et al., 2000). Elucidation of the mechanism used by H. pylori to delay phagocytosis may reveal one or more novel virulence factors as well as one or more novel targets in the phagocyte that will add to the understanding of a fundamental process in host defence. Another field ripe for further mechanistic investigation is complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Dedicated study of the molecular events and molecular mediators of phagocytosis downstream of CR3 is likely to reveal interesting differences from FcgammaR phagocytosis and is just as likely to reveal that microbes have discovered unique mechanisms for circumventing them. Study of extracellular pathogens and the mechanisms that they use to remain outside phagocytic cells has revealed a great deal about the initial encounter between pathogen and phagocyte. We can look forward to additional discoveries about the host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms and factors that each side uses to battle against the other.
TI  - Bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  - Numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. The clostridial binary toxins (Iota and C2 families) ADP-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. The large clostridial toxins from Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the Rho family that regulate actin polymerization. In contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from Escherichia coli activates Rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. The enterotoxin of Bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for E-cadherin and it promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The bacterial toxins that modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.
TI  - Evidence for Rho protein regulation of renal tubular epithelial cell function.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rho proteins are small guanine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins felt to be important regulators of several aspects of cell function, including the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The effects of Rho proteins on the regulation of renal tubular epithelial cell function are not known. METHODS: Selected bacterial toxins that inhibit Rho protein function were used to examine the effect of Rho in cultured renal tubular epithelial cells. RESULTS: Clostridium difficile toxin A significantly and dose dependently inhibited LLC-PK(1) cell (3)H-thymidine uptake and healing of small wounds made in confluent monolayers, and it induced apoptosis. A second Clostridium difficile toxin (toxin B) that acted via a different receptor also impaired LLC-PK(1) thymidine uptake and wound healing, and it induced apoptosis. A third bacterial toxin, C3 toxin from Clostridium botulinum, also impaired LLC-PK(1) thymidine uptake and stimulated apoptosis in LLC-PK(1) cells. Since Rho inhibition disrupted organization of the actin cytoskeleton, we examined the effects of another agent that disrupted the actin cytoskeleton (cytochalasin D) and found significant dose-dependent effects that impaired LLC-PK1 thymidine uptake and wound healing and that induced apoptosis. The effects of toxin A and cytochalasin D to induce apoptosis were not associated with significant changes in expression of Bcl-2, BAD, or BAK proteins and were significantly attenuated by a pancaspase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Rho proteins are important endogenous regulators of several aspects of renal tubular epithelial cell function, including proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Further studies are needed to clarify the cellular mechanisms of Rho regulation of renal epithelial cell function.
TI  - [Detection of toxin-producing pathogenic bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of pathogenic Clostridium  botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli. With this aim in view, primers to botulinic toxins types A, B, C1, D, E, F, and G, perfringens enterotoxin, difficile toxin, and types 1 and 2 Shigella-like toxins were chosen and synthesized. Optimal amplification conditions were selected for each pair of primers, with DNA and the respective agent as the reaction mixture matrices. PCR was highly specific and sensitive in all cases. Its sensitivity was 10-100 cells/sample. Among the tested C. botulinum, C. perfringens, C. difficile, and E. coli strains, specific amplification products of expected size were observed only in the strains containing the respective toxin genes. These findings recommend the use of these methods in clinical microbiology. Strains containing type 2 Shigella-like toxin gene were detected among E. coli strains isolated from patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome, which for the first time indicates that the problem with E. coli epidemic strain O157 is valid for Russia. As a result of our studies, test systems for detection of types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G C. botulinum strains, C. perfringens and C. difficile, and E. coli O157 strains are now available.
TI  - Activation of MMP-2 by Clostridium difficile toxin B in bovine smooth muscle cells.
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) plays critical roles in cell migration through the breakdown of the extracellular matrix. Cell movements require dynamic actin reorganization, which is controlled by Rho family GTPases. In order to examine the relation between MMP-2 regulation and actin reorganization, we used several inhibitors of Rho family GTPases. Treatment of smooth muscle cells with Clostridium difficile toxin B known to inactivate Rho family GTPases activated MMP-2. However, neither C3 transferase, a Rho inhibitor, nor Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase, induced MMP-2 activation. Treatment with C3 transferase and Y-27632 caused morphological changes into the round and stellate shape, respectively, by inhibition of actin stress fiber formation. In addition, toxin B treatment induced expression and processing of MT1-MMP, a major activator of MMP-2. Taken together, we suggest the involvement of Rho family GTPases, although inhibition of neither Rho nor Rho-kinase is sufficient, in the activation of MMP-2 through expression and activation of MT1-MMP.
TI  - Inhibition of Rho protein stimulates iNOS expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.
AB  - Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is upregulated in arterial injury and plays a role in regulating VSMC proliferation and restenosis. Inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)] released during vascular injury induce iNOS. Small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily play a major role in IL-1beta-dependent signaling pathways. In this study, we examined the role of Rho GTPases in regulating iNOS expression in VSMCs. Treatment of VSMCs with mevastatin, which inhibits isoprenylation of Rho and other small GTP-binding proteins, produced significantly higher amounts of IL-1beta-evoked NO and iNOS protein compared with control. Similarly, bacterial toxins [Toxin B from Clostridium difficile and C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase (C3) toxin from Clostridium botulinium] that specifically inactivate Rho proteins increased NOS products (NO and citrulline) and iNOS expression. Toxin B increased the activity of iNOS promoter-reporter construct in VSMCs. Both toxins enhanced IL-1beta-stimulated iNOS expression and NO production. These data demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of Rho induces iNOS and suggest a role for Rho protein in IL-1beta-stimulated NO production in VSMCs.
TI  - A role for the small molecular weight GTPases, Rho and Cdc42, in muscarinic receptor signaling to focal adhesion kinase.
AB  - An enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is elicited during neuronal growth cone remodeling and requires the maintenance of agonist-sensitive pools of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Rho family GTPases are putative regulators of both PIP2 synthesis and growth cone remodeling, including neurite outgrowth elicited by muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) stimulation. In this study, we investigated the interrelationships among Rho family GTPases, PIP2 synthesis, and mAChR signaling to FAK in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Preincubation with Clostridium difficile toxin B (Tox B), an inhibitor of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, attenuated mAChR-stimulated FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced FAK phosphorylation to a similar extent (75% decreases at 200 pg/ml Tox B) but did not affect mitogen-activated protein kinase activation elicited by either phorbol ester or an mAChR agonist. In contrast, preincubation with selective inhibitors of either Rho (C3 exoenzyme) or Rho kinase (HA-1 077) resulted in 80-90% reductions in LPA-induced FAK phosphorylation but only 40-50% decreases in mAChR-stimulated phosphorylation. Moreover, mAChR-mediated FAK phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in cells scrape-loaded with dominant-negative N17Cdc42 but not N17Rac1. Tox B had little or no effect on agonist-sensitive pools of PIP2 but inhibited mAChR-driven actin cytoskeletal remodeling. The results suggest that the Rho family GTPases, Rho and Cdc42, link mAChR stimulation to increases in FAK phosphorylation independently of effects on PIP2 synthesis.
TI  - Inhibition of calcium release-activated calcium current by Rac/Cdc42-inactivating clostridial cytotoxins in RBL cells.
AB  - Using large clostridial cytotoxins as tools, the role of Rho GTPases in activation of RBL 2H3 hm1 cells was studied. Clostridium difficile toxin B, which glucosylates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which glucosylates Rac and Cdc42 but not Rho, inhibited the release of hexosaminidase from RBL cells mediated by the high affinity antigen receptor (FcepsilonRI). Additionally, toxin B and lethal toxin inhibited the intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization induced by FcepsilonRI-stimulation and thapsigargin, mainly by reducing the influx of extracellular Ca(2+). In patch clamp recordings, toxin B and lethal toxin inhibited the calcium release-activated calcium current by about 45%. Calcium release-activated calcium current, the receptor-stimulated Ca(2+) influx, and secretion were inhibited neither by the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3-fusion toxin C2IN-C3 nor by the actin-ADP-ribosylating Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin. The data indicate that Rac and Cdc42 but not Rho are not only involved in late exocytosis events but are also involved in Ca(2+) mobilization most likely by regulating the Ca(2+) influx through calcium release-activated calcium channels activated via FcepsilonRI receptor in RBL cells.
TI  - Rho family proteins modulate rapid apoptosis induced by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Fas.
AB  - Little is known about the role of Rho proteins in apoptosis produced by stimuli evolved specifically to produce apoptosis, such as granzymes from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Fas. Here we demonstrate that all three Rho family members are involved in CTL- and Fas-induced killing. Dominant-negative mutants of each Rho family member and Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of all family members, strongly inhibited the susceptibility of cells to CTL- and Fas-induced apoptosis. Fas-induced caspase-3 activation was inhibited by C. difficile toxin. Activated mutants of each GTPase increased susceptibility to apoptosis, and activation of Cdc42 increased within 5 min of Fas stimulation. In contrast, during the time required for CTL and Fas killing, no apoptosis was produced by dominant-negative or activated mutants or by C. difficile toxin alone. Inhibition of actin polymerization using latrunculin A reduced the ability of constitutively active GTPase mutants to stimulate apoptosis and blocked Fas-induced activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, the ability of Rac to enhance apoptosis was decreased by point mutations reported to block Rac induction of actin polymerization. Rho family proteins may regulate apoptosis through their effects on the actin cytoskeleton.
TI  - A Rho-related GTPase is involved in Ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter exocytosis.
AB  - Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 monomeric GTPases are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone secretion in endocrine cells. Here, we examine their possible implication in Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Using subcellular fractionation procedures, we found that RhoA, RhoB, Rac1, and Cdc42 are present in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only Rac1 was associated with highly purified synaptic vesicles. To determine the synaptic function of these GTPases, toxins that impair Rho-related proteins were microinjected into Aplysia neurons. We used lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii, which inactivates Rac; toxin B from Clostridium difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42; and C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from Escherichia coli, which mainly affect Rho. Analysis of the toxin effects on evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the Rho family, most likely Rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. Strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin B could be completely removed in <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. Further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin suggests that Rac1 protein regulates a late step in Ca(2+)-dependent neuroexocytosis.
TI  - Rho and Rac exert antagonistic functions on spreading of macrophage-derived multinucleated cells and are not required for actin fiber formation.
AB  - Multinucleated giant cells (MNGC) derived from avian blood monocytes present, like osteoclasts, an unusual cytoskeletal organization characterized by (1) cortical rings of actin filaments, (2) unique adhesion structures called podosomes and (3) vinculin containing focal complexes which are not visibly connected to F-actin structures. The Rho family of small GTPases plays an essential role in the regulation and organization of cellular cytoskeletal structures including F-actin and vinculin associated structures. Using bacterial toxins such as modified exoenzyme C3 (C3B) and toxin B or overexpression of constitutively active Rac and Rho proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), we show that Rac and Rho play antagonistic roles in regulating the morphology of osteoclast-like cells. Inhibition of Rho by C3B triggered MNGC spreading whereas activated Rho promoted cell retraction. However, inhibition or activation of Rho led to complete disorganization of fibrillar actin structures, including podosomes. Toxin B inhibition of Rho, Rac and Cdc42 induced a time dependent F-actin and vinculin reorganization. Initially, actin fibers with associated adhesion plaques formed and disappeared subsequently. Finally, only small focal complexes remained at the MNGC periphery before retracting. At the time when actin fibers formed, we observed that Rac was already inhibited by toxin B. By combining C3B treatment and overexpression of a dominant negative form of Rac (N17Rac), we show that the formation of these focal adhesion and actin fiber structures required neither Rho nor Rac activity. Moreover, our results show that podosomes are extremely unstable structures since any modifications of Rho or Rac activity resulted in their dissociation.
TI  - Bacterial toxins inhibiting or activating small GTP-binding proteins.
AB  - Amino acids located on the switch 1 or switch 2 domains of small GTPases of the Ras and Rho family are targets of several bacterial toxins. Exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosylates specifically Rho at R43 and prevents the recruitment of Rho on the cell membrane. This blocks the downstream effects of the Rho GTPase. However, exoenzyme C3 is not a toxin, and chimeric proteins fusing C3 with the B moiety of either diphtheria toxin or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A have been produced to intoxicate cells with low concentration of C3. C. difficile toxin B modifies by glucosylation Rho on T37 and Rac and Cdc42 on T35. Glucosylation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 blocks the binding of these GTPases on their downstream effectors. C. sordellii lethal toxin modifies Ras, Rap, and Rac on T35 by glucosylation. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, deamidates Q63 of Rho into E63, thereby blocking the intrinsic or GAP-mediated GTPase of Rho. This allows permanent activation of Rho. Thus, Rho GTPases are targets for three different toxin activities. Molecular mechanisms of these toxins are discussed.
TI  - Involvement of Rho GTPases in calcium-regulated exocytosis from adrenal chromaffin cells.
AB  - The Rho GTPase family, including Rho, Rac and Cdc42 proteins, is implicated in various cell functions requiring the reorganization of actin-based structures. In secretory cells, cytoskeletal rearrangements are a prerequisite for exocytosis. We previously described that, in chromaffin cells, the trimeric granule-bound Go protein controls peripheral actin and prevents exocytosis in resting cells through the regulation of RhoA. To provide further insight into the function of Rho proteins in exocytosis, we focus here on their intracellular distribution in chromaffin cells. By confocal immunofluorescence analysis, we found that Rac1 and Cdc42 are exclusively localized in the subplasmalemmal region in both resting and nicotine-stimulated cells. In contrast, RhoA is associated with the membrane of secretory granules. We then investigated the effects of clostridial toxins, which differentially impair the function of Rho GTPases, on the subplasmalemmal actin network and catecholamine secretion. Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inactivates Rho, Rac and Cdc42, markedly altered the distribution of peripheral actin filaments. Neither Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin, which selectively ADP-ribosylates Rho, nor Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which inactivates Rac, affected cortical actin, suggesting that Cdc42 plays a specific role in the organization of subplasmalemmal actin. Indeed, toxin B strongly reduced secretagogue-evoked catecholamine release. This effect on secretion was not observed in cells having their actin cytoskeleton depolymerized by cytochalasin E or Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, suggesting that the inhibition of secretion by toxin B is entirely linked to the disorganization of actin. C. sordellii lethal toxin also inhibited catecholamine secretion, but this effect was not related to the actin cytoskeleton as seen in cells pretreated with cytochalasin E or C2 toxin. In contrast, C3 exoenzyme did not affect secretion. We propose that Cdc42 plays an active role in exocytosis by coupling the actin cytoskeleton to the sequential steps underlying membrane trafficking at the site of exocytosis.
TI  - Clostridium difficile colitis associated with infant botulism: near-fatal case analogous to Hirschsprung's enterocolitis.
AB  - We present the first five reported cases of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in children with infant botulism caused by Clostridium botulinum. We compare two fulminant cases of colitis in children with colonic stasis, the first caused by infant botulism and the second caused by Hirschsprung's disease. In both children, colitis was accompanied by hypovolemia, hypotension, profuse ascites, pulmonary effusion, restrictive pulmonary disease, and femoral-caval thrombosis. Laboratory findings included pronounced leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and, when examined in the child with infant botulism, detection of C. difficile toxin in ascites. CDAD recurred in both children, even though difficile cytotoxin was undetectable in stool after prolonged initial therapy. Four children who had both infant botulism and milder CDAD also are described. Colonic stasis, whether acquired, as in infant botulism, or congenital, as in Hirschsprung's disease, may contribute to the susceptibility to and the severity of CDAD.
TI  - TetR is a positive regulator of the tetanus toxin gene in Clostridium tetani and  is homologous to botR.
AB  - The TetR gene immediately upstream from the tetanus toxin (TeTx) gene was characterized. It encodes a 21,562-Da protein which is related (50 to 65% identity) to the equivalent genes (botR) in Clostridium botulinum. TetR has the feature of a DNA binding protein with a basic pI (9.53). It contains a helix-turn-helix motif and shows 29% identity with other putative regulatory genes in Clostridium, i.e., uviA from C. perfringens and txeR from C. difficile. We report for the first time the transformation of C. tetani by electroporation, which permitted us to investigate the function of tetR. Overexpression of tetR in C. tetani induced an increase in TeTx production and in the level of the corresponding mRNA. This indicates that TetR is a transcriptional activator of the TeTx gene. Overexpression of botR/A (60% identity with TetR at the amino acid level) in C. tetani induced an increase in TeTx production comparable to that for overexpression of tetR. However, botR/C (50% identity with TetR at the amino acid level) was less efficient. This supports that TetR positively regulates the TeTx gene in C. tetani and that a conserved mechanism of regulation of the neurotoxin genes is involved in C. tetani and C. botulinum.
TI  - Inhibition of Rho is required for cAMP-induced melanoma cell differentiation.
AB  - Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway by forskolin or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone induces melanocyte and melanoma cell differentiation characterized by stimulation of melanin synthesis and dendrite development. Here we show that forskolin-induced dendricity is associated to a disassembly of actin stress fibers. Since Rho controls actin organization, we studied the role of this guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein in cAMP-induced dendrite formation. Clostridium botulinum C3 exotransferase, which inhibits Rho, mimicked the effect of forskolin in promoting dendricity and stress fiber disruption, while the Escherichia coli toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF-1), which activates Rho and the expression of a constitutively active Rho mutant, blocked forskolin-induced dendrite outgrowth. In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the Rho target p160 Rho-kinase (P160(ROCK)) prevented the dendritogenic effects of cAMP. Our results suggest that inhibition of Rho and of its target p160(ROCK) are required events for cAMP-induced dendrite outgrowth in B16 cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that Rho is involved in the regulation of melanogenesis. Indeed, Rho inactivation enhanced the cAMP stimulation of tyrosinase gene transcription and protein expression, while Rho constitutive activation impaired these cAMP-induced effects. This reveals that, in addition to controlling dendricity, Rho also participates in the regulation of melanin synthesis by cAMP.
TI  - Inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 cells by Clostridium difficile toxin B, Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin.
AB  - The role of the actin cytoskeleton and/or GTPases of the Rho/Rac-family in glucose transport regulation was investigated in 3T3-L1 cells with clostridial toxins which depolymerize actin by inactivation of Rho/Rac (Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostiridium sordellii lethal toxin (LT)) or by direct ADP-ribosylation (Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin). Toxin B and C2 reduced insulin-stimulated, but not basal, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake rates in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In parallel, the toxins produced morphological alterations of the cells reflecting disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Both toxins reduced the maximum response to insulin but failed to alter the half-maximally stimulating concentrations of insulin. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the lethal toxin reduced the effect of insulin on 2-DOG uptake, whereas toxin B and C2 failed to affect glucose transport or cell morphology. When cells were exposed to the toxins after treatment with insulin, both toxin B and the lethal toxin, in contrast to the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, failed to reduce the 2-DOG uptake rates. Thus, both translocation to the plasma membrane and internalization of glucose transporters were inhibited by the toxins, whereas the PI 3-kinase inhibitor selectively affects translocation. The data suggest that the effects of the clostridial toxins on trafficking of glucose transporters are mediated by the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and are an indirect consequence of Rho or Rac inactivation. It is suggested that pathways signalling through Rac or Rho may play a modulatory role in glucose transport regulation through their effects on the actin network.
TI  - Glucosylation and ADP ribosylation of rho proteins: effects on nucleotide binding, GTPase activity, and effector coupling.
AB  - We studied the effects of glucosylation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 at threonine-35  and -37 by Clostridium difficile toxin B on nucleotide binding, GTPase activity, and effector coupling and compared these results with the ADP ribosylation of RhoA at asparagine-41 catalyzed by Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase. Whereas glucosylation and ADP ribosylation had no major effects on GDP release from RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, the rate of GTPgammaS release from Rho proteins was increased 3-6-fold by glucosylation. ADP ribosylation decreased the rate of GTPgammaS release by about 50%. Glucosylation reduced the intrinsic activities of the GTPases by 3-7-fold and completely blocked GTPase stimulation by Rho-GAP. In contrast, ADP ribosylation slightly increased GTPase activity ( approximately 2-fold) and had no major effect on GAP stimulation of GTPase. Whereas ADP ribosylation did not affect the interaction of RhoA with the binding domain of protein kinase N, glucosylation inhibited this interaction. Glucosylation of Rac1 markedly diminished its ability to support the activation of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. Glucosylated Rac1 did not interfere with NADPH oxidase activation by unmodified Rac1, even when present in marked molar excess, indicating that it was incapable of competing for a common effector. The data indicate that the functional inactivation of small GTPases by glucosylation is mainly caused by inhibition of GTPase-effector protein interaction.
TI  - Specific inhibition of phorbol ester-stimulated phospholipase D by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and Clostridium difficile toxin B-1470 in HEK-293 cells. Restoration by Ral GTPases.
AB  - Activation of m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, leads to phospholipase D (PLD) stimulation, a process apparently involving Rho GTPases, as shown by studies with Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme and Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). Direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also induces PLD stimulation, which is additive to the mAChR action and which is only poorly sensitive to inactivation of Rho proteins by TcdB. To study whether Ras-like GTPases are involved in PLD regulation, we studied the effects of the TcdB variant TcdB-1470 and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL), known to inactivate Rac and some members of the Ras protein family, on PLD activities. TcdB-1470 and TcsL did not affect basal PLD activity and PLD stimulation by mAChR or direct G protein activation. In contrast, PMA-induced PLD stimulation was inhibited by TcdB-1470 and TcsL in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, without alteration in immunologically detectable PKC isozyme levels. In membranes of HEK-293 cells pretreated with TcdB-1470 or TcsL, basal and stable GTP analog-stimulated PLD activities measured with exogenous phosphatidylcholine, in the presence or absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, were not altered. In contrast, pretreatment with TcdB-1470 and TcsL, but not TcdB, strongly reduced PMA-stimulated PLD activity. The addition of recombinant Rac1, serving as glucosylation substrate for TcdB, TcsL, and TcdB-1470, did not restore PLD stimulation by PMA. Furthermore, PMA-stimulated PLD activity, suppressed by prior treatment with TcdB-1470 or TcsL, was not rescued by the addition of recombinant Ras (RasG12V) or Rap proteins, acting as glucosylation substrates for TcsL only (Ras) or TcdB-1470 and TcsL (Rap). In contrast, the addition of recombinant Ral proteins (RalA and RalB), glucosylation substrates for TscL and TcdB-1470, but not for TcdB, to membranes of TcdB-1470- or TcsL-treated cells fully restored PLD stimulation by PMA without altering the strict MgATP dependence of PMA-induced PLD stimulation. RalA-mediated restoration of PMA-stimulated PLD activity in membranes of TcsL-treated cells was not enhanced by coaddition of RasG12V. In conclusion, the data presented indicate that TcdB-1470 and TcsL selectively interfere with phorbol ester stimulation of PLD and suggest an essential role of Ral proteins in PKC signaling to PLD in HEK-293 cells.
TI  - [Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea treated with homologous feces].
AB  - The incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea has increased during  the last few years. Treatment with vankomycin or metronidazol is usually effective, but relapses are not uncommon. Some good results have been reported with faecal enemas, but it is a controversal form of treatment. 18 patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhoea were given homologous faeces from one healthy donor. In 17 patients faeces was instillated via a coloscope and in one patient via a gastrostoma. C. difficile toxin was detected in all patients. Three patients with severe colitis did not respond to the treatment. The remaining patients were clinically cured, and no relapses were observed. Treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea with faeces appears to be an alternative in moderate cases. In our limited number of patients we observed a poor correlation between the clinical picture, the endoscopic findings and the histological findings in colon biopsies. The ethical aspects of treatment with faeces will continue to be subject to discussion.
TI  - The natural beta-carbolines facilitate inositol phosphate accumulation by activating small G-proteins in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y).
AB  - The naturally occurring beta-carbolines exert psychotropic actions in humans and  have numerous behavioral effects in animals. The known in vitro activities of these substances do not provide a satisfactory explanation for their in vivo effects. The present study was undertaken to explore the possibility of a specific signal transduction pathway. The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was used as a model system. High-affinity binding sites for [3H]norharman (synonymous: beta-carboline) were detected. Pharmacological characterization revealed displacement of the ligand by beta-carbolines, to a weaker extent by indoleamines, but not by opioids, muscarinic receptor agonists, metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists or several peptide neurotransmitters. Inositol phosphate accumulation was only slightly affected by the beta-carbolines. However, the action of carbachol was clearly facilitated in a dose-dependent and pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Pretreatment of the cells with Clostridium difficile toxin B blocked the facilitating effect of the beta-carbolines by concentrations which did not affect the action of carbachol alone. This suggests that low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins are involved in the facilitating action of the beta-carbolines. This mechanism was further supported by experiments measuring the concentrations of phosphatidylinositol phosphates after various activating compounds. In conclusion, the facilitating effect of beta-carbolines on inositol phosphate accumulation could play a part in the actions of beta-carbolines and may be produced by stimulating the generation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2), the key component in the activation of phosphoinositide-phospholipase C.
TI  - Evidence for differential roles of the Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins in glucose- and calcium-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.
AB  - We utilized clostridial toxins (with known specificities for inhibition of GTPases) to ascertain the contribution of candidate GTPases in physiologic insulin secretion from beta cells. Exposure of normal rat islets or isolated beta (HIT-T15) cells to Clostridium difficile toxins A and B catalyzed the glucosylation (and thereby the inactivation) of Rac, Cdc42, and Rho endogenous to beta cells; concomitantly, either toxin reduced glucose- or potassium-induced insulin secretion from rat islets and HIT cells. Treatment of beta cells with Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (LT; which modified only Ras, Rap, and Rac) also reduced glucose- or potassium-induced secretion. However, clostridial toxin C3-exoenzyme (which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates only Rho) was without any effect on either glucose- or potassium-induced insulin secretion. These data suggest that Cdc42, Rac, Ras, and/or Rap (but not Rho) may be needed for glucose- or potassium-mediated secretion. The effects of these toxins appear to be specific on stimulus-secretion coupling, since no difference in metabolic viability (assessed colorimetrically by quantitating the conversion of the tetrazolium salt into a formazan in a reduction reaction driven by nutrient metabolism) was demonstrable between control and toxin (A or LT)-treated beta cells. Toxin (A or LT) treatment also did not alter glucose- or potassium-mediated rises in cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), suggesting that these GTPases are involved in steps distal to elevations in [Ca2+]i. Recent findings indicate that the carboxyl methylation of Cdc42 is stimulated by only glucose, whereas that of Rap (Kowluru et al., J Clin Invest 98: 540-555, 1996) and Rac (present study) are regulated by glucose or potassium. Together, these findings provide direct evidence, for the first time, that the Rho subfamily of GTPases plays a key regulatory role(s) in insulin secretion, and they suggest that Cdc42 may be required for early steps in glucose stimulation of insulin release, whereas Rap and/or Rac may be required for a later step(s) in the stimulus-secretion coupling cascade (i.e. Ca2+-induced exocytosis of insulin).
TI  - Bacterial toxins block endothelial wound repair. Evidence that Rho GTPases control cytoskeletal rearrangements in migrating endothelial cells.
AB  - We investigated the effect of bacterial toxins that modify and inactivate Rho GTP-binding proteins on the migratory response of endothelial cells to wounding. C3-transferase from Clostridium botulinum, EDIN from Staphylococcus aureus, and toxin A from Clostridium difficile blocked migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in an in vitro wound repair assay. Migrating HUVECs expressed actin microspikes (maximum at 10 minutes after wounding), ruffles (maximum at 12 hours), and fibers (maximum at 24 hours), and within these actin structures, vinculin-containing focal complexes/adhesions were formed. C3-Transferase ADP ribosylated RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC in HUVECs and abolished the formation of actin stress fibers/focal adhesions but had no effect on expression of microspikes, ruffles, or the associated vinculin-containing focal complexes. Similar results were obtained with EDIN and toxin A. These results indicate that endothelial cells migrating into a wounded area express distinct combinations of actin/vinculin structures in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. The GTPase Rho selectively controls the formation of actin fibers/focal adhesions that occurs 2 to 24 hours after wounding. A mechanism is proposed by which Rho-specific bacterial toxins could influence vascular repair, angiogenesis, or atherosclerosis.
TI  - Antibody responses to clostridial infection in humans.
AB  - Serum antibody responses to the major toxins produced by Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium tetani, and Clostridium botulinum have been documented following infection. Effective toxoid vaccines for tetanus and enteritis necroticans due to C. perfringens type C demonstrate the potential of antitoxin responses. Although individual serum and mucosal antibody responses to C. difficile enterotoxin (toxin A) vary, one-third of patients with C. difficile diarrhea develop neutralizing serum antibodies. IgA in the serum, not IgG, is typically responsible for this neutralization, suggesting a unique role for serum IgA in response to C. difficile infection, an infection that is usually limited to the intestinal mucosa. The relationship of naturally occurring antitoxin antibodies to the clinical course of C. difficile infection is controversial. However, patients with chronic relapsing C. difficile diarrhea and low levels of IgG to toxin A have shown clinical responses following intravenous therapy with immune globulin. Antibody responses to non-toxin C. difficile proteins also occur, but their significance is only partially known.
TI  - Involvement of Rho family proteins in prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced phospholipase D activation in the osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1.
AB  - To examine the role of Rho family proteins in prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-mediated phospholipase D (PLD) activation of osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1 cells, we used Toxin-B from Clostridium difficile, which inhibits Rho family proteins by monoglucosylation. Pretreatment of [3H]myristic acid-labeled MC3T3-E1 cells with Toxin B induced rounding-up of the cells and inhibited the PGF2 alpha-induced PLD activation by 60%, but not the phospholipase C (PLC) activation. Cytochalasin D also induced rounding the cells, but showed a small inhibition in the PLD activation. Brefeldin A (BFA) had marginal inhibitory effect on the PGF2 alpha-induced PLD activation. In digitonin-permeabilized MC3T3-E1 cells, [3H]P But formation was stimulated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) or 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the presence of Ca2+ (1 microM) and ATP (1 mM), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was also required for its full PLD activation. Pretreatment of the digitonin-permeabilized MC3T3-E1 cells with Toxin B reduced the GTP gamma S- and PMA-stimulated PLD activities by 80% and 60%, respectively. On the other hand, C3 toxin which inhibits Rho by ADP-ribosylation, exerted a partial inhibitory effect on the GTP gamma S-stimulated PLD activity. These results suggest that Cdc42 as well as RhoA appear to be involved in the PLD activation mediated by PGF2 alpha and also that the PLD activation may be independent of actin cytoskeleton in MC3T3-E1 cells.
TI  - Rho proteins play a critical role in cell migration during the early phase of mucosal restitution.
AB  - In the intestine, several growth factors stimulate migration of epithelial cells, contributing to the maintenance of tissue integrity. The Ras-like GTPase Rho regulates a signal transduction pathway linking growth factor receptors to the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, presumed to be important for motility. Using an in vitro wound-induced migration assay, we have examined the role of Rho GTPases in the migration of IEC-6 and Caco-2 cells, and provide evidence that the Rho GTPases play an essential role in the initial phase of mucosal wound healing. Treatment of the cells with Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, inhibitors of the Rho family GTPases inhibited migration in a dose-dependent fashion. Microinjection of the inhibitory exchange factor Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), or Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase (C3) toxin, a Rho-ADP-ribosylating exoenzyme, potently inhibited migration. Microinjection of RhoT19N, a dominant negative form of RhoA, or in vitro ADP-ribosylated RhoA impaired the ability of cells to migrate. Rho-GDI and C3 exoenzyme also inhibited EGF-induced migration of IEC-6 cells. These results demonstrate that Rho is required for endogenous and EGF-induced migration of small intestinal crypt cells, and that Rho proteins are essential elements of a mechanism by which growth factors induce cell migration to restitute mucosal integrity.
TI  - Transcription analysis of the genes tcdA-E of the pathogenicity locus of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - To analyse the transcription pattern of the five tcdA-E genes of the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) of Clostridium difficile a protocol was established to purify RNA from strain VPI10463. Transcription analysis of the five tcdA-E genes showed that they were all transcribed. In the early exponential phase, a high level of tcdC and low levels of tcdA,B,D,E transcripts were detectable; this was inverted in the stationary phase, suggesting that TcdC might have a negative influence on transcription of the other genes. Three transcription initiation sites, one for tcdA and two for tcdB were determined by primer extension analysis. Readthrough transcripts from outside the locus were not obtainable, so that parts of the transcription of tcdD, tcdB, tcdA and tcdC must occur by monocistronic transcription. Within the locus all possible intergenic readthrough transcripts were detectable except that between tcdC and tcdA, a stretch of DNA interrupted by a functional transcription terminator. Thus we found mono- and polycistronic transcription of tcdA and tcdB to occur which should lead to production of a surplus of tcdA over tcdB transcripts. This would explain the surplus of TcdA over TcdB expression observed in vitro. Due to its basic nature and similarity to BcnA of Clostridium perfringens and to Orf-22 of Clostridium botulinum, TcdD is most probably a regulatory protein with DNA-binding properties. On the basis of the presented study we discuss a model for the growth-phase-related, coordinate regulation of toxin expression wherein tcdC has a negative and tcdD a positive regulatory function on transcription of the tcdD,B,E and tcdA genes.

TI  - Increased activity of small GTP-binding protein-dependent phospholipase D during  differentiation in human promyelocytic leukemic HL60 cells.
AB  - In response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) and all-trans retinoic acid, human promyelocytic leukemic HL60 cells differentiate into granulocyte-like cells. In cell lysate and in vitro reconstitution system, phospholipase D (PLD) activity in response to guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) was up-regulated by dbcAMP or all-trans retinoic acid treatment. In the present study, the mechanism(s) for increased PLD activity during differentiation was examined. Western blot analysis revealed that the contents of ADP-ribosylation factor, Rac2, and Cdc42Hs but not RhoA and Rac1 in the cytosolic fraction were elevated during differentiation. However, the cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated cells was almost equally potent as the cytosolic fraction from differentiated cells in the ability to stimulate membrane PLD activity. It was shown that the GTPgammaS-dependent PLD activity in membranes from differentiated cells was much higher than that in membranes from undifferentiated cells, suggesting that the increased PLD activity during differentiation was due to alterations in some membrane component(s). Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 and C. difficile toxin B, which are known as inhibitors of RhoA and Rho family proteins, respectively, effectively suppressed PLD activity in membranes from differentiated cells. In fact, the amount of membrane-associated RhoA was increased during differentiation. Furthermore, the extent of GTPgammaS-dependent PLD activity partially purified from membranes from differentiated cells was greater than that from membranes from undifferentiated cells in the presence of recombinant ADP-ribosylation factor 1. The PLD (hPLD1) mRNA level was observed to be up-regulated during differentiation, as inferred by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Our results suggest the possibility that the increased Rho proteins in membranes and the changed level of PLD itself may be, at least in part, responsible for the increase in GTPgammaS-dependent PLD activity during granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells.
TI  - ADP-ribosylating and glucosylating toxins as tools to study secretion in RBL cells.
AB  - The influence of different ADP-ribosylating and glucosylating cytotoxins on stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells was studied. Treatment of RBL cells with Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, which specifically ADP-ribosylated monomeric G-actin and caused complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells, inhibited Fc epsilon RI receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with maximal effects at 100 ng/ml C2I and 200 ng/ml C2I. C2 toxin (10 ng/ml C2I and 20 ng/ml C2II) increased antigen- or calcium ionophore (A23187)-stimulated [3H]serotonin release maximally by about 3 fold. Clostridium botulinum C3, which ADP-ribosylated Rho in intact RBL cells, had no effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulated secretion. In contrast, the cytotoxic Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB), which glucosylated the Rho-subtype family members RhoA and Cdc42, blocked or reduced antigen- or calcium ionophore-mediated [3H]serotonin release, respectively, and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110 kDa protein. The data indicate that different actin pools control tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion in RBL cells and suggest that Rho subfamily proteins regulate secretion independently of the actin cytoskeleton.
TI  - Regulation of phospholipase C and D activities by small molecular weight G proteins and muscarinic receptors.
AB  - The role of small molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) of the Rho family in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) signaling to phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) was studied in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, stably expressing the human m3 receptor subtype. Evidence for the involvement of Rho proteins in m3 mAChR signaling to both phospholipases is based on findings obtained with Clostridium (C.) difficile toxin B and C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme, both of which specifically, although by different mechanisms, inactivate Rho family G proteins. Toxin B potently inhibited both the mAChR-stimulated PLC and PLD activities in intact cells as well as the stimulation of both phospholipases by the stable GTP analog GTPgammaS in permeabilized cells, the latter effect being mimicked by C3 exoenzyme. In contrast, PLC and PLD activities, measured in the presence of exogenous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2], a substrate and cofactor for PLC and PLD, respectively, were not altered. These data suggested that the Rho-inactivating toxins inhibit stimulation of PLC and PLD by reducing the cellular level of PtdIns(4,5)P2, which was indeed found with both toxin B and C3 exoenzyme. In agreement with a crucial role of cellular PtdIns(4,5)P2 supply for PLC signaling, we observed that short-term agonist (carbachol) treatment of HEK cells caused a long-lasting increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2 level, accompanied by a potentiation of receptor- and G protein-stimulated inositol phosphate formation. Finally, studies with tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors strongly suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis and mAChR-stimulated PLD activity in HEK cells apparently also involve a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism(s). Thus, m3 mAChR signaling to PLC and PLD in HEK cells requires the concerted action of various intracellular components, most notably the complex regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis.
TI  - Role of Rho proteins in carbachol-induced contractions in intact and permeabilized guinea-pig intestinal smooth muscle.
AB  - 1. The aim of this study was to determine whether the low molecular mass GTPase RhoA or related proteins are involved in carbachol- and high-K(+)-induced contractions in intact intestinal smooth muscle as well as the carbachol-induced increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments in permeabilized preparations. 2. The carbachol-induced increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force production in beta-escin-permeabilized intestinal smooth muscle was enhanced in preparations that were loaded with the constitutively active mutant of RhoA, Val14RhoA, and was inhibited by exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates small GTPases of the Rho family. The effect of C3 on Ca2+ sensitivity in the absence of the agonist was negligible, while the maximal Ca(2+)-activated force was inhibited by about 20%. 3. Inhibition of carbachol-induced force was associated with an increase in ADP-ribosylation of a protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 22 kDa, corresponding to Rho, and was partially reversed in the presence of Ile41RhoA, which is not a substrate for C3. Val14RhoA did not restore carbachol-induced Ca2+ sensitization in C3-treated smooth muscle. 4. In intact intestinal smooth muscle, toxin B from Clostridium difficile, which monoglucosylates members of the Rho family, inhibited high-K(+)-induced contractions and the initial phasic response to carbachol by about 30%. The delayed contractile response to carbachol was completely inhibited. 5. In smooth muscle preparations that were permeabilized with beta-escin after treatment with toxin B, carbachol-and GTP gamma S-induced Ca2+ sensitization was significantly inhibited. 6. These findings are consistent with a role for Rho or Rho-like proteins in agonist-induced increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of force production in intact and permeabilized intestinal smooth muscle.
TI  - Inhibition by toxin B of inositol phosphate formation induced by G protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase receptors in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells: involvement of Rho proteins.
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors activate phospholipase C (PLC)-beta isoforms by the alpha or beta gamma subunits of G proteins, whereas growth-factor receptors activate PLC-gamma isoforms by phosphorylating tyrosine residues of the enzyme. As a common substrate for PLC enzymes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [Ptdins(4,5)P2] may play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular PLC activity. Because small-molecular-weight G proteins have been implicated in the synthesis of Ptdins(4,5)P2, we studied the effect of Clostridium difficile toxin B, which glucosylates and thereby inactivates small G proteins of the Rho family, on receptor-stimulated PLC activity. We report here that in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, stimulation of inositol phosphate formation by the G protein-coupled receptor agonists bradykinin and lysophosphatidic acid and by the tyrosine kinase receptor agonist platelet-derived growth factor is largely attenuated by toxin B treatment. Furthermore, inositol phosphate production stimulated by the stable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)-triphosphate in permeabilized N1E-115 cells was inhibited by C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates Rho proteins. The inhibition by toxin B was apparently not caused by its effect on the cytoskeleton. In addition, the level of platelet-derived growth factor receptors, which was studied with immunoblotting, was unaffected by toxin B. Using exogenous Ptdlns(4,5)P2 as PLC substrate, it was found that the intrinsic enzymatic activity of PLC activated either by Ca2+ or by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate was not altered by toxin B. However, toxin B decreased strongly, by up to 80%, the cellular level of Ptdins(4,5)P2 in a concentration-dependent manner, without changing those of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. These results, together with the recent finding that Rho family proteins can regulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase activity, demonstrate that Rho proteins are presumably important regulators of Ptdins(4,5)P2 synthesis and, thereby, play an integral role in the regulation of cellular signaling by PLC enzymes.
TI  - A role for Rho in receptor- and G protein-stimulated phospholipase C. Reduction in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by Clostridium difficile toxin B.
AB  - Receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) activate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes by activated alpha of free beta gamma subunits of the relevant G proteins. To study whether low molecular weight G proteins of the Rho family are involved in receptor signaling to PLC, we examined the effect of Clostridium difficile toxin B, which glucosylates and thereby inactivates Rho proteins, on the regulation of PLC activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably expressing the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtype. Toxin B treatment of HEK cells did not affect basal PLC activity, but potently and efficiently inhibited mAChR-stimulated inositol phosphate formation. PLC activation by the endogenously expressed thrombin receptor and by the direct G protein activators, A1F-4 and guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP gamma S), studied in intact and permeabilized cells, respectively, were also inhibited by toxin B treatment. C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates Rho proteins, mimicked the inhibitory effect of toxin B on GTP gamma S-stimulated PLC activity. Finally both toxin B and C3 exoenzyme significantly reduced, by 40 to 50%, the total level of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in HEK cells, without affecting the levels of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Accordingly, When PLC activity was measured with exogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 as enzyme substrate, Ca(2+)- as well as GTP gamma S- or A1F-4-stimulated PLC activities were not altered by prior toxin B treatment. In conclusion, evidence is provided that toxin B and C3 exoenzyme, apparently by inactivating Rho proteins, inhibit G protein-coupled receptor signalling to PLC, most likely by reducing the cellular substrate supply.
TI  - Genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of Clostridium botulinum  strain NCTC 2916.
AB  - An 8 kb segment of the Clostridium botulinum NCTC 2916 genome 5' to the type A botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames. Four encode components (HA70, HA17, HA34 and NTNH/A) of the progenitor toxin complex. The product of the fifth, OrfX, possesses a putative C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including MsmR from Streptococcus mutans, UviA from C. perfringens and Orftxe1 located upstream of the C. difficile toxin B gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types B, C, D and G botulinum toxins. Primer extension and Northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [HA34, HA17, HA70] and [NTNH/A, type A toxin gene], with the OrfX gene expressed singly. Immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the HA34 and NTNH/A genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-ATTTTagGTTTACAAAA-3' and 5'-ATGTTATATgTaA-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. Homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type C botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. It is likely that these sequence motifs, together with OrfX, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups I, III and IV C. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.
TI  - Inhibition of Fc epsilon-RI-mediated activation of rat basophilic leukemia cells  by Clostridium difficile toxin B (monoglucosyltransferase)
AB  - Treatment of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) 2H3-hm1 cells with Clostridium difficile toxin B (2 ng/ml), which reportedly depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton, blocked [3H]serotonin release induced by 2,4-dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin, carbachol, mastoparan, and reduced ionophore A23187-stimulated degranulation by about 55-60%. In lysates of RBL cells, toxin B 14C-glucosylated two major and one minor protein. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, RhoA and Cdc42 were identified as protein substrates of toxin B. In contrast to toxin B, Clostridium botulinum transferase C3 that selectively inactivates RhoA by ADP-ribosylation did not inhibit degranulation up to a concentration of 150 microg/ml. Antigen-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein was inhibited by toxin B as well as by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Depolymerization of the microfilament cytoskeleton of RBL cells by C. botulinum C2 toxin or cytochalasin D resulted in an increased [3H]serotonin release induced by antigen, carbachol, mastoparan, or by calcium ionophore A23187, but without affecting toxin B-induced inhibition of degranulation. The data indicate that toxin B inhibits activation of RBL cells by glucosylation of low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins of the Rho subfamily (most likely Cdc42) by a mechanism not involving the actin cytoskeleton.
TI  - Inhibition of receptor signaling to phospholipase D by Clostridium difficile toxin B. Role of Rho proteins.
AB  - Rho proteins have been reported to activate phospholipase D (PLD) in in vitro preparations. To examine the role of Rho proteins in receptor signaling to PLD, we studied the effect of Clostridium difficile toxin B, which glucosylates Rho proteins, on the regulation of PLD activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably expressing the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). Toxin B treatment of HEK cells potently and efficiently blocked mAChR-stimulated PLD. In contrast, basal and phorbol ester-stimulated PLD activities were not or only slightly reduced. Cytochalasin B and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, mimicking the effect of toxin B on the actin cytoskeleton but without involving Rho proteins, had no effect on mAChR-stimulated PLD. Toxin B did not alter cell surface mAChR number and mAChR-stimulated binding of (guanosine 5'-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) to G proteins. In addition to mAChR-stimulated PLD, toxin B treatment also inhibited PLD activation by the direct G protein activators, AlF4- and GTP gamma S, studied in intact and permeabilized cells, respectively. Finally, C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates Rho proteins, mimicked the inhibitory effect of toxin B on GTP gamma S-stimulated PLD activity. In conclusion, the data presented indicate that toxin B potently and selectively interferes with receptor coupling mechanisms to PLD, and furthermore suggest an essential role for Rho proteins in receptor signaling to PLD.
TI  - Monoglucosylation of low-molecular-mass GTP-binding Rho proteins by clostridial cytotoxins.
AB  - Rho proteins, which are involved in receptor-mediated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, are substrates for ADP-ribosylation by Clostridium botulinum C3 toxins. Recently, it was shown that Rho and other members of the Rho subfamily of low-molecular-mass GTP-binding proteins are glucosylated by C. difficile toxins A and B. Glucosylation occurs at threonine-37, which is a crucial amino acid residue for the regulatory functions of the small GTP-binding proteins. These toxins should prove useful as tools for studying the functions of Rho proteins.
TI  - Transient expression of RhoA, -B, and -C GTPases in HeLa cells potentiates resistance to Clostridium difficile toxins A and B but not to Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin.
AB  - The bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficle synthesizes two high-molecular-weight toxins (A and B), which exhibit toxic effects in vivo and in vitro. Here, we present evidence that the major intracellular targets of these two toxins are the Rho GTPases. Overexpression of RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC GTPases in transfected HeLa cells conferred an increased resistance to toxins A and B, indicating that these toxins cause their cytopathic effects primarily by affecting Rho proteins. In addition, toxin A and B treatment appeared to result in modification of Rho, since Rho isolated from toxin-treated cells had a decreased ability to be ADP-ribosylated by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme. In contrast, the lethal toxin (LT) of Clostridium sordellii, although structurally and immunologically related to C. difficile toxin B, appeared to induce cytopathic effects independently of the Rho GTPases. Overexpression of RhoA in transfected HeLa cells did not protect them from the effect of LT, and Rho isolated from lysates of LT-treated cells was not resistant to modification by C3. Immunofluorescence studies showed that LT treatment caused a cytopathic effect that was very different from those described for C. difficile toxins A and B, resulting in an increase in cortical F-actin, with a concomitant decrease in the number of stress fibers, and in the formation of numerous microvilli containing the actin-bundling protein fimbrin/plastin.
TI  - Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1: evidence for induction of actin  assembly by constitutive activation of the p21 Rho GTPase.
AB  - Cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (CNF1) induces in HEp-2 cells an increase in  F-actin structures, which was detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis 24 h after addition of this factor to the culture medium. Increase in F-actin was correlated with the augmentation of both the cell volume and the total cell actin content. Actin assembly-disassembly is controlled by small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, which have been reported recently to be modified by CNF1 treatment. Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3, both known to act on the Rho GTPase, were used as biological tools to study the effect of CNF1 on this protein. CNF1 incubated before, during, or after exposure to the chimeric toxin C3B (which is the product of a genetic fusion between the DNA coding for C3 and the one coding for the B fragment of diphtheria toxin) protected HEp-2 cells from the disruption of F-actin structures caused by inactivation of the Rho GTPase through its ADP-ribosylation. On the other hand, C. difficile toxin B cytopathic effect was not observed upon preincubation of cells with CNF1. Toxins acting through a Rho-independent mechanism, such as cytochalasin D and Clostridium spiroforme iota-like toxin, could not be modified in their cellular activities by CNF1 treatment. All of our results suggest that CNF1 modifies the Rho molecule, thus probably protecting this GTPase from further bacterial toxin modification.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin-resistant cell line: evidence for possible involvement of the cellular C2II receptor in growth regulation.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, which consists of the binding component C2II and  the enzyme component C2I, acts on eukaryotic cells by selective ADP-ribosylation of G-actin. To obtain C2 toxin-resistant cells, we mutagenized CHO-K1 cells with N-nitroso-N-methylurea and selected for C2 resistance. Cells which survived the selection procedure with 50 ng of C2I and 100 ng of C2II per ml were obtained with a frequency of 30 x 10(-6). The colony-forming ability of CHO wild-type cells was reduced to 50% with 10 ng of C2I and 20 ng of C2II per ml. In contrast, the colony-forming ability of the isolated CHO mutant cells was not influenced by up to 200 ng of C2I and 400 ng of C2II per ml. Toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of G-actin was not impaired in lysates of mutant cells. The C2 toxin-resistant phenotype remained sensitive to the cell-rounding activities of cytotoxins from C. perfringens (iota-toxin), C. novyi, C. difficile, and C. botulinum (C3) and to cytochalasin D. Binding of component C2II was impaired in resistant CHO cells, suggesting mutation of the toxin cell surface receptor. Serum factors protected wild-type cells against the cytotoxic effect of C2 toxin. Furthermore, the C2-resistant phenotype correlated with an increased serum dependency. The data suggest that the action of C. botulinum C2 toxin is mediated by its binding and uptake via a cell surface receptor which might be involved in growth regulation.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - The low molecular mass GTP-binding protein Rho is affected by toxin A from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Enterotoxin A is one of the major virulence factors of Clostridium difficile, and the causative agent of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. In cell culture (NIH-3T3, rat basophilic leukemia cells) toxin A inhibits Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 (C3)-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Rho participates in the regulation of the microfilament cytoskeleton. Decrease in ADP-ribosylation of Rho occurs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and precedes the toxin A-induced destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. Action of toxin A is not due to proteolytical degradation of Rho or to an inherent ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of toxin A. Toxin A-induced decrease in ADP-ribosylation is observed also in cell lysates and with recombinant RhoA protein. A heat stable low molecular mass cytosolic factor is essential for the toxin effect on Rho. Thus, the enterotoxin (toxin A) resembles the effects of the C. difficile cytotoxin (toxin B) on Rho proteins (Just, I., G. Fritz, K. Aktories, M. Giry, M. R. Popoff, P. Boquet, S. Hegenbath, and C. Von Eichel-Streiber. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269:10706-10712). The data indicate that despite different in vivo effects, toxin A and toxin B act on the same cellular target protein Rho to elicit their toxic effects.
TI  - Clostridial infection in children.
AB  - A survey of the isolation of Clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. The isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified Clostridium spp., 37 (33%) C. perfringens, 13 (12%) C. ramosum, five (4%) C. innocuum, six (5%) C. botulinum, three (3%) C. difficile, two (2%) C. butyricum, and one isolate each of C. bifermentans, C. clostridiiforme, C. limosum and C. paraputrificum. Most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). Predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. These were immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). The clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. The species most commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (50), Escherichia coli (22), pigmented Prevotella or Porphyromonas spp. (18) and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Most Bacteroides and Escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck sites. Antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). Only two patients died. These data illustrate the importance of Clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.
TI  - Probing the action of Clostridium difficile toxin B in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
AB  - Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme caused comparable morphological alteration of CHO cells, which was accompanied by disaggregation of the microfilamental cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect of toxin B was correlated with a decrease in C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the low-molecular-mass GTP-binding protein Rho, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We used Xenopus laevis oocytes as a model to study the toxin effect on Rho in more detail. Toxin B treatment of oocytes caused a decrease in subsequent ADP-ribosylation of cytoplasmic Rho by C3. This decrease was observed when toxin B was applied externally or after microinjection. Besides endogenous Rho, microinjected recombinant Rho-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was affected. Impaired ADP-ribosylation of Rho was neither due to altered guanine nucleotide binding nor to complexation with the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, which is known to inactivate Rho and to prevent Rho modification by C3. Proteolytical degradation of Rho was excluded by immunoblot analysis. In intact oocytes toxin B caused neither ADP-ribosylation nor phosphorylation of Rho. The data indicate that C. difficile toxin B acts on Rho proteins in Xenopus oocytes to inhibit ADP-ribosylation by C3. It is suggested that toxin B mediates its cytotoxic effect via functional inactivation of Rho.
TI  - Reactivity of the CD D-1 latex test with Clostridium difficile and other bacteria.
AB  - The reactivity of a commercial latex test with thirty-three species of bacteria was tested. Toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile gave a positive result in the CD D-1 latex test. Cross-reactions were also given by C. putrificum, C. sporogenes and proteolytic C. botulinum.
TI  - Clostridium difficile toxin B acts on the GTP-binding protein Rho.
AB  - Clostridium difficile toxin B exhibits cytotoxic activity that is characterized by the disruption of the microfilamental cytoskeleton. Here we studied whether the GTP-binding Rho protein, which reportedly participates in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, is involved in the toxin action. Toxin B treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells reveals a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme in the cell lysate. Disruption of the microfilament system induced by C. botulinum C2 toxin or cytochalasin D does not cause impaired ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Toxin B exhibits its effects on Rho not only in intact cells but also when added to cell lysates. Besides endogenous Rho, RhoA-glutathione S-transferase (Rho-GST) fusion protein added to cell lysate showed decreased ADP-ribosylation after toxin B treatment. Immunoblot analysis reveals identical amounts of Rho-GST and no change in molecular mass after toxin B treatment compared with controls. ADP-ribosylation of Rho-GST purified from toxin B-treated cell lysate is inhibited, indicating a modification of Rho itself. Finally, transfection of rhoA DNA under the control of a strong promoter into cells protects them from the activity of toxin B. Altogether, the data indicate that C. difficile toxin B acts directly or indirectly on Rho proteins to inhibit ADP-ribosylation and suggest that the cytotoxic effect of toxin B involves Rho.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Morphological changes of cultured endothelial cells after microinjection of toxins that act on the cytoskeleton.
AB  - Clostridium novyi alpha-toxin and C. difficile toxins A and B (all 200 to 300 kDa) and C. botulinum C2-I toxin (50 kDa) caused a delayed and persistent retraction and rounding of microinjected cells. Microinjected phalloidin acted fast and reversibly. Unlike C2-I toxin, phalloidin passed through the intercellular junctions. Specific antitoxin applied to the medium did not prevent the action of microinjected C. novyi or C. difficile toxin B. Microinjected antitoxin protected against the toxins applied with the medium or injected into the same cells.
TI  - Classification of medically important clostridia using restriction endonuclease site differences of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA.
AB  - Restriction maps were constructed of enzymically amplified 16S rRNA genes (rDNA)  isolated from eight Clostridium species. Using maximum parsimony, a dendrogram was constructed from these and published 16S rRNA sequence data. Two distinct clusters were identified: cluster I contained C. difficile, C. sordelli, and C. bifermentans, and showed 30 of 35 restriction sites in common; cluster II contained C. tetani, C. perfringens C. sporogenes and C. botulinum C and G, and showed 20 of 35 restriction sites in common. Further analysis of cluster I organisms revealed that of five HpaII fragments, two were found in equal amounts in all organisms, one was found in varying amounts in all organisms, and two were found, in varying amounts, only in C. sordelli and C. bifermentans. C. sordelli-specific and C. bifermentans-specific HpaII fragments were demonstrated by Southern hybridization of rDNA. One HpaII site within the rDNA was present on most alleles in C. bifermentans, present on a minority of alleles in C. sordelli and absent in C. difficile. This suggested that there were two 16S rRNA alleles with different sequences present within each of the genomes of C. bifermentans and C. sordelli.
TI  - Cellular and molecular actions of binary toxins possessing ADP-ribosyltransferase activity.
AB  - Clostridial organisms produce a number of binary toxins. Thus far, three complete toxins (botulinum, perfringens and spiroforme) and one incomplete toxin (difficile) have been identified. In the case of complete toxins, there is a heavy chain component (Mr approximately 100,000) that binds to target cells and helps create a docking site for the light chain component (Mr approximately 50,000). The latter is an enzyme that possesses mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase activity. The toxins appear to proceed through a three step sequence to exert their effects, including a binding step, an internalization step and an intracellular poisoning step. The substrate for the toxins is G-actin. By virtue of ADP-ribosylating monomeric actin, the toxins prevent polymerization as well as promoting depolymerization. The most characteristic cellular effect of the toxins is alteration of the cytoskeleton, which leads directly to changes in cellular morphology and indirectly to changes in cell function (e.g. release of chemical mediators). Binary toxins capable of modifying actin are likely to be useful tools in the study of cell biology.
TI  - Purification of the Clostridium spiroforme binary toxin and activity of the toxin on HEp-2 cells.
AB  - The two components Sa (Mr, 44,000) and Sb (Mr, 92,000) of Clostridium spiroforme  toxin were identified and characterized. Serological data permitted the identification of two groups of actin ADP-ribosylating clostridial toxins. The first consists of only C. botulinum C2. The second group includes spiroforme toxin, iota toxin of C. perfringens E, and an enzyme called CDT found in one strain of C. difficile, antibodies against which cross-react with all of the members of both groups. C. spiroforme toxin acted on cells by disrupting microfilaments by ADP-ribosylation of G actin. Toxicity was not blocked by 10 or 20 mM ammonium chloride and was only moderately inhibited by 30 mM NH4Cl. Inhibition of coated-pit formation in HEp-2 cells by potassium depletion strongly protected against the effect of C. spiroforme toxin. Toxicity was not blocked by incubation of HEp-2 cells and spiroforme toxin at 15 degrees C. These results suggest that this new binary toxin enters cells via the coated-pit-coated-vesicle pathway and might reach the cytoplasm at the same time as or before transfer to early endosomes.
TI  - Evaluation of a commercial latex test for Clostridium difficile for reactivity with C. difficile and cross-reactions with other bacteria.
AB  - Seventy-eight species of bacteria (739 isolates) were tested for reactivity with  a commercial latex test for Clostridium difficile. All noncytotoxic as well as cytotoxic strains of C. difficile reacted positively. Immuno-specific cross-reactions were found only with C. sporogenes, proteolytic C. botulinum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
TI  - Actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by a Clostridium difficile strain.
AB  - By screening possible ADP-ribosyltransferase activities in culture supernatants from various Clostridium species, we have found one Clostridium difficile strain (CD196) (isolated in our laboratory) that is able to produce, in addition to toxins A and B, a new ADP-ribosyltransferase that was shown to covalently modify cell actin as Clostridium botulinum C2 or Clostridium perfringens E iota toxins do. The molecular weight of the CD196 ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT) was determined to be 43 kilodaltons, and its isoelectric point was 7.8. No cytotoxic activity on Vero cells or lethal activity upon injection in mice was associated with this enzyme. CDT was neither related to C. difficile A or B toxins nor to C. botulinum C2 toxin component I. However, Vero cells cultivated in the presence of C. difficile B toxin had a lower amount of actin able to be ADP-ribosylated by CDT or C2 toxin in vitro. Antibodies raised against CDT reacted by immunoblot analysis with a 43-kilodalton protein of C. perfringens type E culture supernatant producing the iota toxin.
TI  - Clostridium spiroforme toxin is a binary toxin which ADP-ribosylates cellular actin.
AB  - We have purified from Clostridium spiroforme strain 246 an heterogeneous population of proteins (Sa) ranging from 43 to 47 kilodaltons exhibiting ADP-ribosyl transferase activity as do C. botulinum C2 toxin component I or the ia chain of C. perfringens E iota toxin. C. spiriforme Sa had alone no activity upon injection in mice or inoculated to Vero cells. When spiroforme ADP ribosyl transferase were mixed with a trypsin activated protein (Sb) separated from C. spiroforme bacterial supernatant, a lethal effect in mice and cytotoxicity on Vero cells were recorded. The Sa cross-reacted immunologically with either the light chain of C. perfringens E iota toxin or the ADP-ribosyl transferase from C. difficile 196 strain. No immunological relatedness was observed between Sa and C2 toxin component I. C. spiroforme toxin is thus another binary toxin close to iota.
TI  - [Morphological changes in human embryonic lung fibroblasts caused by cytotoxins of various Clostridium species].
AB  - A total of 243 strains of 35 Clostridium species were tested for cytotoxin production in cooked meat medium or liver broth within 48-72 h at 37 degrees C, using human embryonal lung fibroblasts in tissue-culture as indicator cells. Cytotoxin could be detected in the culture-filtrates of all toxigenic strains of C. chauvoei, C. difficile, C. histolyticum, C. novyi types A and B, C. septicum and C. tetani, but not in the atoxigenic ones. The cytotoxin of C. novyi correlated with alpha-toxin in the culture filtrate. All strains of C. perfringens and C. novyi D tested were not cytotoxic for lung fibroblasts despite their pathogenicity for guinea-pigs. Further cytotoxigenic strains were found among C. hastiforme, C. limosum, C. oceanicum, C. putrificum, C. ramosum, C. sordellii, C. sporogenes, and C. subterminale. The morphological changes in lung fibroblasts caused by the culture filtrates were characteristic and species-specific and corresponded with pathogenicity for guinea-pigs and/or mice. No cytotoxin was produced by C. absonum, C. barati, C. bifermentans, C. botulinum (atoxic), C. butyricum, C. cadaveris, C. carnis, C. clostridioforme, C. cochlearium, C. glycolicum, C. innocuum, C. malenominatum, C. mangenotii, C. paraputrificum, C. putrefaciens, C. rectum, C. tertium, and C. tyrobutyricum.
TI  - Partial characterization of the enzymatic activity associated with the binary toxin (type C2) produced by Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum produces a binary toxin that possesses a heavy chain (approximately 100,000 daltons) and a light chain (approximately 50,000 daltons). The heavy chain is a binding component that directs the toxin to vulnerable cells, and the light chain is an enzyme that has mono(ADP-ribosyl)ating activity. A number of experiments have been done to help characterize the enzymatic activity of the toxin. The data reveal that the enzyme has a pH optimum within the range of 7.0 to 8.0. It is not inhibited or stimulated by physiological concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium. The enzyme is inhibited by high concentrations of salt, however, as well as high concentrations of nicotinamide, thymidine, theophylline, and histamine; and it is stimulated by histone and lysolecithin. Boiling irreversibly denatures the light chain of the toxin, but denaturation caused by guanidine and urea is substantially reversible. Enzymatic activity is not altered by short exposure to lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin B, cathepsin H, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, and catheptic carboxypeptidase B.
TI  - [Microbiological research methods of drinking water regulation in West Germany from 1986. Suitability of the specifications of DIN 38411, Part 7, for the detection of sulfite-reducing, spore-forming anaerobes (Clostridia)].
AB  - The drinking-water regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany, from 22.05.1986, contains in paragraph 1 the instructions: "Drinking-water must be free of pathogens", and further in paragraph 11, "Responsibilities of the employer or other owner of a water supplying facility", include that: "The official authority may direct, that the employer...of a water supplying facility has to extend or has to cause to extend the microbiological examinations in order to determine, that...sulfite-reducing, spore-forming anaerobes (Clostridia) can not be detected in 20 ml of water..." The drinking-water regulations do not prescribe a bacteriological examination method in detail. Appendix 1 rules only that the examination for sulfite-reducing, spore-forming anaerobes (Clostridia) has to be performed after heating the sample to 75 degrees C (+/- 5 degrees C) for 10 min, by either the multiple-tube or membrane filtration method and cultivation in DRCM1-medium. If growth occurs, the presence of Clostridia must be confirmed by anaerobic and aerobic subcultivation. Furthermore, a DIN-instruction (DIN 38411, part 7) exists, which prescribes a detailed procedure for multiple-tube and membrane filtration methods, but does not provide for strict anaerobiosis. We were, however, unable to detect Clostridia in a multitude of water samples with the methods of the DIN-regulation. In order to examine if neglect of strict anaerobiosis was the reason for these failures, we checked the suitability of the DIN-regulation for the isolation of Clostridia from drinking water. In preliminary tests we examined up to four strains of the species C. botulinum, C. cadaveris, C. cochlearium, C. difficile, C. innocuum, C. perfringens and C. tertium for their ability to form heat-resistent spores in four sporulation media. It was, however, not possible to find a medium, in which all strains could sporulate within one week. In order to characterize the detection of these anaerobes in water, one particularly well-sporulating strain of each of the following, C. cadaveris, C. difficile and C. perfringens, was selected and the multiple-tube and membrane-filtration methods were compared. Counts of C. difficile and C. perfringens detected by the multiple-tube method were identical with counts of test-suspensions determinded by the most probable number (MPN) method. It was found to be decisive that only freshly prepared DRCM-medium be used and that, disagreeing with the DIN-instruction, cultivation at 37 degrees C is continued for at least four days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Analysis of latex agglutination test for Clostridium difficile toxin A (D-1) and  differentiation between C difficile toxins A and B and latex reactive protein.
AB  - Virulent toxigenic and avirulent non-toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile gave a positive result in the latex agglutination test (LAT) for C difficile toxin A (D-1). Similar concentrations of latex agglutinating antigen were produced by these strains in vivo. Positive reactions were also given by C sporogenes, proteolytic C botulinum Types A, B, and A/F, and Bacteroides assaccharolyticus. The latex agglutinating antigen was denatured by boiling for 10 minutes, but not by heating at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes. The reaction was abolished by incubation of test material with crude C difficile antitoxin but not with other clostridial antitoxins or specific antitoxin to C difficile toxin A. The latex agglutinating antigen present in C difficile eluted between 0.39% and 0.47% M sodium chloride, and that produced by the other clostridia, between 0.35% and 0.43% M sodium chloride by fast protein liquid chromatography. The latex agglutinating antigen of C difficile was neither cytotoxic nor mouse lethal and was distinct from toxin A and toxin B. In the analysis of faecal specimens from patients with diarrhoea the latex agglutination test correlated better with the presence of C difficile than with toxin B and detected both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. The latex agglutination test should only be used in the laboratory as an alternative to culture for C difficile and not as a method for the detection of C difficile toxins.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. Clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - Demonstration of shared antigens in the genus Clostridium by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - Antigens prepared from several strains of each of 10 Clostridium species were used in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antisera raised against whole cells of a representative strain from each of the 10 species killed by ultra-violet irradiation. With the exception of C. cadaveris, the antisera gave similar results with antigens prepared from all strains of the homologous species. Antigens prepared from 13 other clostridial species were then investigated in an ELISA system with the 10 representative antisera. The results showed many cross-reactions, particularly in the C. perfringens group, the C. difficile/sordelli group and the C. botulinum/novyi/sporogenes group.
TI  - Breast feeding and toxigenic intestinal infections: missing links in crib death?
AB  - Infant botulism results when Clostridium botulinum spores germinate, colonize the gut, and there produce botulinal toxin, which after absorption causes flaccid muscle paralysis. The observed variation in the severity of the disease was linked to the infant's milk source, in that all sudden death cases indistinguishable from typical crib death occurred in infants who had been formula-fed, whereas the more gradual onset, hospitalized cases occurred in infants who were predominantly breast-fed. Secretory IgA antibody against C. botulinum vegetative cell antigens was found in human milk from mothers of both healthy infants and patients, a finding that further confirms the functioning of the "mucosal immune system" in humans. The hypothesis that some crib deaths might also result from other intestinally produced bacterial toxins was investigated by injecting infant rhesus monkeys with microgram amounts of purified Clostridium difficile toxins A and B; quiet death pathologically consistent with human crib death occurred within 4 hr to 10 hr. This and other evidence suggest that infant botulism may be the prototype of a putative class of heretofore unrecognized diseases, the "toxigenic intestinal infections of infancy." Collectively, these illnesses may account for a modest proportion of crib death, against which human milk may provide relative protection.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
TI  - Rapid death of infant rhesus monkeys injected with Clostridium difficile toxins A and B: physiologic and pathologic basis.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum can colonize and produce botulinal toxin in the human infant intestine, which the toxin then permeates to cause generalized flaccid paralysis, and occasionally, sudden death. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that toxins produced by other intestinal clostridia, e.g., C. difficile, might also cause systemic illness and sometimes death in infants (J Pediatr 100:568, 1982). Because this hypothesis could not be evaluated clinically until the systemic manifestations of C. difficile toxins in primates were known, infant rhesus monkeys were given 6 to 11 micrograms/kg of the recently purified C. difficile toxins A or B, either intravenously or intraperitoneally. The animals showed no abnormalities for several hours, but then developed lethargy, hypotonia, hypothermia, and, shortly before death, sudden elevation of serum concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus and of enzymes that derived mainly from skeletal muscle, heart and brain. Five of six animals died quietly 3.5 to 8.0 hours after onset of symptoms. Death appeared to result from cessation of breathing, after which the sinus tachycardia then deteriorated to a flat ECG. Necropsy findings were insufficient to explain the cause of death. It appears that in infant monkeys microgram amounts of C. difficile toxins A and B can produce a rapid quiet death, the cause of which is undetectable at necropsy, a situation pathologically reminiscent of crib death in human infants, although the possible clinical identity of these two conditions has yet to be established.
TI  - Differentiation of Clostridium difficile toxin from Clostridium botulinum toxin by the mouse lethality test.
AB  - The mouse lethality test is the most sensitive method for confirming the diagnosis of infant botulism. Both Clostridium difficile and Clostridium botulinum produce heat-labile toxins which are lethal for mice and can be found in the feces of infants. These two toxins can be distinguished from one another in this assay when both are present in the same fecal specimen because they appear to be immunologically distinct toxins.
TI  - Leucine dissimilation to isovaleric and isocaproic acids by cell suspensions of amino acid fermenting anaerobes: the Stickland reaction revisited.
AB  - Freshly compared cell suspensions of clostridia (Clostridium bifermentans, C. botulinum proteolytic type A, C. difficile, C. sordellii, and C. sporogenes) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted leucine to isovaleric (iV) and isocaproic (iC) acids in the absence of other amino acids. The optimal pH for conversion was between 8 and 9 at 37 degrees C. The stoichiometry of reaction was compatible with that expected for the Stickland reaction, as the ratio of iV to iC was 1:2, the amount of CO2 produced was equivalent to that of iV, and ammonium ion concentrations were equal to the total C5 and C6 acids formed. The presence of alanine and valine (proton donors in the Stickland reaction) in incubations effectively increased the concentration of iC at the expense of iV production, implying that leucine acted there primarily as a proton acceptor. Glycine and proline (proton acceptors) stimulated both iV and iC production from leucine, but increases in iV concentrations were proportionately greater than for iC so that leucine was primarily a proton donor in the presence of proton acceptors. Glucose stimulated the conversion of leucine to volatile fatty acids but favoured iC production. Production of iC from leucine was inhibited by surface active compounds (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and desoxycholate) as well as arsenite and iodoacetate. The redox dyes methyl viologen and phenosafranine inhibited iC production more severely than iV production, as did the nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, metronidazole.
TI  - Toxin-producing bacteria in infants. Lack of an association with sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - After finding enterotoxigenic (ET) Escherichia coli in two consecutive cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), we initiated a prospective search for ET E coli in SIDS in Manitoba; in addition, we looked for toxigenic Clostridium botulinum and C difficile. In a 21-month period, small- and large-bowel contents were obtained in 33 cases of SIDS, from 32 control subjects, and in ten suspected cases of SIDS. Neither C botulinum nor ET E coli was isolated from any of these; C difficile was cultured from postmortem bowel contents of two SIDS and seven control cases. The overall isolation rate of C difficile was 17%. Despite the fact that two of these cases had toxin detectable in the bowel contents, no evidence of colitis was found in any of the cases with C difficile. We conclude that C botulinum or ET E coli have only a small role, if any, in the etiology of SIDS, and that C difficile is found relatively commonly in the gastrointestinal tract of infants without apparent local or systemic effects.
TI  - The end products of the metabolism of aromatic amino acids by Clostridia.
AB  - The end products of the metabolism of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan by growing cultures of clostridia have been identified. The species used were Clostridium aminovalericum; C. bifermentans; C. botulinum proteolytic type A; C. botulinum proteolytic type B; C. cochlearium; C. difficile; C. ghoni; C. histolyticum; C. lentoputrescens; C. limosum; C. lituseburense; C. malenomenatum; C. mangenoti; C. propionicum; C. putrefaciens; C. sordellii; C. sporogenes; C. sporosphaeroides; C. sticklandii; C. subterminale; C. tetani; C. tetanomorphum. The mixture of aromatic compounds formed, which depended upon the species, included phenyl acetic acid, phenyl propionic acid, phenyl lactic acid, phenol, p-cresol, p-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid, p-hydroxy phenyl propionic acid, indole, indole acetic acid and indole propionic acid.
TI  - The metabolism of pyrimidines by proteolytic clostridia.
AB  - Uracil was used by growing cultures of Clostridium sporogenes, and by proteolytic strains of C. botulinum types A and B. Uracil was not used by C. bifermentans; C. botulinum, type B (non-proteolytic); C. botulinum, type F (non-proteolytic); C. botulinum, type E; C. butyricum; C. cochlearium; C. difficile; C. histolyticum; C. oedematiens, type A; C. paraputrificum; C. scatologenes; C. specticum; C. sordellii; C. sticklandii; C. tertium; C. tetani; C. tetanomorphum; C. welchii, types A, B, C, E and 4 untyped strains. The growth of C. sporogenes was not increased by uracil; it was reduced to dihydrouracil. Experiments with washed cells of C. sporogenes showed that the uracil-reducing system was inducible. Washed cell suspensions incubated under hydrogen with uracil, thymine, iso-barbituric acid, 5-amino uracil and cytosine consumed 1 mole H2/mole pyrimidine. The reduction product of cytosine was dihydrouracil indicating that it was deaminated before reduction. The reduction products of the remaining pyrimidines were the corresponding dihydro derivatives. Extracts of C. sporogenes reduced uracil in the presence of NADPH2 but not NADH2.
