TI  - Lactobacilli isolated from chicken intestines: potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactobacillus strains were tested for their in vitro probiotic properties. Cell surface hydrophobicity was found to be very high for Lactobacillus fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and Salmonella Gallinarum; high values could indicate a greater ability to adhere to epithelial cells. Studies on Lactobacillus animalis indicated relative cell surface hydrophobicities smaller than those of L. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and L. fermentum. L. animalis and Enterococcus faecalis were able to coaggregate with L. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and L. fermentum, respectively, but not with Salmonella Gallinarum. After mixed-culture studies for determining suitable growth behavior, the pair of strains L. animalis plus L. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus was selected for an attempted challenge against Salmonella Gallinarum. Double and triple mixed-culture studies indicated that selected lactobacillus strains were able to retain their beneficial characteristics in the presence of Salmonella Gallinarum such as presence of lectins, production of antimicrobial compounds, and ability to grow and compete. The selected microorganisms can be considered as potential ingredients for a chicken probiotic feed formulation intended to control salmonellosis and also improve poultry sanitation.
