TI  == microbial diversity of traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) as determined by pcr-mediated dgge.
AB  == the diversity of fungi and bacteria associated with traditional vietnamese alcohol fermentation starters (banh men) was investigated by pcr-mediated dgge. from 52 starter samples, 13 species of fungi (including yeasts) and 23 species of bacteria were identified. the fungal composition of the starters was consistent with little variation among samples. it consisted of amylase producers (rhizopus  oryzae, r. microsporus, absidia corymbifera, amylomyces sp., saccharomycopsis fibuligera), ethanol producers (saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia sp., pichia anomala, candida tropicalis, p. ranongensis, clavispora lusitaniae), and (opportunistic) contaminants (xeromyces bisporus, botryobasidium subcoronatum). the bacterial microflora of starters was highly variable in species composition and dominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequent lab were pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, weissella confusa, and w. paramesenteroides. species of amylase-producing bacillus (bacillus subtilis, b. circulans, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. sporothermodurans), acetic acid  bacteria (acetobacter orientalis, a. pasteurianus), and plant pathogens/environment contaminants (burkholderia ubonensis, ralstonia solanacearum, pelomonas puraquae) were also detected. fungal dgge was found to be useful for evaluating starter type and starter quality. moreover, in view of the  high biological diversity of these substrates, bacterial dgge may be useful in determining the identity of a starter. the constant occurrence of opportunistic contaminants highlights the need for careful examination of the role of individual components in starters.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
