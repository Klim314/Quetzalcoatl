TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == molecular diversity of class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria found in wastewater environments in china.
AB  == the molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in jinan, china. out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance  were found. these isolates were classified into 19 rep-pcr types. these strains were identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing and found to be as follows: proteus mirabilis (16), escherichia coli (7), providencia spp. (7), proteus spp.  (2), p. vulgaris (3), shigella sp. (1), citrobacter freundii (1), and acinetobacter sp. (1). their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and  then either analyzed using pcr-rflp or sequenced. the typical array dfra1-sat2-aada1 was detected in 27 isolates. six atypical arrays were observed,  including three kinds of novel arrangements (linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1-orf441 or linf2(attc1)-dfra1(attc2)-aada1, dfra1-catb2-sat2-aada1, and estx(vr)-sat2-aada1) and a hybrid with the 3'cs of class 1 integrons (dfra1-sat2-aada1-qach), and dfra1-sat1. twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. results showed that water sources in the jinan  region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.

TI  == spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  == microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. however, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in china. we  conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (ni) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from january 2003 to december 2010. we studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. the number of nis per 100 admissions was 10.9. the commonest isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and candida (11.4%). the result indicated that the numbers of patients with acinetobacter sp. infection increased (p=0.004), but with proteus mirabilis infection decreased (p=0.004). the isolated acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost  all antibiotics tested. notably, more frequent acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the p. aeruginosa and e. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. the increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terminalia arjuna wight & arn.: an ethnomedicinal plant against pathogens causing ear infection.
AB  == ear infection is one of the common diseases occurring throughout the world. different etiological agents are responsible for ear infections. aim: to assess the antimicrobial potential of terminalia arjuna leaves and bark extracts against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, escherchia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, pathogens causing ear infections and their comparison with locally available ear drops. materials and methods: methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the leaves and bark of t. arjuna were tested for their antimicrobial activity. results: of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic leaf extract was found to be best against s. aureus. organic bark extract showed almost equal inhibition of all tested gram negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. however, aqueous extract of t. arjuna bark exhibited good activity against s. aureus. all the extracts were unable to exhibit any antifungal activity. conclusion: organic extract obtained from the t. arjuna bark and leaves may be used to treat the bacterial ear pathogens especially s. aureus, which has shown greater inhibition zones than the herbal drops, however, we still need more detailed studies as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties for their therapeutic utility in treating ear infections.

TI  == anti-bacterial studies on hemigraphis colorata (blume) h.g. hallier and elephantopus scaber l.
AB  == objective: to examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, hemigraphis colorata (h. colorata) leaves and stem and elephantopus scaber (e. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected  pathogens. methods: the fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. the dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 ml of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for  preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. results: the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum  ether extracts e. scaber leaves, flower and root and h. colorata leaves and stem  demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the  above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. the results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of h. colorata leaves and stem. the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts e. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). the root ethanolic extracts of e. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (24 mm), escherichia coli (e. coli) (16 mm) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) (13 mm). the chlorofrom extracts of e. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against bacillus cereus (b. cereus) (12 mm), the leaves ethanolic extracts of e.  scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz.,  enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) (18 mm), proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) (17 mm), salmonella typhi (s. typhi) (14 mm) and enterobacter sp. (11 mm) while the benzene extracts of h. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and s. aureus (12 mm). conclusions: it is  hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == [urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  == intruduction: one of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. the first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. the purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these  infections among patients treated in the department of rehabilitation after head  injury. material and methods: we gathered microbiological tests and observations  from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. results: in 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical  calculus in 11 cases. in one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the department. if the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. in 157 urinary infections we selected proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae and candida albicans was represented not so often. conclusions: the most frequent pathogens were: proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli. most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our department. these complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. it is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == [treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly].
AB  == sixty outpatients at the age of 65 to 75 years with exacerbated chronic bronchitis were treated with antibiotics: amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (20 patients), cefaclor (20 patients) and ciprofloxacin (20 patients). the treatment  course in all the cases was 5 days. bacteriological tests of the sputum specimens and estimation of the isolate antibiotic susceptibility by the disk diffusion method were applied to all the patients before and after the treatment. 73 per cent of the patients had mixed infection. the microflora mainly included various  species of streptococci highly susceptible to the drugs (54 per cent) as well as  highly susceptible strains of pneumococci and hemophilic bacilli (33 and 17 per cent respectively). atypical microflora was detected in 10 per cent of the cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were isolated in 2 cases. acinetobacter sp. slightly susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. citrobacter sp. slightly susceptible to cefaclor and moderately susceptible to ciprofloxacin  was detected in 1 case. enterobacter sp. moderately susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. a positive factor was moderate susceptibility of proteus mirabilis to all the three drugs. in 24 patients (the average age of 54.7 years) the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin administered under 2 different regimens was studied. the drug was used in a single dose of 400 mg once a day (group 1) or in a dose of 200 mg twice a day (group ii) followed by estimation of the drug concentration in the blood and sputum. the pathogen eradication was stated in 61.5 and 72.7 per cent of the patients in groups i and  ii, respectively. by the results of the treatment with the use of the above mentioned antibiotics in the elderly patients fluoroquinolones should be considered preferable from the clinical and pharmacoeconomic viewpoints.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury.
AB  == twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess  the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (acb) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive acb test on 45% of occasions. three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of acb; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for acb; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by proteus mirabilis (17.5%), klebsiella sp (12.5%), and proteus morganii (10%). providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive acb test (found in 17%). other bacteria associated with a positive acb test included klebsiella sp (14%), acinetobacter sp (12.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), citrobacter sp  (11.5%). a positive acb test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. it is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

AB  == antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four gram-positive and sixteen gram-negative bacteria. dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant serratia sp., proteus vulgaris, p. rettgeri and klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against gram-positive bacteria and  some gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogens, e. cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejunii. dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including aac(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == [treatment of urinary infection with cephadroxyl (pharmachem)--microbiological and clinical research].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the urine of renal patients were tested for sensitivity towards cephadroxyl (pharmachem) and other beta-lactam antibiotics--altogether 654 examinations were made. it was established that the gram-positive bacteria (excluding the enterococcus) are sensitive towards cephadroxyl. from the gram negative bacteria e. coli, klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp., p. mirabilis, citrobacter sp. showed the greatest sensitivity towards cephadroxyl, while the indole positive proteus were with low sensitivity  and p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., serratia were resistant towards cephadroxyl. 30 patients with persistent mainly secondary urinary infection were  treated with cephadroxyl. the clinical symptoms disappeared in 63.3% of the patients and another 26.7% of them showed considerable improvement. bacteriological sterility of the urine was achieved in 61.29% of the patients. the side effects were mild and rare, only in single cases.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == [sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the pitie-salpetriere hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a, a derivative of fortimicin a.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis,  indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the  exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid  bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == drug resistance in relation to use of silver sulphadiazine cream in a burns unit.
AB  == topical chemoprophylaxis of extensive burns with silver sulphadiazine cream led to a large increase in the proportion of sulphadiazine-resistant gram-negative bacilli in a burns unit. when all sulphonamide treatment in the ward was stopped; the incidence of sulphonamide-resistant strains fell back to levels similar to those recorded when silver sulphadiazine treatment was introduced. this was associated with a large reduction in the incidence of resistance of certain gram-negative bacilli (especially klebstella sp) to several antibiotics. transferable resistance to sulphadiazine, shown by conjugation experiments with escherichia coli k12, was found in a majority of the strains of klebsiella sp tested, and in other species. a pattern of transferable resistance to tetracycline, cephaloridine, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and sulphadiazine (t ce cl a ca s) was found in four of the 22 strains of klebsiella  tested, and closely related patterns were transferred by five other strains. these patterns of resistance were commonly found in klebsiella sp isolated from burns in the period before the withdrawal of sulphonamides from the ward but were found in none of the klebsiella strains isolated in the first six months after that period. strains of acinetobacter and proteus, in which transferable resistance was not found, showed no appreciable fall or rise in sulphadiazine resistance; there was no fall in resistance of these organisms to tetracycline, cephaloridine, chloramphenicol, ampicillin or carbenicillin on withdrawal of sulphonamides from the ward, but there were substantial falls in resistance of acinetobacter to kanamycin, gentamicin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline which were probably not caused by the withdrawal of sulphonamides.
