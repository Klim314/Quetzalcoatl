TI  == characterization of tryptophanase from vibrio cholerae.
AB  == tryptophanase (trpase) is a pyridoxal phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme responsible for the production of indole, an important intra- and interspecies signaling molecule in bacteria. in this study, the tnaa gene of vibrio cholerae coding for vctrpase was cloned into the pet-20b(+) vector and expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3) tn5:tnaa. using ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid (nta) chromatography, vctrpase was purified, and it possessed a molecular mass of approximately 49 kda with specific absorption peaks at 330 and 435 nm and a specific activity of 3 u/mg protein. the vctrpase had an 80 % homology to the trpase of haemophilus influenzae and e. coli, but only around 50 % identity to the trpase of proteus vulgaris and porphyromonas gingivalis. the optimum conditions for the enzyme were at ph 9.0 and 45 degrees c. recombinant vctrpase exhibited analogous kinetic reactivity to the ectrpase with k m and k cat values  of 0.612 x 10(-3) m and 5.252 s(-1), respectively. the enzyme catalyzed s-methyl-l-cysteine and s-benzyl-l-cysteine degradation, but not l-phenylalanine  and l-serine. using a site-directed mutagenesis technique, eight residues (thr52, tyr74, arg103, asp137, arg230, lys269, lys270, and his463) were conserved for maintaining enzyme catalysis. all amino acid substitutions at these sites either  eliminated or remarkably diminished trpase activity. these sites are thus potential targets for the design of drugs to control the v. cholerae trpase and to further investigate its functions.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == evaluation of the microseq 500 16s rdna-based gene sequencing for the diagnosis of culture-negative bacterial meningitis.
AB  == gene amplification using 16s rdna primers has been proposed as a strategy for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna test (applied biosystems) from  patients with suspected bacterial meningitis and csf negative-culture in comparison to traditional methods. twelve purulent culture-negative csf samples were collected between january 2005 and january 2007. for dna extraction, 500 microl of csf samples were treated using the qiaamp mini kit (qiagen). the extracted dna was examined amplifying 500 bp at the 5' end of 16s rrna gene using microseq500 16s rdna bacterial identification pcr kit and the sequencing reactions were performed with the microseq500 16s rdna bacterial identification sequencing kit (applied biosystems). the sequences were compared with those available in genbank. for the culture-negative csf samples the microseq 500 16s rdna yielded a positive result in 9 cases (75.0%): three samples were identified  as streptococcus. pneumoniae, three as neisseria meningitidis, and the remaining  3 as haemophilus influenzae, abiotrophia defectiva and porphyromonas gingivalis.  the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna test may improve the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, especially when spinal fluid samples are obtained after  the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

TI  == involvement of periodontopathic anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == increasing evidence has linked the anaerobic bacteria forming periodontopathic biofilms with aspiration pneumonia in elderly persons. in experiments designed to eliminate the potent respiratory pathogens forming biofilms in the oral cavity, we have shown that the mechanical and chemical oral cleansing using povidone-iodine effectively reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae in patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. we confirmed the pathogenicity of periodontopathic anaerobic bacteria for aspiration pneumonia in an experimental mouse model. based upon the finding of the coexistence of porphyromonas gingivalis with treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis lesions, we innoculated a mixed culture of p.  gingivalis and t. denticola into the mouse trachea; the resulting infection induced inflammatory cytokine production and caused pneumonia. in another series  of investigations, professional oral health care (pohc), mainly cleansing administered by dental hygienists once a week for 24 months to elderly persons requiring daily care, resulted in the reduction of the number of total anaerobes, candida albicans, and staphylococcus species and in the number of cases of fatal  aspiration pneumonia. we also found that the pohc treatment of elderly persons for 6 months in the winter season reduced the salivary levels of protease, trypsin-like activity, and neuraminidase and also decreased the frequency of influenza cases.

TI  == cross-reactivity of groel antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we  examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI  == reduction of potential respiratory pathogens by oral hygienic treatment in patients undergoing endotracheal anesthesia.
AB  == purpose: this study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of mechanical and chemical prophylactic oral cleansing treatments for reducing potential respiratory pathogens existing in the oral cavity. methods: thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo oral and maxillofacial surgery that required endotracheal anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups, the oral cleansing group (n = 16) or the noncleansing group (n = 16). culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods were used to detect and enumerate pathogens. oral cleansing was carried out with an electric toothbrush capable of automatically supplying and aspirating povidone-iodine solution before surgery, followed by rinsing twice a day after surgery. cephazolin (3 g x day(-1)) was given to all patients for 5 days after surgery. results: the pcr detection rates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and porphyromonas gingivalis in gargle samples before treatment were 87.5%, 68.8%, 53.1%, and 40.6%, respectively. oral cleansing reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. in contrast, there was no significant reduction of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or p. aeruginosa in subjects who underwent systemic cephazolin administration without oral cleansing. conclusion: the combination of mechanical and chemical oral cleansing resulted in a significant reduction of potential respiratory pathogens  in the oral cavity.

TI  == porphyrin-mediated cell surface heme capture from hemoglobin by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the porphyrin requirements for growth recovery of porphyromonas gingivalis in heme-depleted cultures are investigated. in addition to physiologically relevant  sources of heme, growth recovery is stimulated by a number of noniron porphyrins. these data demonstrate that, as for haemophilus influenzae, reliance on captured  iron and on exogenous porphyrin is manifest as an absolute growth requirement for heme. a number of outer membrane proteins including some gingipains contain the hemoglobin receptor (ha2) domain. in cell surface extracts, polypeptides derived  from ha2-containing proteins predominated in hemoglobin binding. the in vitro porphyrin-binding properties of a recombinant ha2 domain were investigated and found to be iron independent. porphyrins that differ from protoporphyrin ix in only the vinyl aspect of the tetrapyrrole ring show comparable effects in competing with hemoglobin for ha2 and facilitate growth recovery. for some porphyrins which differ from protoporphyrin ix at both propionic acid side chains, the modification is detrimental in both these assays. correlations of porphyrin competition and growth recovery imply that the ha2 domain acts as a high-affinity hemophore at the cell surface to capture porphyrin from hemoglobin. while some proteins involved with heme capture bind directly to the iron center,  the ha2 domain of p. gingivalis recognizes heme by a mechanism that is solely porphyrin mediated.

TI  == molecular analysis of a haemagglutinin of haemophilus paragallinarum.
AB  == the gene encoding a haemagglutinin of h. paragallinarum, haga, has been identified and the full-length nucleotide sequence determined. a approximately 39 kda protein, recognized by an anti-haemagglutinin monoclonal antibody, mab4d, was purified from h. paragallinarum strain 0083 and the n-terminal sequence obtained. the full-length nucleotide sequence was obtained by inverse pcr and the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded was shown to be similar to other outer-membrane proteins of closely related organisms in the hap group (haemophilus, actinobacillus, pasteurella), especially the p5 protein of haemophilus influenzae. the haga gene was cloned into a his-tag expression vector and overexpressed in escherichia coli strain m15(prep4). the identity of the purified recombinant protein as a h. paragallinarum haemagglutinin was confirmed  by haemagglutination of chicken red blood cells and reactivity, in a western blot, with the monoclonal antibody specific for the serovar a haemagglutinin.

TI  == oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). a number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in  the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion  of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. in addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. the resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to  respiratory infection. further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.

TI  == characterization and expression of hmur, a tonb-dependent hemoglobin receptor of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the gram-negative pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis requires hemin for growth. hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin and hemin complexed to hemopexin can be used as heme sources, indicating that p. gingivalis must have a means to remove the hemin from these host iron-binding proteins. however, the specific mechanisms utilized  by p. gingivalis for the extraction of heme from heme-binding proteins and for iron transport are poorly understood. in this study we have determined that a newly identified tonb-dependent hemoglobin-hemin receptor (hmur) is involved in hemoglobin binding and utilization in p. gingivalis a7436. hmur shares amino acid homology with tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, including hemr of  yersinia enterocolitica, shua of shigella dysenteriae, hpub of neisseria gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis, hmbr of n. meningitidis, hgba of haemophilus ducreyi, and hgpb of h. influenzae. southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the hmur gene and revealed genetic variability in the carboxy terminus of hmur in p. gingivalis strains 33277, 381, w50, and 53977. we also identified directly  upstream of the hmur gene a gene which we designated hmuy. upstream of the hmuy start codon, a region with homology to the fur binding consensus sequence was identified. reverse transcription-pcr analysis revealed that hmur and hmuy were cotranscribed and that transcription was negatively regulated by iron. inactivation of hmur resulted in a decreased ability of p. gingivalis to bind hemoglobin and to grow with hemoglobin or hemin as sole iron sources. escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant hmur were shown to bind hemoglobin and hemin. furthermore, purified recombinant hmur was demonstrated to bind hemoglobin. taken together, these results indicate that hmur serves as the major tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor involved in the utilization of both hemin and hemoglobin  in p. gingivalis.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == the use of genomic dna fingerprinting in studies of the epidemiology of bacteria  in periodontitis.
AB  == recent studies of microbial epidemiology emphasizing the genetic organization and distribution of organisms associated with orofacial infections have led to new insights into the possible origins of pathogenicity. studies into genetic heterogeneity, acquisition and transmission of these organisms have been markedly advanced by the utilization of the powerful technique of genomic dna fingerprinting. characteristic fingerprints for each bacterial isolate can be produced by cleavage of high molecular weight genomic dna by restriction endonucleases. it is assumed that each dna fingerprint represents a clonal type.  in this report, we review and analyze studies of the epidemiology of bacteria associated with orofacial infections with an emphasis on periodontal disease. studies of nontypable (nt) haemophilus influenzae associated with recurrent otitis media illustrate the utility of this technique. dna fingerprinting clearly demonstrates genetic heterogeneity of nt h. influenzae isolates, and clonality of infection of any individual. furthermore, dna fingerprinting has shown that the same clonal type is seen in siblings concurrently suffering from otitis media, suggesting horizontal transmission within the family. studies of mutans streptococci also show extensive genetic heterogeneity and show vertical transmission of a predominant clonal type only from mother to infant, but not from father to infant. studies of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans show considerable genetic heterogeneity among monkey isolates. thus far, three clonal  types have been reported with dna fingerprinting among isolates from periodontal  patients, but additional genetic heterogeneity can be found using specific dna fragments as probes in hybridization experiments. intrafamilial transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans has been demonstrated. porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis shows extensive genetic heterogeneity and case reports suggest clonal  infection of any one individual. in contrast, results with dna fingerprinting of  eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides intermedius show that individuals may be infected with 2 or more clonal types. these studies point to the great potential of dna fingerprinting for investigating the epidemiology of putative orofacial pathogens. such studies with periodontal microorganisms will likely reveal steps in the acquisition, intraoral and person-to-person transmission, which then could possibly be inhibited or interfered with to prevent periodontal disease or its recurrence.
