effects of multistrain probiotics on growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient  digestibility, blood characteristics, cecal microbial shedding, and excreta odor contents in broilers.
this experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium butyricum supplementation in broilers. a total of 400 one-day-old mixed sex ross 308 broilers with an initial average bw of 46 +/- 0.5 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment and 20 broilers in each pen for 35 d. dietary treatments were (1) an antibiotic-free diet (con), (2) con + 5 mg/kg of avilamycin, (3) con + 1 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p1), and (4) con + 2 x 10(5) cfu of multistrain probiotics/kg of diet (p2). broilers fed the p1 and p2 diets had greater bw gain than broilers fed the con diet during d 22 to 35 (p = 0.01) and overall (p = 0.02). feed conversion ratios in p1 and p2 were decreased (p = 0.03) compared with that in con from d 22 to 35. ileal digestibility of most essential amino acids, with the exception of his and phe, were increased (p < 0.05) in p1 and p2 compared with con. serum iga and igm concentrations in p2 were higher (p < 0.05) than those in con. the cecal lactobacillus numbers were increased (p = 0.02), and the counts of escherichia coli were decreased (p = 0.03) in p1 and p2 compared with con. dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics decreased (p < 0.05) the excreta nh3 content compared with the con. in conclusion, dietary supplementation with multistrain probiotics improved broiler growth performance, ileal amino acids digestibility, and humoral immunity. furthermore, the probiotics decreased the cecal numbers of e. coli and decreased the nh3 content of excreta.
short communication: jenny milk as an inhibitor of late blowing in cheese: a preliminary report.
late blowing on semihard and hard cheese may have an important economic effect on dairy production. many studies have attempted to prevent this defect by physical treatment, the use of additives, and the use of bacteriocins. in this paper, we look at the effect of jenny milk as an inhibitor of blowing caused by clostridia and coliforms in ewe cheese making. bulk ewe and jenny milk samples were collected in the morning by mechanical milking and were refrigerated at 4 degrees c. on the collected samples, the count of somatic cells, coliforms, clostridium butyricum, and escherichia coli were determined. the bulk raw milk was divided in two 45-l vats: vat 1 was used as a control, whereas 0.5l of jenny milk was added to vat 2. four semihard cheeses, weighing about 2 kg each, were made from each vat. cheese making was replicated twice. after a ripening period of 60 d, the count of coliforms and of c. butyricum was determined. in the treated group, a significant inhibition of coliform bacteria was observed. the addition of jenny milk in cheese making may prove to be a useful and innovative approach for the inhibition of spore-forming clostridia strains.
effects of probiotic, clostridium butyricum, on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens.
four hundred and fifty 1-d-old male lingnan yellow broiler chickens were used to  investigate the effects of clostridium butyricum on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora. the birds were randomly assigned to 5 treatments and offered the same antibiotic-free basal diets for 42 d. the treatments were as follows: no addition (control), 1 x 10(7) cfu c. butyricum/kg of diet (cb1), 2 x 10(7) cfu c. butyricum/kg of diet (cb2), 3 x 10(7) cfu c. butyricum/kg of diet (cb3), and 10 mg of colistine sulfate/kg of diet (antibiotic). birds fed either cb2 or antibiotic had greater overall bw than those in the control group. during d 1 to 7, d 21 to 42, and d 1 to 42, birds fed either cb2 or cb3 or the antibiotic diet had greater adg compared with those in the control group. no significant differences were observed in bw or adg among the cb2, cb3, and antibiotic groups. birds fed the cb2 or cb3 diet had greater concentrations of iga and igg in the serum from d 14 to 42 and greater igm in the serum from d 21 to 42 than those in the control group. birds fed the cb3 diet had a greater concentration of complement component 3 in the serum than those in the control group from d 7 to 42. dietary c. butyricum decreased (p < 0.05) escherichia coli in cecal contents on d 14 and 42, and both cb2 and cb3 decreased (p < 0.05) cecal salmonella and clostridium perfringen from d 14 to 42 compared with the control. broilers fed either cb2 or cb3 had greater cecal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium counts from d 21 to 42, and birds fed c. butyricum had greater cecal c. butyricum counts during the whole period compared with those in the control group. the results indicate that c. butyricum promotes growth performance and immune function and benefits the balance of the intestinal microflora in broiler chickens.
ability of clostridium butyricum to inhibit escherichia coli-induced apoptosis in chicken embryo intestinal cells.
the beneficial effects of clostridium butyricum in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory disorders are well known. however, it is not fully understood how such bacteria inhibit pathogen-induced intestinal diseases. for this purpose, we investigated the effects of c. butyricum and its spent culture supernatants (scs) on escherichia coli (ehec) growth and adherence to chicken embryo intestinal cells (ceics). we also evaluated the potential of c. butyricum to inhibit ehec-induced apoptosis in ceics. c. butyricum and its scs exhibited significant inhibitory activity on ehec growth and adherence to ceics. c. butyricum also showed a significant inhibitory effect on ehec-induced apoptosis by modulating the expression of xiap (x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), bclxl (b-cell lymphoma-extra large), fas, bcl2 (b-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2), bax (bcl-2-associated x protein), p53 (tumor protein 53) and via inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. these results together indicate that c. butyricum possesses the ability to prevent ehec-induced intestinal disorders both directly, through inhibiting ehec viability, and indirectly, via medicating ehec-induced apoptosis. these observations may help explain the beneficial properties of c. butyricum. furthermore, our data is novel in the case of poultry and the manner in which c. butyricum prevents the ehec-induced apoptosis provides supportive information for the treatment of colibacillosis in poultry.
genetic manipulation of butyrate formation pathways in clostridium butyricum.
clostridium butyricum is one of the commonly used species for fermentative hydrogen production. while producing h(2), it can produce acids (lactic, acetic and butyric acids) and co(2), as well as a small amount of ethanol. it has been proposed that elimination of competing pathways, such as the butyrate formation pathway, should increase h(2) yields in clostridium species. however, the application of this strategy has been hindered by the unavailability of genetic tools for these organisms. in this study, we successfully transferred a plasmid (pmtl007) to c. butyricum by inter-specific conjugation with escherichia coli and disrupted hbd, the gene encoding beta-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase in c. butyricum. fermentation data showed that inactivation of hbd in c. butyricum eliminated the butyrate formation pathway, resulting in a significant increase in ethanol production and an obvious decrease in h(2) yield compared with the wild type strain. however, under low partial pressure of h(2), the hbd-deficient strain showed increased h(2) production with the simultaneous decrease of ethanol production, indicating that h(2) production by c. butyricum may compete for nadh with the ethanol formation pathway. together with the discovery of a potential bifurcating hydrogenase, this study extends our understanding of the mechanism of h(2) production by c. butyricum.
sequence analysis of a bacteriocinogenic plasmid of clostridium butyricum and expression of the bacteriocin gene in escherichia coli.
a small cryptic plasmid, namely, pcbm588, was obtained from clostridium butyricum miyairi 588 (cbm588)--a bacterium used in probiotics. the complete sequence of pcbm588 was determined. the size of pcbm588 was 8060 bp and the g + c content was 24.3%. nine open reading frames (orfs) were predicted, and orf3 showed significant homologies with a structural bacteriocin gene of clostridium tyrobutyricum. the putative bacteriocin gene was inserted into the pet21d expression vector in frame; it was expressed as a his-tagged recombinant protein in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). a total of 10240au of the recombinant bacteriocin were purified from 100 ml of e. coli culture. the bacteriocin was cleaved into 2 portions, and the small c-terminal polypeptide consisting of 83 amino acids possessed bactericidal activity. these results demonstrated that the orf3 of pcbm588 encoded a bacteriocin, which is identical or very similar to the previously reported butyricin 7423.
the relationship between instability of h2 production and compositions of bacterial communities within a dark fermentation fluidized-bed bioreactor.
microbial community composition dynamics was studied during h(2) fermentation from glucose in a fluidized-bed bioreactor (fbr) aiming at obtaining insight into the h(2) fermentation microbiology and factors resulting in the instability of biofilm processes. fbr h(2) production performance was characterised by an instable pattern of prompt onset of h(2) production followed by rapid decrease. gradual enrichment of organisms increased the diversity of fbr attached and suspended-growth phase bacterial communities during the operation. fbr bacteria included potential h(2) producers, h(2) consumers and neither h(2) producers nor consumers, and those distantly related to any known organisms. the prompt onset of h(2) production was due to rapid growth of clostridium butyricum (99-100%) affiliated strains after starting continuous feed. the proportion trend of c. butyricum in fbr attached and suspended-growth phase communities coincided with h(2) and butyrate production. high glucose loading rate favoured the h(2) production by escherichia coli (100%) affiliated strain. decrease in h(2) production, associated with a shift from acetate-butyrate to acetate-propionate production, was due to changes in fbr attached and suspended-growth phase bacterial community compositions. during the shift, organisms, including potential propionate producers, were enriched in the communities while the proportion trend of c. butyricum decreased. we suggest that the instability of h(2) fermentation in biofilm reactors is due to enrichment and efficient adhesion of h(2) consumers on the carrier and, therefore, biofilm reactors may not favour mesophilic h(2) fermentation.
the effect of probiotic treatment with clostridium butyricum on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 infection in mice.
enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 has been considered as an agent responsible for outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. we examined the effect of the probiotic agent clostridium butyricum miyairi strain 588 on ehec o157:h7 infections in vitro and in vivo using gnotobiotic mice. the growth of ehec o157:h7 and the production of shiga-like toxins in broth cultures were inhibited by co-incubation with c. butyricum. the antibacterial effects of butyric and lactic acid were demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, the inhibitory effect of butyric acid on the viability of ehec was demonstrated not only at low ph, but also at neutral ph adjusted to 7.0. flowcytometric analysis showed that pre-incubation of caco-2 cells with c. butyricum and e. coli k12 inhibited the adhesion of ehec o157:h7. however, the effect of c. butyricum on adhesion of ehec to caco-2 cells was more inhibitory than that of e. coli k12. gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with ehec o157:h7 died within 4-7 days after the infection. on the other hand, all gnotobiotic mice prophylactically pre-treated with c. butyricum survived exposure to ehec o157:h7 and of the gnotobiotic mice therapeutically post-treated with c. butyricum, 50% survived. both counts of ehec o157:h7 and the amounts of shiga-like toxins (stx1 and stx2) in fecal contents of gnotobiotic mice di-associated with ehec o157:h7 and c. butyricum were less than those of gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with ehec o157:h7. these results indicated that the probiotic bacterium c. butyricum miyairi strain 588 has preventive and therapeutic effects on ehec o157:h7 infection in gnotobiotic mice.
does probiotics administration decrease serum endotoxin levels in infants?
purpose: the aim of this study was to examine whether administration of probiotics to infants can change the ratio of intestinal flora and thereby decrease serum endotoxin produced by potentially pathogenic microorganisms. methods: nine infants including five with of biliary atresia, two with omphalocele, one each with hirschsprung's disease and imperforate anus were studied. all patients were stable, and no antibiotics were given during this study. a probiotic mixture consisting of streptococcus faecalis, clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesentericus was administered orally to each infant at 2 g/day for 2 weeks. fecal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, serum endotoxin level, and other biochemical parameters were examined. results: in fecal cultures, anaerobic bacteria including bifidobacterium increased significantly whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus, and klebsiella tended to decrease. the ratio of anaerobic to aerobic bacteria increased five times as a result of administration of probiotics, and serum endotoxin levels decreased. conclusions: probiotics affect intestinal bacterial flora by increasing anaerobic bacteria and decreasing the population of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. a decrease in luminal endotoxin may result in less endotoxin translocation or bacterial translocation.
inhibition of the autoxidation of ascorbate and norepinephrine by extracts of clostridium butyricum, megasphaera elsdenii and escherichia coli.
the autoxidation of ascorbate and of norepinephrine in krebs ringer phosphate medium, ph 7.4, was studied. the autoxidation of the two substances was determined spectrophotometrically at 265 and 480 nm respectively. the effect of dialyzed extracts (m.w. greater than 12,000) from escherichia coli (aerobe), megasphaera elsdenii, and clostridium butyricum (obligate anaerobes) was examined and compared to similarly prepared extracts from rat serum and cerebral cortex. the assay medium contained cellular components diluted 10(3)-10(6)-fold. up to 10(4)-fold dilution there was a substantial reduction in the rate of both autoxidation reactions, but the preparations from m. elsdenii and c. butyricum were conspicuously less effective. after 5 min heat treatment at 100 degrees c the anaerobic preparations produced less than 20% inhibition, while the activity of the other preparations remained unchanged at 75-95% inhibition. these and earlier experiments involving additional mammalian species (mishra and kovachich, neurosci. lett., 43: 103-108, 1983) and plants (mishra and kovachich, life sci., 34: 2207-2212, 1984) suggest that a high level of heat-stable antioxidant activity in one or both of these autoxidation tests (denatured plant extracts only inhibit ascorbate autoxidation) is a general characteristic of organisms that thrive in oxygen-rich atmosphere.
