TI  - Overexpression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction of the nisin resistance protein from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Nisin is a 34-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactococcus lactis belonging to the class of lantibiotics. Nisin displays a high bactericidal activity against various Gram-positive bacteria, including some human-pathogenic strains. However, there are some nisin-non-producing strains that are naturally resistant owing to the presence of the nsr gene within their genome. The encoded protein, NSR, cleaves off the last six amino acids of nisin, thereby reducing its bactericidal efficacy. An expression and purification protocol has been established for the NSR protein from Streptococcus agalactiae COH1. The protein was successfully crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method in hanging and sitting drops, resulting in crystals that diffracted X-rays to 2.8 and 2.2 A, respectively.
TI  - Impact of Cell-free Supernatant of Lactic Acid Bacteria on Putrescine and Other Polyamine Formation by Foodborne Pathogens in Ornithine Decarboxylase Broth.
AB  - Conversion of ornithine to putrescine by Salmonella Paratyphi A, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli was investigated in ornithine decarboxylase broth (ODB) using cell-free supernatants (CFSs) obtained from Leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus. Two groups of cell-free supernatants (25 or 50%) and control (only ODB) were prepared to investigate putrescine (PUT) and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens (FBPs). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed among the species for each amine. All of the CFSs reduced the formation of PUT by >/=65%. The production of cadaverine (CAD) was scarcely affected by the presence of CFSs, with the exception of the samples inoculated with L. monocytogenes. The variation in polyamine was found with respect to the control samples. Spermidine (SPD) was produced in lower amount in many samples, especially in Gram-negative FBPs, whereas spermine (SPN) increased drastically in the major part of the samples concerning the control. Histamine (HIS) was characterized by a marked concentration decrease in all of the samples, and tyramine (TYR) was accumulated in very low concentrations in the controls. Therefore, the ability of bacteria to produce certain biogenic amines such as HIS, TYR, PUT, and CAD has been studied to assess their risk and prevent their formation in food products. The results obtained from this study concluded that the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains with non-decarboxylase activity are capable of avoiding or limiting biogenic amine formation by FBP.
TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Streptococcus gordonii DL1 adhesin SspB V-region mediates coaggregation via receptor polysaccharide of Actinomyces oris T14V.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii SspA and SspB proteins, members of the antigen I/II (AgI/II) family of Streptococcus adhesins, mediate adherence to cysteine-rich scavenger glycoprotein gp340 and cells of other oral microbial species. In this article we investigated further the mechanism of coaggregation between S. gordonii DL1 and Actinomyces oris T14V. Previous mutational analysis of S. gordonii suggested that SspB was necessary for coaggregation with A. oris T14V. We have confirmed this by showing that Lactococcus lactis surrogate host cells expressing SspB coaggregated with A. oris T14V and PK606 cells, while L. lactis cells expressing SspA did not. Coaggregation occurred independently of expression of A. oris type 1 (FimP) or type 2 (FimA) fimbriae. Polysaccharide was prepared from cells of A. oris T14V and found to contain 1,4-, 4,6- and 3,4-linked glucose, 1,4-linked mannose, and 2,4-linked galactose residues. When immobilized onto plastic wells this polysaccharide supported binding of L. lactis expressing SspB, but not binding of L. lactis expressing other AgI/II family proteins. Purified recombinant NAVP region of SspB, comprising amino acid (aa) residues 41-847, bound A. oris polysaccharide but the C-domain (932-1470 aa residues) did not. A site-directed deletion of 29 aa residues (Delta691-718) close to the predicted binding cleft within the SspB V-region ablated binding of the NAVP region to polysaccharide. These results infer that the V-region head of SspB recognizes an actinomyces polysaccharide ligand, so further characterizing a lectin-like coaggregation mechanism occurring between two important primary colonizers.
TI  - A tyrosine phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between the transmembrane modulator protein Wzd and the tyrosine kinase Wze of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One proposed mechanism for assembly of secreted heteropolysaccharides by many Gram positive bacteria relies on the coordinated action of a polymerization complex through reversible phosphorylation events. The role of the tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator is, however, not well understood. RESULTS: The protein sequences deduced from the wzb, wzd and wze genes from Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 9595 and RW-9595 M contain motifs also found in corresponding proteins CpsB, CpsC and CpsD from Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 (serotype 2). Use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both Wzd and Wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form. When tyrosine 266 was mutated to phenylalanine, WzdY266F showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated Wzd genes, when expressed along with Wze and Wzb in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. In order to demonstrate the importance of ATP for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion Wzb, Wzd and Wze proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cultures. The modulator protein, Wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase Wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status. However, Wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated Wzd in the presence of 10 mM ATP. This highly phosphorylated Wze did not remain in close association with phosphorylated Wzd. CONCLUSION: The Wze tyrosine kinase protein of Lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of Wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.
TI  - Bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different Italian regions.
AB  - Kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. The microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. The aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some Italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing. The main bacterial species found was Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while Dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. The presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Acetobacter genera was also highlighted. In addition, Lc. lactis, Enterococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Acetobacter fabarum, Acetobacter lovaniensis and Acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. This work further confirms both the importance of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16S rRNA gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification approaches.
TI  - Nisin-induced expression of a recombinant antihypertensive peptide in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve the process for the production of milk-derived antihypertensive peptides, including a 12-residue peptide (FFVAPFPECVGK) from alphaS1-casein. RESULTS: A synthetic gene encoding this peptide was cloned within the pediocin operon, replacing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature pediocin peptide (papA) and resulting in a translational fusion between the pediocin leader peptide and the 12-residue hypotensive (C-12) peptide. The recombinant operon was subsequently cloned immediately downstream of the nisA promoter to allow for inducible gene expression within Streptococcus thermophilus ST128, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 and Lactobacillus casei C2. RT-PCR was used to confirm recombinant gene expression in complex medium; and SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the pediocin secretion machinery, encoded by papC and papD, allowed for secretion of the recombinant peptide from both L. lactis ML3 and L. casei C2 in a chemically defined medium. CONCLUSION: The use of a nisin as a "food-grade" inducer molecule, and generally-regarded-as-safe LAB species suggests that this system could be used for the production of functional food ingredients.
TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - Excess of threonine compared with serine promotes threonine aldolase activity in  Lactococcus lactis IL1403.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is an important lactic acid starter for food production as well as a cell factory for production of food grade additives, among which natural flavour production is one of the main interests of food producers. Flavour production is associated with the degradation of amino acids and comprehensive studies are required to elucidate mechanisms behind these pathways. In this study using chemically defined medium, labelled substrate and steady-state cultivation, new data for the catabolism of threonine in Lc. lactis have been obtained. The biosynthesis of glycine in this organism is associated with the catabolic pathways of glucose and serine. Nevertheless, if threonine concentration in the growth environment exceeds that of serine, threonine becomes the main source for glycine biosynthesis and the utilization of serine decreases. Also, the conversion of threonine to glycine was initiated by a threonine aldolase and this was the principal pathway used for threonine degradation. As in Streptococcus thermophilus, serine hydroxymethyltransferase in Lc. lactis may possess a secondary activity as threonine aldolase. Other catabolic pathways of threonine (e.g. threonine dehydrogenase and threonine dehydratase) were not detected.
TI  - Pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from Northwestern Argentina.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from Northwestern Argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at Maimara (chicha M) and Tumbaya (chicha T). Whereas by culture-dependent approach a few number of species (Lactobacillus plantarum and Weissella viridescens in chicha M, and Enterococcus faecium and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha T) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. The relative abundance of OTUs was higher in chicha M than in chicha T; six LAB genera were common for chicha M and T: Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus while Pediococcus only was detected in chicha M. Among the 46 identified LAB species, those of Lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas Enterococcus and Leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha T and M, respectively. Identification at species level showed the predominance of Lb. plantarum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Leuconostoc lactis and W. viridescens in chicha M while Enterococcus hirae, E. faecium, Lc. mesenteroides and Weissella confusa predominated in chicha T samples. In parallel, when presumptive LAB isolates (chicha M: 146; chicha T: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by ISR-PCR and RAPD-PCR profiles, species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the Leuconostoc genus (Lc. mesenteroides and Lc. lactis) in chicha M, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus being also present. In contrast, chicha T exhibited the presence of Enterococcus and Leuconostoc, E. faecium being the most representative species. Massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. Although differences in the LAB species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant LAB species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. The fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on LAB population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.
TI  - Acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of plasmid pSMA198 by Streptococcus  macedonicus ACA-DC 198 points towards the dairy origin of the species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to Streptococcus thermophilus. However, S. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the pSMA198 plasmid isolated from the dairy strain Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. pSMA198 belongs to the narrow host range pCI305/pWV02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. Comparative analysis of the pSMA198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from Lactococcus lactis strains deriving from milk or its products. Phylogenetic analysis of the pSMA198 Rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. Additionally, cloning of the pSMA198 ori in L. lactis revealed a 100% stability of replication over 100 generations. Both pSMA198 and the chromosome of S. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes, indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. We identified chromosomal regions in S. macedonicus that may have originated from pSMA198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. pSMA198 was also found in divergent biotypes of S. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. Greece and Switzerland) showing that pSMA198's acquisition is not a recent event. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Here we propose that S. macedonicus acquired plasmid pSMA198 from L. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. We provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.
TI  - Effect of adjuncts on microbiological and chemical properties of Scamorza cheese.
AB  - Scamorza is a semi-hard, pasta filata cheese resembling low-moisture Mozzarella cheese, with a short ripening time (<30d). Scamorza has a bland flavor and, to provide diversification from similar cheeses, it was manufactured using 2 types of milk in the current study: 100% Italian Friesian milk (F) or 90% F and 10% Jersey cow milk (mixed, M), and 2 types of starter: Streptococcus thermophilus or S. thermophilus with peptidolytic Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lactobacillus paracasei strains as adjuncts). The cheeses were ripened for 30d. The adjunct did not significantly affect acid production or growth of the primary starter; 2 of the species used in the adjunct (Lb. paracasei and Lb. helveticus) rapidly colonized the cheese and persisted until the end of ripening, whereas the counts of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in the control cheese were low until the end of ripening. The use of adjuncts affected pH, microbial composition (as assessed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods), total free amino acid content, and volatile profile (measured using an electronic nose), whereas milk type had only a minor effect. Although differences in primary proteolysis were found, they were probably indirect and related to the effects on pH and moisture. We conclude that, even with a short ripening time (30d), use of a peptidolytic adjunct may significantly affect important features of Scamorza and may be used to create a product that is measurably different from competing products.
TI  - Group B Streptococcus pili mediate adherence to salivary glycoproteins.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis, pneumonia and  meningitis, and is responsible for a rising number of severe invasive infections in adults. For all disease manifestations, colonisation is a critical first step. GBS has frequently been isolated from the oropharynx of neonates and adults. However, little is understood about the mechanisms of GBS colonisation at this site. In this study it is shown that three GBS strains (COH1, NEM316, 515) have capacity to adhere to human salivary pellicle. Heterologous expression of GBS pilus island (PI) genes in Lactococcus lactis to form surface-expressed pili demonstrated that GBS PI-2a and PI-1 pili bound glycoprotein-340 (gp340), a component of salivary pellicle. By contrast, PI-2b pili did not interact with gp340. The variation was attributable to differences in capacities for backbone and ancillary protein subunits of each pilus to bind gp340. Furthermore, while GBS strains were aggregated by fluid-phase gp340, this mechanism was not mediated by pili, which displayed specificity for immobilised gp340. Thus pili may enable GBS to colonise the soft and hard tissues of the oropharynx, while evading an innate mucosal defence, with implications for risk of progression to severe diseases such as meningitis and sepsis.
TI  - Influenza viral neuraminidase primes bacterial coinfection through TGF-beta-mediated expression of host cell receptors.
AB  - Influenza infection predisposes the host to secondary bacterial pneumonia, which  is a major cause of mortality during influenza epidemics. The molecular mechanisms underlying the bacterial coinfection remain elusive. Neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A virus (IAV) enhances bacterial adherence and also activates TGF-beta. Because TGF-beta can up-regulate host adhesion molecules such as fibronectin and integrins for bacterial binding, we hypothesized that activated TGF-beta during IAV infection contributes to secondary bacterial infection by up-regulating these host adhesion molecules. Flow cytometric analyses of a human lung epithelial cell line indicated that the expression of fibronectin and alpha5 integrin was up-regulated after IAV infection or treatment with recombinant NA and was reversed through the inhibition of TGF-beta signaling. IAV-promoted adherence of group A Streptococcus (GAS) and other coinfective pathogens that require fibronectin for binding was prevented significantly by the inhibition of TGF-beta. However, IAV did not promote the adherence of Lactococcus lactis unless this bacterium expressed the fibronectin-binding protein of GAS. Mouse experiments showed that IAV infection enhanced GAS colonization in the lungs of wild-type animals but not in the lungs of mice deficient in TGF-beta signaling. Taken together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism: IAV NA enhances the expression of cellular adhesins through the activation of TGF-beta, leading to increased bacterial loading in the lungs. Our results suggest that TGF-beta and cellular adhesins may be potential pharmaceutical targets for the prevention of coinfection.
TI  - The influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The function of cell-free solutions (CFSs) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (FBPs) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) using HPLC. Cell free solutions were prepared from four LAB strains. Two different concentrations which were 50% (5 ml CFS+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml CFS+7.5 ml medium/1:3) CFS and the control without CFS were prepared. Both concentration of CFS of Streptococcus thermophilus and 50% CFS of Pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by Salmonella paratyphi A. Tyramine production by Escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% CFS of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% CFS of Leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. The inhibitor effect of 50% CFS of P. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by Listeria monocytogenes, following Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% CFS of Leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). The stimulation effects of 50% CFS of S. thermophilus and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by Staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. CFS of LAB strains showed statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased pH quickly and reduced the formation of AMN and BAs. Consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use CFS for food and food products.
TI  - Effect of adjuncts on sensory properties and consumer liking of Scamorza cheese.
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peptidolytic adjunct (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lactobacillus paracasei), as a tool to accelerate ripening, on sensory properties and acceptability of Scamorza cheese obtained using 2 types of milk (Friesian and Friesian+Jersey) and Streptococcus thermophilus as primary starter. A 10-member panel was trained using a specific frame of references and used a specific vocabulary to assess cheese sensory properties through quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA), whereas 87 consumers were used to evaluate product acceptability. Analysis of variance showed that milk type did not markedly alter cheese sensory properties. Conversely, panelists perceived higher intensities of butter, saltiness, and sweetness flavors in cheese without adjunct culture (ST), whereas the addition of the adjunct culture (ST+A) induced higher and sourness flavors, oiliness and grainy textures, and lower adhesiveness, moisture, springiness, and tenderness. Principal component analysis showed positive relationships between pH and tenderness, sweetness and saltiness and a negative correlation between pH and grainy, oiliness, color and structure uniformity, sourness, and milk. Most of the differences observed in QDA and most of the relationships observed in the principal component analysis were linked to the higher microbial activity induced by the adjunct culture. Independently of milk and starter types, consumers perceived Scamorza cheese as characterized by a good eating quality (mean liking scores were all above the neutral point of the hedonic scale). Although ST cheeses showed higher values for overall liking, 2 homogeneous groups of consumers were identified using partial least squares regression analysis. One group preferred ST cheeses with higher levels of tenderness, adhesiveness, springiness, and moisture in terms of texture, butter in terms of flavor, and sweetness in terms of taste, whereas a second group preferred ST+A products characterized by specific attributes of texture (cohesiveness and oiliness), flavor (milk), taste (sourness), and appearance (structure and color uniformity). We conclude that further studies for the development of short-ripened products based on the use of adjunct cultures should be conducted to promote product differentiation and meet the sensory requirements of particular segments of consumers.
TI  - Classification of Lactococcus lactis cell envelope proteinase based on gene sequencing, peptides formed after hydrolysis of milk, and computer modeling.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis strains depend on a proteolytic system for growth in milk to release essential AA from casein. The cleavage specificities of the cell envelope proteinase (CEP) can vary between strains and environments and whether the enzyme is released or bound to the cell wall. Thirty-eight Lc. lactis strains were grouped according to their CEP AA sequences and according to identified peptides after hydrolysis of milk. Finally, AA positions in the substrate binding region were suggested by the use of a new CEP template based on Streptococcus C5a CEP. Aligning the CEP AA sequences of 38 strains of Lc. lactis showed that 21 strains, which were previously classified as group d, could be subdivided into 3 groups. Independently, similar subgroupings were found based on comparison of the Lc. lactis CEP AA sequences and based on normalized quantity of identified peptides released from alphaS1-casein and beta-casein. A model structure of Lc. lactis CEP based on the crystal structure of Streptococcus C5a CEP was used to investigate the AA positions in the substrate-binding region. New AA positions were suggested, which could be relevant for the cleavage specificity of CEP; however, these could only explain 2 out of 3 found subgroups. The third subgroup could be explained by 1 to 5 AA positions located opposite the substrate binding region.
TI  - Optimization of fluorescent tools for cell biology studies in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The understanding of how Gram-positive bacteria divide and ensure the correct localization of different molecular machineries, such as those involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell surface, is crucial to design strategies to fight bacterial infections. In order to determine the correct subcellular localization of fluorescent proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae, we have previously described tools to express derivatives of four fluorescent proteins, mCherry, Citrine, CFP and GFP, to levels that allow visualization by fluorescence microscopy, by fusing the first ten amino acids of the S. pneumoniae protein Wze (the i-tag), upstream of the fluorescent protein. Here, we report that these tools can also be used in other Gram-positive bacteria, namely Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, possibly due to optimized translation rates. Additionally, we have optimized the i-tag by testing the effect of the first ten amino acids of other pneumococcal proteins in the increased expression of the fluorescent protein Citrine. We found that manipulating the structure and stability of the 5' end of the mRNA molecule, which may influence the accessibility of the ribosome, is determinant to ensure the expression of a strong fluorescent signal.
TI  - Endocytosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor of epithelial cells relies on clathrin and caveolin dependent mechanisms.
AB  - Colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) is a prerequisite for bacterial dissemination and their capability to enter the bloodstream. Pneumococci have evolved various successful strategies to colonize the mucosal epithelial barrier of humans. A pivotal mechanism of host cell invasion implicated with invasive diseases is promoted by the interaction of pneumococcal PspC with the polymeric Ig-receptor (pIgR). However, the mechanism(s) of pneumococcal endocytosis and the intracellular route of pneumococci upon uptake by the PspC-pIgR-interaction are not known. Here, we demonstrate by using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors and genetics interference approaches the involvement of active dynamin-dependent caveolae and clathrin-coated vesicles for pneumococcal uptake via the PspC-pIgR mechanism. Depleting cholesterol from host cell membranes and disruption of lipid microdomains impaired pneumococcal internalization. Moreover, chemical inhibition of clathrin or functional inactivation of dynamin, caveolae or clathrin by RNA interference significantly affected pneumococcal internalization suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and caveolae are involved in the bacterial uptake process. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of pIgR-expressing epithelial cells infected with pneumococci or heterologous Lactococcus lactis expressing PspC demonstrated bacterial co-localization with fluorescent-tagged clathrin and early as well as recycling or late endosomal markers such as Lamp1, Rab5, Rab4, and Rab7, respectively. In conclusion these data suggest that PspC-promoted uptake is mediated by both CME and caveolae. After endocytosis pneumococci are routed via the endocytic pathway into early endosomes and are then sorted into recycling or late endosomes, which can result in pneumococcal killing in phagolysosomes or transcytosis via recycling endosomes.
TI  - The effects of combined dietary probiotics Lactococcus lactis BFE920 and Lactobacillus plantarum FGL0001 on innate immunity and disease resistance in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).
AB  - The effects of a dietary probiotic mixture containing Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis BFE920 isolated from bean sprout and autochthonous Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum FGL0001 originally isolated from the hindgut of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) were investigated for the purpose of improving the probiotic effects of Lc. lactis BFE920 on the olive flounder. The immunostimulatory, disease protective, and weight gain effects of Lc. lactis BFE920 were significantly improved when olive flounder (average weight 37.5+/-1.26 g) were fed the probiotic mixture (log10 7.0 CFU each/g feed pellet) for 30 days. Flounder fed the mixture showed improved skin mucus lysozyme activity and phagocytic activity of innate immune cells compared to flounder fed a single probiotic agent or a control diet. While the levels of neutrophil activity in flounder fed the single probiotic agent or the mixture were similar, they were significantly higher than levels in a control group. Additionally, probiotic-fed flounder showed significantly increased expressions of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in the intestine compared to the control group. Following a 30-day period of being fed probiotics or a control diet, the olive flounder were challenged with an i.p. injection of Streptococcus iniae (log10 6.0 CFU/fish). The groups fed the mixed probiotics, Lc. lactis BFE920, Lb. plantarum FGL0001, and the control diet had survival rates of 55%, 45%, 35%, and 20%, respectively. Flounder fed the probiotic mixture gained 38.1+/-2.8% more body weight compared to flounder fed the control diet during the 30-day study period. These data strongly suggest that a mixture of Lc. lactis BFE920 and Lb. plantarum FGL0001 may serve as an immunostimulating feed additive useful for disease protection in the fish farming industry.
TI  - Constructing a recombinant hyaluronic acid biosynthesis operon and producing food-grade hyaluronic acid in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural high molecular weight polysaccharide, is produced by Streptococcus zooepidemicus. However, Streptococcus has several drawbacks including its potential to produce exotoxins, so there is demand for an alternative HA source. Here, a recombinant HA biosynthesis operon, as well as the HA biosynthesis operon of S. zooepidemicus were introduced into L. lactis using the nisin-controlled expression system, respectively. HA was successfully synthesized by recombinant L. lactis. Furthermore, overexpression of the endogenous enzymes directing the synthesis of precursor sugars was effective at increasing HA production, and increasing the supply of UDP-activated monosaccharide donors aided synthesis of monodisperse HA polysaccharides. Besides GRAS host strain (L. lactis) and NICE system, the selecting marker (lacF gene) of the recombinant strain is also food grade. Therefore, HA produced by recombinant L. lactis overcomes the problems associated with Streptococcus and provides a source of food-grading HA appropriate for widespread biotechnological applications.
TI  - Effects of synbiotics injected in ovo on regulation of immune-related gene expression in adult chickens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine immunomodulatory effects of synbiotics administered in ovo on immune-related gene expression in adult chickens. ANIMALS: 30 Green-legged Partridgelike chickens. PROCEDURES: On incubation day 12, eggs were injected with 3 synbiotics (Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis IBB SL1 with raffinose family oligosaccharides [RFOs; S1], Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris IBB SC1 with RFOs [S2], and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium with lactose [S3]). Control eggs were injected with RFOs prebiotic or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Gene expression of 6 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-18, interferon [IFN]-beta, and IFN-gamma) and 1 chemokine (IL-8) was analyzed in the cecal tonsils and spleen of 6-week-old chickens by means of reverse transcription quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: Gene expression for IL-4, IL-6, IFN-beta, and IL-18 was significantly upregulated in the spleen of chickens in groups S2 and S3. In contrast, IL-12 expression was downregulated in group S2 and IFN-gamma expression was downregulated in group S3. Expression of IL-8 did not change in chickens treated with synbiotics in ovo. Gene expression of all cytokines, except for IL-18, was downregulated in cecal tonsils. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In ovo administration of synbiotics activated the immune system in adult chickens. The intestinal immune system (cecal tonsils) had downregulation of expression for the cytokines evaluated, which indicated an increase in oral tolerance, whereas in the peripheral part of the immune system (spleen), expression of IL-4 and IL-6 was upregulated. Evaluation of immune-related gene expression patterns may be useful when monitoring the effectiveness of synbiotic selection with respect to immunobiotic properties.
TI  - Short communication: Genotypic and phenotypic identification of environmental streptococci and association of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis with intramammary infections among different dairy farms.
AB  - Lactococcus species are counted among a large and closely related group of environmental streptococci and streptococci-like bacteria that include bovine mastitis pathogenic Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Aerococcus species. Phenotypic and biochemical identification methods can be inaccurate and unreliable for species within this group, particularly for Lactococcus spp. As a result, the incidence of Lactococcus spp. on the farm may have been historically underreported and consequently little is known about the clinical importance of this genus as a mastitis pathogen. We used molecular genetic identification methods to accurately differentiate 60 environmental streptococci and streptococci-like bacteria isolated from cows with high somatic cell count and chronic intramammary infection (IMI; >2 somatic cell scores above 4) among 5 geographically distinct farms in New York and Minnesota that exhibited an observed increase in IMI. These isolates were phenotypically identified as Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus spp. Genetic methods identified 42 isolates (70%) as Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, including all 10 isolates originally phenotypically identified as Streptococcus uberis. Antibiotic inhibition testing of all Lc. lactis ssp. lactis showed that 7 isolates were resistant to tetracycline. In the present study, a predominance of Lc. lactis ssp. lactis was identified in association with chronic, clinical bovine IMI among all 5 farms and characterized antimicrobial resistance for treatment therapies. Routine use by mastitis testing labs of molecular identification methods for environmental streptococci and streptococci-like bacteria can further define the role and prevalence of Lc. lactis ssp. lactis in association with bovine IMI and may lead to more targeted therapies.
TI  - Binding of vitronectin and Factor H to Hic contributes to immune evasion of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 strains are highly resistant to opsonophagocytosis due to recruitment of the complement inhibitor Factor H via Hic, a member of the pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) family. In this study, we demonstrated that Hic also interacts with vitronectin, a fluid-phase regulator involved in haemostasis, angiogenesis, and the terminal complement cascade as well as a component of the extracellular matrix. Blocking of Hic by specific antiserum or genetic deletion significantly reduced pneumococcal binding to soluble and immobilised vitronectin and to Factor H, respectively. In parallel, ectopic expression of Hic on the surface of Lactococcus lactis conferred binding to soluble and immobilised vitronectin as well as Factor H. Molecular analyses with truncated Hic fragments narrowed down the vitronectin-binding site to the central core of Hic (aa 151-201). This vitronectin-binding region is separate from that of Factor H, which binds to the N-terminus of Hic (aa 38-92). Binding of pneumococcal Hic was localised to the C-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD3) of vitronectin. However, an N-terminal region to HBD3 was further involved in Hic-binding to immobilised vitronectin. Finally, vitronectin bound to Hic was functionally active and inhibited formation of the terminal complement complex. In conclusion, Hic interacts with vitronectin and simultaneously with Factor H, and both human proteins may contribute to colonisation and invasive disease caused by serotype 3 pneumococci.
TI  - Control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain Enterococcus faecalis EF37 and the histamine producing strain Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). The results showed that the three L. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 and EG46 produced, respectively, nisin Z and lacticin 481, while for the strains CG27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. The co-culture of E. faecalis EF37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of E. faecalis. Tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when E. faecalis EF37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. All the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with E. faecalis EF37; in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 induced the death of S. thermophilus PRI60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). The other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against S. thermophilus PRI60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if L. lactis subsp. lactis EG46 was less effective when the initial streptococci concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. This preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate BA and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on BA production on the same strain. This knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.
TI  - Cell wall-anchored nuclease of Streptococcus sanguinis contributes to escape from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated bacteriocidal activity.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguinis, a member of the commensal mitis group of streptococci, is a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, and has been implicated in infectious complications including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. During disease progression, S. sanguinis may utilize various cell surface molecules to evade the host immune system to survive in blood. In the present study, we discovered a novel cell surface nuclease with a cell-wall anchor domain, termed SWAN (streptococcal wall-anchored nuclease), and investigated its contribution to bacterial resistance against the bacteriocidal activity of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Recombinant SWAN protein (rSWAN) digested multiple forms of DNA including NET DNA and human RNA, which required both Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) for optimum activity. Furthermore, DNase activity of S. sanguinis was detected around growing colonies on agar plates containing DNA. In-frame deletion of the swan gene mostly reduced that activity. These findings indicated that SWAN is a major nuclease displayed on the surface, which was further confirmed by immuno-detection of SWAN in the cell wall fraction. The sensitivity of S. sanguinis to NET killing was reduced by swan gene deletion. Moreover, heterologous expression of the swan gene rendered a Lactococcus lactis strain more resistant to NET killing. Our results suggest that the SWAN nuclease on the bacterial surface contributes to survival in the potential situation of S. sanguinis encountering NETs during the course of disease progression.
TI  - A novel live vector group A streptococcal emm type 9 vaccine delivered intranasally protects mice against challenge infection with emm type 9 group A streptococci.
AB  - The availability of a protective vaccine against Streptococcus pyogenes (group A  Streptococcus [GAS]) is a priority for public health worldwide. Here, we have generated six live vaccine strains, each engineered to express an N-terminal M protein peptide from one of six of the most prevalent emm types of GAS (M1, M2, M4, M9, M12, and M28). The vaccine strains are based on a food-grade Lactococcus lactis strain and do not bear any antibiotic resistance. Mice immunized with the vaccine strain expressing the M9 peptide (termed here the L. lactis M9 strain) showed high titers of serum antibodies when delivered intranasally. Mice immunized with the L. lactis M9 strain were protected against infection after intranasal challenge with type 9 streptococci. Several parameters of disease, such as weight loss, body temperature, colony counts in mouth washes, and lung histology, were significantly improved in immunized mice compared to naive control mice. Our results indicate that intranasal delivery of the L. lactis M9 strain live bacterial vaccine induced GAS-specific IgG titers, prevented pharyngeal colonization of GAS, and protected mice from disease upon challenge. The design of this vaccine prototype may provide a lower cost alternative to vaccines comprised of purified recombinant proteins.
TI  - Chromosomal integration of hyaluronic acid synthesis (has) genes enhances the molecular weight of hyaluronan produced in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Microbial production of hyaluronic acid (HA) is an attractive substitute for extraction of this biopolymer from animal tissues. Natural producers such as Streptococcus zooepidemicus are potential pathogens; therefore, production of HA by recombinant bacteria that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) organisms is a viable alternative that is being extensively explored. However, plasmid-based expression systems for HA production by recombinant bacteria have the inherent disadvantage of reduced productivity because of plasmid instability. To overcome this problem, the HA synthesis genes (hasA-hasB and hasA-hasB-hasC) from has-operon of S. zooepidemicus were integrated into the chromosome of Lactococcus lactis by site-directed, double-homologous recombination developing strains VRJ2AB and VRJ3ABC. The chromosomal integration stabilized the genes and obviated the instability observed in plasmid-expressed recombinant strains. The genome-integrated strains produced higher molecular weight (3.5-4 million Dalton [MDa]) HA compared to the plasmid-expressed strains (2 MDa). High molecular weight HA was produced when the intracellular concentration of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) was almost equal and hasA to hasB ratio was low. This work suggests an optimal approach to obtain high molecular weight HA in recombinant strains.
TI  - Effects of ingesting milk fermented by Lactococcus lactis H61 on skin health in young women: a randomized double-blind study.
AB  - We conducted a randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the effects of fermented milk produced using only Lactococcus lactis strain H61 as a starter bacterium (H61-fermented milk) on the general health and various skin properties of young women. Healthy female volunteers (n=23; age=19-21r) received H61-fermented milk (10(10) cfu of strain H61/d) or conventional yogurt (10(10) cfu of both Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per day), as a reference food, daily for 4 wk. Before and at the end of 4 wk, blood samples were taken, and skin hydration (inner forearms and cheek) and melanin content, elasticity, and sebum content (cheek only) were measured. Skin hydration at the inner forearm was higher at wk 4 than at wk 0 in both groups. Sebum content in cheek rose significantly after intervention in the H61-fermented milk group, but not the conventional yogurt group. Other skin parameters did not differ in either group. Serum analysis showed that total protein concentration and platelet count were elevated and reactive oxygen species decreased in both groups after the intervention. Although H61-fermented milk and conventional yogurt had similar effects on skin status and some blood characteristics of participants, an increase of sebum content in cheek is preferable to H61-fermented milk. As skin lipids contribute to maintaining the skin barrier, H61-fermented milk would provide beneficial effects on skin for young women.
TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1096 protein: gene cloning, protein expression, and  peptidoglycan deacetylase activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many bacteria modulate and evade the immune defenses of their hosts through peptidoglycan (PG) deacetylation. The PG deacetylases from Streptococcus pneumonia, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactococcus lactis have been characterized. However, thus far, the PG deacetylase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has not been identified. RESULTS: In this study, we cloned the Rv1096 gene from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain and expressed Rv1096 protein in both Escherichia coli and M. smegmatis. The results showed that the purified Rv1096 protein possessed metallo-dependent PG deacetylase activity, which increased in the presence of Co2+. The kinetic parameters of the PG deacetylase towards M. smegmatis PG as a substrate were as follows: Km, 0.910 +/- 0.007 mM; Vmax, 0.514 +/- 0.038 muMmin-1; and Kcat = 0.099 +/- 0.007 (S-1). Additionally, the viability of M. smegmatis in the presence of over-expressed Rv1096 protein was 109-fold higher than that of wild-type M. smegmatis after lysozyme treatment. Additionally, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that in the presence of over-expressed Rv1096 protein, M. smegmatis kept its regular shape, with an undamaged cell wall and smooth surface. These results indicate that Rv1096 caused deacetylation of cell wall PG, leading to lysozyme resistance in M. smegmatis. CONCLUSION: We have determined that M. tuberculosis Rv1096 is a PG deacetylase. The PG deacetylase activity of Rv1096 contributed to lysozyme resistance in M. smegmatis. Our findings suggest that deacetylation of cell wall PG may be involved in evasion of host immune defenses by M. tuberculosis.
TI  - Structure and activity of Streptococcus pyogenes SipA: a signal peptidase-like protein essential for pilus polymerisation.
AB  - The pili expressed on the surface of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes play an important role in host cell attachment, colonisation and pathogenesis. These pili are built from two or three components, an adhesin subunit at the tip, a major pilin that forms a polymeric shaft, and a basal pilin that is attached to the cell wall. Assembly is carried out by specific sortase (cysteine transpeptidase) enzyme. These components are encoded in a small gene cluster within the S. pyogenes genome, often together with another protein, SipA, whose function is unknown. We show through functional assays, carried out by expressing the S. pyogenes pilus components in Lactococcus lactis, SipA from the clinically important M1T1 strain is essential for pilus assembly, and that SipA function is likely to be conserved in all S. pyogenes. From the crystal structure of SipA we confirm that SipA belongs to the family of bacterial signal peptidases (SPases), which process the signal-peptides of secreted proteins. In contrast to a previous arm-swapped SipA dimer, this present structure shows that its principal domain closely resembles the catalytic domain of SPases and has a very similar peptide-binding cleft, but it lacks the catalytic Ser and Lys residues characteristic of SPases. In SipA these are replaced by Asp and Gly residues, which play no part in activity. We propose that SipA functions by binding a key component at the bacterial cell surface, in a conformation that facilitates pilus assembly.
TI  - Ratio of intracellular precursors concentration and their flux influences hyaluronic acid molecular weight in Streptococcus zooepidemicus and recombinant Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - HA molecular weight variation in Streptococcus zooepidemicus and two recombinant  Lactococcus lactis strains were investigated by chemostat experiments and metabolic flux analysis (MFA). The study showed that intracellular flux ratio of UDP-GlcUA to UDP-GlcNAc correlated directly with HA molecular weight, for all the three strains. The ratio of intracellular concentration of these HA precursors also exhibited a similar trend. Phosphoglucoisomerase activity and glucose flux towards lactic acid formation were found to be the major bottlenecks for HA production in all the three strains. The study suggests that environmental conditions and genetic manipulations that balance the intracellular flux and HA precursors concentrations will result in increased molecular weight.
TI  - Sil: a Streptococcus iniae bacteriocin with dual role as an antimicrobial and an  immunomodulator that inhibits innate immune response and promotes S. iniae infection.
AB  - Streptococcus iniae is a Gram-positive bacterium and a severe pathogen to a wide  range of economically important fish species. In addition, S. iniae is also a zoonotic pathogen and can cause serious infections in humans. In this study, we identified from a pathogenic S. iniae strain a putative bacteriocin, Sil, and examined its biological activity. Sil is composed of 101 amino acid residues and shares 35.6% overall sequence identity with the lactococcin 972 of Lactococcus lactis. Immunoblot analysis showed that Sil was secreted by S. iniae into the extracellular milieu. Purified recombinant Sil (rSil) exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth of Bacillus subtilis but had no impact on the growths of other 16 Gram-positive bacteria and 10 Gram-negative bacteria representing 23 different bacterial species. Treatment of rSil by heating at 50 degrees C abolished the activity of rSil. rSil bound to the surface of B. subtilis but induced no killing of the target cells. Cellular study revealed that rSil interacted with turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) head kidney monocytes and inhibited the innate immune response of the cells, which led to enhanced cellular infection of S. iniae. Antibody blocking of the extracellular Sil produced by S. iniae significantly attenuated the infectivity of S. iniae. Consistent with these in vitro observations, in vivo study showed that administration of turbot with rSil prior to S. iniae infection significantly increased bacterial dissemination and colonization in fish tissues. Taken together, these results indicate that Sil is a novel virulence-associated bacteriostatic and an immunoregulator that promotes S. iniae infection by impairing the immune defense of host fish.
TI  - Sensitivity to the two-peptide bacteriocin lactococcin G is dependent on UppP, an enzyme involved in cell-wall synthesis.
AB  - Most bacterially produced antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) are thought to kill target cells by a receptor-mediated mechanism. However, for most bacteriocins the receptor is unknown. For instance, no target receptor has been identified for the two-peptide bacteriocins (class IIb), whose activity requires the combined action of two individual peptides. To identify the receptor for the class IIb bacteriocin lactococcin G, which targets strains of Lactococcus lactis, we generated 12 lactococcin G-resistant mutants and performed whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations causing the resistant phenotype. Remarkably, all had a mutation in or near the gene uppP (bacA), encoding an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase; a membrane protein involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Nine mutants had stop codons or frameshifts in the uppP gene, two had point mutations in putative regulatory regions and one caused an amino acid substitution in UppP. To verify the receptor function of UppP, it was shown that growth of non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae could be inhibited by lactococcin G when L. lactis uppP was expressed in this bacterium. Furthermore, we show that the related class IIb bacteriocin enterocin 1071 also uses UppP as receptor. The approach used here should be broadly applicable to identify receptors for other bacteriocins as well.
TI  - SpyAD, a moonlighting protein of group A Streptococcus contributing to bacterial  division and host cell adhesion.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogen causing a wide repertoire of mild and severe diseases for which no vaccine is yet available. We recently reported the identification of three protein antigens that in combination conferred wide protection against GAS infection in mice. Here we focused our attention on the characterization of one of these three antigens, Spy0269, a highly conserved, surface-exposed, and immunogenic protein of unknown function. Deletion of the spy0269 gene in a GAS M1 isolate resulted in very long bacterial chains, which is indicative of an impaired capacity of the knockout mutant to properly divide. Confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the protein was mainly localized at the cell septum and could interact in vitro with the cell division protein FtsZ, leading us to hypothesize that Spy0269 is a member of the GAS divisome machinery. Predicted structural domains and sequence homologies with known streptococcal adhesins suggested that this antigen could also play a role in mediating GAS interaction with host cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by showing that recombinant Spy0269 could bind to mammalian epithelial cells in vitro and that Lactococcus lactis expressing Spy0269 on its cell surface could adhere to mammalian cells in vitro and to mice nasal mucosa in vivo. On the basis of these data, we believe that Spy0269 is involved both in bacterial cell division and in adhesion to host cells and we propose to rename this multifunctional moonlighting protein as SpyAD (Streptococcus pyogenes Adhesion and Division protein).
TI  - The elongation of ovococci.
AB  - The morphogenesis of ovococci has been reviewed extensively. Recent results have  provided new insights concerning the mechanisms of elongation in ovoid bacteria. We present here the proteins involved in the elongation (firmly established and more or less hypothetical) and discuss the relationship between elongation and division of ovococci.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the dairy isolate Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 against related members of the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the genus Streptococcus, only Streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. Streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. Members of the SBSEC have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. Here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 to the other SBSEC genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. RESULTS: Despite the fact that the SBSEC species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus infantarius CJ18 and Streptococcus pasteurianus ATCC 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. In addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of S. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. Analysis of the S. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy Lactococcus lactis and S. thermophilus as potential donors. In addition, S. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in S. gallolyticus. For example, S. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of S. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. Unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy S. infantarius CJ18, but also for the blood isolate S. pasteurianus ATCC 43144. CONCLUSIONS: Our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of S. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. During this process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. Finally, S. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative SBSEC virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.
TI  - Investigation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Bacillus licheniformis Strains Isolated from Retail Powdered Infant Milk Formulae.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of ten Bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail infant milk formulae against a range of indicator (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Listeria innocua) and clinically relevant (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli) microorganisms. Deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all B. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive target organisms. PCR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the B. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. The remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. Further analyses identified a peptide of ~1,422 Da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. N-terminal sequencing of the ~1,422 Da peptide from one strain identified it as ILPEITXIFHD. This peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by Bacillus spp. Subsequent PCR analyses demonstrated that the six B. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that the ~1,422 Da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.
TI  - Identification of a group B streptococcal fibronectin binding protein, SfbA, that contributes to invasion of brain endothelium and development of meningitis.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is currently the leading cause of neonatal meningitis. This is due to its ability to survive and multiply in the bloodstream and interact with specialized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC), which constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The exact mechanism(s) of GBS-BBB penetration is still largely unknown. We and others have shown that GBS interacts with components of the extracellular matrix. In this study, we demonstrate that GBS of representative serotypes binds immobilized and cell surface fibronectin and identify a putative fibronectin binding protein, streptococcal fibronectin binding protein A (SfbA). Allelic replacement of sfbA in the GBS chromosome resulted in a significant decrease in ability to bind fibronection and invade hBMEC compared with the wild-type (WT) parental strain. Expression of SfbA in the noninvasive strain Lactococcus lactis was sufficient to promote fibronectin binding and hBMEC invasion. Furthermore, the addition of an antifibronectin antibody or an RGD peptide that blocks fibronectin binding to integrins significantly reduced invasion of the WT but not the sfbA-deficient mutant strain, demonstrating the importance of an SfbA-fibronectin-integrin interaction for GBS cellular invasion. Using a murine model of GBS meningitis, we also observed that WT GBS penetrated the brain and established meningitis more frequently than did the DeltasfbA mutant strain. Our data suggest that GBS SfbA plays an important role in bacterial interaction with BBB endothelium and the pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis.
TI  - In vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese.
AB  - Twelve lactic acid bacteria (LAB), previously selected in vitro (Gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for the continuous four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Streptococcus thermophilus. LAB were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (WBM) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in WBM and raw milk. The strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a pH drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. After 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in pH values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris PON153, Ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides PON259 and PON559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees C. A sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (PDO) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. Thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). The dominance of lactococci over thermophilic LAB of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of VOC profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain Lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of Vastedda-like cheese.
TI  - beta-Phosphoglucomutase contributes to aciduricity in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans encounters an array of sugar moieties within the oral cavity due to a varied human diet. One such sugar is beta-d-glucose 1-phosphate (betaDG1P), which must be converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) before further metabolism to lactic acid. The conversion of betaDG1P to G6P is mediated by beta-phosphoglucomutase, which has not been previously observed in any oral streptococci, but has been extensively characterized and the gene designated pgmB in Lactococcus lactis. An orthologue was identified in S. mutans, SMU.1747c, and deletion of the gene resulted in the inability of the deletion strain to convert betaDG1P to G6P, indicating that SMU.1747c is a beta-phosphoglucomutase and should be designated pgmB. In this study, we sought to characterize how deletion of pgmB affected known virulence factors of S. mutans, specifically acid tolerance. The DeltapgmB strain showed a decreased ability to survive acid challenge. Additionally, the strain lacking beta-phosphoglucomutase had a diminished glycolytic profile compared with the parental strain. Deletion of pgmB had a negative impact on the virulence of S. mutans in the Galleria mellonella (greater wax worm) animal model. Our results indicate that pgmB plays a role at the juncture of carbohydrate metabolism and virulence.
TI  - Current taxonomy of phages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria have been the focus of significant research attention over the past three decades. Through the isolation and characterization of hundreds of phage isolates, it has been possible to classify phages of the dairy starter and adjunct bacteria Lactococus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Leuconostoc spp., and Lactobacillus spp. Among these, phages of L. lactis have been most thoroughly scrutinized and serve as an excellent model system to address issues that arise when attempting taxonomic classification of phages infecting other LAB species. Here, we present an overview of the current taxonomy of phages infecting LAB genera of industrial significance, the methods employed in these taxonomic efforts and how these may be employed for the taxonomy of phages of currently underrepresented and emerging phage species.
TI  - A widespread bacteriophage abortive infection system functions through a Type IV  toxin-antitoxin mechanism.
AB  - Bacterial abortive infection (Abi) systems are 'altruistic' cell death systems that are activated by phage infection and limit viral replication, thereby providing protection to the bacterial population. Here, we have used a novel approach of screening Abi systems as a tool to identify and characterize toxin-antitoxin (TA)-acting Abi systems. We show that AbiE systems are encoded by bicistronic operons and function via a non-interacting (Type IV) bacteriostatic TA mechanism. The abiE operon was negatively autoregulated by the antitoxin, AbiEi, a member of a widespread family of putative transcriptional regulators. AbiEi has an N-terminal winged-helix-turn-helix domain that is required for repression of abiE transcription, and an uncharacterized bi-functional C-terminal domain, which is necessary for transcriptional repression and sufficient for toxin neutralization. The cognate toxin, AbiEii, is a predicted nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) and member of the DNA polymerase beta family. AbiEii specifically bound GTP, and mutations in conserved NTase motifs (I-III) and a newly identified motif (IV), abolished GTP binding and subsequent toxicity. The AbiE systems can provide phage resistance and enable stabilization of mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids. Our study reveals molecular insights into the regulation and function of the widespread bi-functional AbiE Abi-TA systems and the biochemical properties of both toxin and antitoxin proteins.
TI  - Microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative Listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  - The study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of St-Nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. On the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named TR15 (Truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: TR15-SC (58 isolates from TR15 collection), TR15-M (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and TR15-BHI (pools of isolates from BHI medium). Their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk were compared with the activity of complex consortium TR15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii). The natural consortium TR15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium TR15-BHI. The dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16S rDNA sequencing and direct 16S rDNA Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis. The combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium TR15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. Cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such as Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Vagococcus fluvialis, Enterococcus gilvus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as Arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas psychrophila and Enterobacter spp.). The highest L. monocytogenes count was on rind with TR15-M and was positively associated with the highest pH value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and Gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by Staphylococcus vitulinus, Brevibacterium linens, Microbacterium gubbeenense and Brachybacterium tyrofermentans. The results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. It is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - BsaB, a novel adherence factor of group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, peripartum infections in women, and invasive infections in chronically ill or elderly individuals. GBS can be isolated from the gastrointestinal or genital tracts of up to 30% of healthy adults, and infection is thought to arise from invasion from a colonized mucosal site. Accordingly, bacterial surface components that mediate attachment of GBS to host cells or the extracellular matrix represent key factors in the colonization and infection of the human host. We identified a conserved GBS gene of unknown function that was predicted to encode a cell wall-anchored surface protein. Deletion of the gene and a cotranscribed upstream open reading frame (ORF) in GBS strain 515 reduced bacterial adherence to VK2 vaginal epithelial cells in vitro and reduced GBS binding to fibronectin-coated microtiter wells. Expression of the gene product in Lactococcus lactis conferred the ability to adhere to VK2 cells, to fibronectin and laminin, and to fibronectin-coated ME-180 cervical epithelial cells. Expression of the recombinant protein in L. lactis also markedly increased biofilm formation. The adherence function of the protein, named bacterial surface adhesin of GBS (BsaB), depended both on a central BID1 domain found in bacterial intimin-like proteins and on the C-terminal portion of the BsaB protein. Expression of BsaB in GBS, like that of several other adhesins, was regulated by the CsrRS two-component system. We conclude that BsaB represents a newly identified adhesin that participates in GBS attachment to epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix.
TI  - Food environments select microorganisms based on selfish energetic behavior.
AB  - Nutrient richness, and specifically the abundance of mono- and disaccharides that characterize several food matrixes, such as milk and grape juice, has allowed the speciation of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts with a high fermentation capacity instead of energetically favorable respiratory metabolism. In these environmental contexts, rapid sugar consumption and lactic acid or ethanol production, accumulation, and tolerance, together with the ability to propagate in the absence of oxygen, are several of the "winning" traits that have apparently evolved and become specialized to perfection in these fermenting microorganisms. Here, we summarize and discuss the evolutionary context that has driven energetic metabolism in food-associated microorganisms, using the dairy species Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus among prokaryotes and the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae among eukaryotes as model organisms.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Restoration of bioactive lantibiotic suicin from a remnant lan locus of pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides. Their biosynthesis genes are usually organized in gene clusters, which are mainly found in Gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic streptococci. Three highly virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains (98HAH33, 05ZYH33, and SC84) have been shown to contain an 89K pathogenicity island. Here, on these islands, we unveiled and reannotated a putative lantibiotic locus designated sui which contains a virulence-associated two-component regulator, suiK-suiR. In silico analysis revealed that the putative lantibiotic modification gene suiM was interrupted by a 7.9-kb integron and that other biosynthesis-related genes contained various frameshift mutations. By reconstituting the intact suiM in Escherichia coli together with a semi-in vitro biosynthesis system, a putative lantibiotic named suicin was produced with bactericidal activities against a variety of Gram-positive strains, including pathogenic streptococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Ring topology dissection indicated that the 34-amino-acid lantibiotic contained two methyllanthionine residues and one disulfide bridge, which render suicin in an N-terminal linear and C-terminal globular shape. To confirm the function of suiK-suiR, SuiR was overexpressed and purified. In vitro analysis showed that SuiR could specifically bind to the suiA gene promoter. Its coexpression with suiK could activate suiA gene promoter in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. Conclusively, we obtained a novel lantibiotic suicin by restoring its production from the remnant sui locus and demonstrated that virulence-associated SuiK-SuiR regulates its production.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation of a traditional Chinese fish product, Chouguiyu (stinky mandarinfish).
AB  - Chouguiyu, or stinky mandarinfish, is a traditional Chinese fermented fish product made of mandarinfish by spontaneous fermentation at the anaerobic condition with low-salt concentration. In order to get a primary understanding of the microbial community presenting in the Chouguiyu fermentation, 61 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various fermentation period were isolated using MRS agar plates and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and 16S rRNA partial gene sequencing analysis. Eight distinct bacterial species belonging to 6 genera were identified in total. Among them, Lactobacillus sakei was the dominant species (63%) during the fermentation, which exhibited great variety in phenotypic tests but unique genotypic characters. Meanwhile, the other LAB species including Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae, Lc. lactis, Lc. raffinolactis, Vagococcus sp., Enterococcus hermanniensis, Macrococcus caseolyticus as well as Streptococcus parauberis were also recovered from the different fermentation periods, especially at the initial point of the fermentation. This seems to be the 1st report investigating the LAB composition involved in Chouguiyu fermentation and the data obtained in this study may be valuable for selecting starter culture for Chouguiyu industrial-scale production.
TI  - Intensive mutagenesis of the nisin hinge leads to the rational design of enhanced derivatives.
AB  - Nisin A is the most extensively studied lantibiotic and has been used as a preservative by the food industry since 1953. This 34 amino acid peptide contains three dehydrated amino acids and five thioether rings. These rings, resulting from one lanthionine and four methyllanthionine bridges, confer the peptide with its unique structure. Nisin A has two mechanisms of action, with the N-terminal domain of the peptide inhibiting cell wall synthesis through lipid II binding and the C-terminal domain responsible for pore-formation. The focus of this study is the three amino acid 'hinge' region (N 20, M 21 and K 22) which separates these two domains and allows for conformational flexibility. As all lantibiotics are gene encoded, novel variants can be generated through manipulation of the corresponding gene. A number of derivatives in which the hinge region was altered have previously been shown to possess enhanced antimicrobial activity. Here we take this approach further by employing simultaneous, indiscriminate site-saturation mutagenesis of all three hinge residues to create a novel bank of nisin derivative producers. Screening of this bank revealed that producers of peptides with hinge regions consisting of AAK, NAI and SLS displayed enhanced bioactivity against a variety of targets. These and other results suggested a preference for small, chiral amino acids within the hinge region, leading to the design and creation of producers of peptides with hinges consisting of AAA and SAA. These producers, and the corresponding peptides, exhibited enhanced bioactivity against Lactococcus lactis HP, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2155 and Staphylococcus aureus RF122 and thus represent the first example of nisin derivatives that possess enhanced activity as a consequence of rational design.
TI  - Evaporation induced self assembled microstructures of silica nanoparticles and Streptococcus lactis cells as sorbent for uranium (VI).
AB  - An assembled microstructure of silica nanoparticles and Streptococcus lactis (S.  lactis) cells has been synthesized by evaporation induced self assembly, with the objective of its application in bioremediation. Different morphologies have been realized by tuning the physico-chemical conditions of the assembly process. The potential of these microstructures in removal of uranium (VI) has been evaluated. Morphology dependent uptake has been demonstrated and maximum uptake was seen for the spray dried doughnut shaped microstructure (SDSM). For a fixed morphology, the variation in uptake varies with solution pH, contact time, temperature and initial uranium (VI) concentration. The U (VI) removal was significantly rapid, with more than 85 +/- 2% of total uptake in 10 min. The maximum sorption capacity (qmax) of U (VI) at pH 5.0 and temperature 298 K was 169.5 mg/g using SDSM as sorbent. The kinetic data of adsorption of U (VI) are best described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Calculated thermodynamic parameters reveal an endothermic and a spontaneous adsorption process. The present work opens up the possibility of a means for the functionalization of silica microstructures through the incorporation of micro-organism and the potential for the use of these functionalized materials for bioremediation.
TI  - Genetic engineering techniques for lactic acid bacteria: construction of a stable shuttle vector and expression vector for beta-glucuronidase.
AB  - The shuttle vector, pUL6erm, was constructed by using a replicon from pL2, a multiple cloning site, colE1 ori, the ori of Gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the erythromycin resistance gene from pVA838 as a selection marker. pUL6erm could be transformed easily and maintained stably in Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei. Transformation assays of pUL6erm indicated that it had a narrow host range. beta-Glucuronidase was induced in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl and 50 mM glutamate and expressed at 2.4 U mg(-1) with the expression vector (pUL6erm-gadR-GUS) constructed based on pUL6erm carrying beta-glucuronidase gene wuth a chloride-inducible (gadR) expression cassette using Pgad as promoter. Therefore, pUL6erm and pUL6erm-gadR-GUS might be a safe and useful genetic tool for the improvement of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of nisin against the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis and its synergistic interaction with antibiotics.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs, including meningitis, endocarditis and pneumonia. Furthermore, this bacterium is considered an emerging zoonotic agent. Recently, increased antibiotic resistance in S. suis has been reported worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of nisin, a bacteriocin of the lantibiotic class, as an antibacterial agent against the pathogen S. suis serotype 2. In addition, the synergistic activity of nisin in combination with conventional antibiotics was assessed. Using a plate assay, the nisin-producing strain Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454 proved to be capable of inhibiting the growth of S. suis (n=18) belonging to either sequence type (ST)1, ST25, or ST28. In a microdilution broth assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of purified nisin ranged between 1.25 and 5 mug/mL while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was between 5 and 10 mug/mL toward S. suis. The use of a capsule-deficient mutant of S. suis indicated that the presence of this polysaccharidic structure has no marked impact on susceptibility to nisin. Following treatment of S. suis with nisin, transmission electron microscopy observations revealed lysis of bacteria resulting from breakdown of the cell membrane. A time-killing curve showed a rapid bactericidal activity of nisin. Lastly, synergistic effects of nisin were observed in combination with several antibiotics, including penicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin and ceftiofur. This study brought clear evidence supporting the potential of nisin for the prevention and treatment of S. suis infections in pigs.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis BFE920 activates the innate immune system of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), resulting in protection against Streptococcus iniae infection and enhancing feed efficiency and weight gain in large-scale field studies.
AB  - The protective effect of a food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis BFE920 against disease of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) cultivated on a large scale was studied. Initially, antimicrobial activity of L. lactis against several fish pathogens was evaluated in vitro; the probiotic showed strong antibacterial activity against Streptococcus iniae, Streptococcus parauberis and Enterococcus viikkiensis, and moderate activity against Lactococcus garviae. When olive flounders were fed for two weeks with experimental diets containing varying concentrations of L. lactis (1 x 10(6), 5 x 10(6), 2.5 x 10(7) and 1.25 x 10(8) CFU/g feed), all the experimental feed groups showed 68-77% survival upon challenge with S. iniae. A field-scale feeding trial with L. lactis dietary supplement was conducted in a local fish farm (n = 12,000) for three months, and disease resistance, innate immune parameters and growth performance were evaluated. The average weight gain and feed efficiency were increased up to 6.8% and 8.5%, respectively. At the end of the feeding trial, the olive flounders were challenged with S. iniae. The L. lactis-fed group was protected from S. iniae challenge with a 66% survival rate. This disease protection is due to the flounder's innate immunity activated by the L. lactis administration: increased lysosomal activities and production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. These data clearly indicated that L. lactis BFE920 may be developed as a functional feed additive for protection against diseases, and for enhancement of feed efficiency and weight gain in olive flounder farming.
TI  - Characterization of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum LMA 28 for its positive technological role in soft cheese making.
AB  - Carnobacterium maltaromaticum is a lactic acid bacterium isolated from soft cheese. The objective of this work was to study its potential positive impact when used in cheese technology. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of six strains of C. maltaromaticum showed that they belong to different phylogenetic groups. Although these strains lacked the ability to coagulate milk quickly, they were acidotolerant. They did not affect the coagulation capacity of starter lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, used in dairy industry. The impact of C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 on bacterial flora of cheese revealed a significant decrease of Psychrobacter sp. concentration, which might be responsible for cheese aging phenomena. An experimental plan was carried out to unravel the mechanism of inhibition of Psychrobacter sp. and Listeria monocytogenes and possible interaction between various factors (cell concentration, NaCl, pH and incubation time). Cellular concentration of C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 was found to be the main factor involved in the inhibition of Psychrobacter sp. and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Functional diversity of tandem substrate-binding domains in ABC transporters from pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter GlnPQ is an essential uptake system for amino acids in gram-positive pathogens and related nonpathogenic bacteria. The transporter has tandem substrate-binding domains (SBDs) fused to each transmembrane domain, giving rise to four SBDs per functional transporter complex. We have determined the crystal structures and ligand-binding properties of the SBDs of GlnPQ from Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Lactococcus lactis. The tandem SBDs differ in substrate specificity and affinity, allowing cells to efficiently accumulate different amino acids via a single ABC transporter. The combined structural, functional, and thermodynamic analysis revealed the roles of individual residues in determining the substrate affinity. We succeeded in converting a low-affinity SBD into a high-affinity receptor and vice versa. Our data indicate that a small number of residues that reside in the binding pocket constitute the major affinity determinants of the SBDs.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of Serbia and lowland regions of Croatia.
AB  - The goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (BG) and nine fresh soft (ZG) artisanal cheeses collected in Serbia and Croatia. While LAB were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all BG cheeses but only in three ZG cheese samples. High LAB and yeast species diversity was determined (average H'(L)=0.4 and H'(Y)=0.8, respectively). The predominant LAB species in white pickled (BG) cheeses were Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (ZG) cheeses the most dominant LAB species were L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. Among the 20 yeast species found, Debaryomyces hansenii, Candida zeylanoides, and Torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in BG cheeses, while Yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in ZG cheeses. The characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of LAB isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of LAB strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic or proteolytic activity. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of LAB and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. The knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific LAB and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.
TI  - Benchmarking various green fluorescent protein variants in Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Lactococcus lactis for live cell imaging.
AB  - Green fluorescent protein (GFP) offers efficient ways of visualizing promoter activity and protein localization in vivo, and many different variants are currently available to study bacterial cell biology. Which of these variants is best suited for a certain bacterial strain, goal, or experimental condition is not clear. Here, we have designed and constructed two "superfolder" GFPs with codon adaptation specifically for Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae and have benchmarked them against five other previously available variants of GFP in B. subtilis, S. pneumoniae, and Lactococcus lactis, using promoter-gfp fusions. Surprisingly, the best-performing GFP under our experimental conditions in B. subtilis was the one codon optimized for S. pneumoniae and vice versa. The data and tools described in this study will be useful for cell biology studies in low-GC-rich Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Pyruvate kinase (PYK) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. Lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of PYK in their metabolism. These organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. They include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of PYK by inorganic phosphate, the activation of PYK shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. System-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. These require knowledge of the identities of the enzyme modifiers. Here, we predict potential allosteric activators of PYKs from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. We used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of PYK. Specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. We then made a kinetic model of Lactococcus lactis PYK to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. This strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the Enterococcus faecalis PYK, and to predict that the PYKs from Streptococcus pyogenes and Lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. These differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. The combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.
TI  - NSR from Streptococcus agalactiae confers resistance against nisin and is encoded by a conserved nsr operon.
AB  - Nisin is a lantibiotic produced by Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), which is active against many Gram-positive bacteria. However, in various pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, the presence of a nisin resistance protein (NSR) confers resistance against nisin. Here, we show that NSR from Streptococcus agalactiae (SaNSR) confers 20-fold resistance when expressed in L. lactis. We also show that SaNSR is encoded by an operon structure comprising of a lipoprotein and an ATP-binding cassette transporter as well as a two-component system that is putatively involved in expression and regulation. This organization of the operon is conserved in several (non)pathogenic strains that do not produce nisin themselves.
TI  - Kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from Streptococcus pyogenes M49.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. S. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ADS) for survival in acidic environments. In this study, the arginine deiminase (AD), and carbamate kinase (CK) from S. pyogenes M49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. AD and CK from S. pyogenes M49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and Enterococcus faecalis V583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). We found that the arginine deiminase of S. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., ATP, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). The Km and Vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mM (mean+/-SD) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. The carbamate kinase is inhibited by ATP but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. The Km and Vmax values for ADP were 0.72+/-0.08mM and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the Km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mM. The optimum pH and temperature for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively.
TI  - Nuclease A (Gbs0661), an extracellular nuclease of Streptococcus agalactiae, attacks the neutrophil extracellular traps and is needed for full virulence.
AB  - Most bacteria of the genus Streptococcus are opportunistic pathogens, and some of them produce extracellular DNases, which may be important for virulence. Genome analyses of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) neonate isolate NEM316 revealed the presence of seven genes putatively encoding secreted DNases, although their functions, if any, are unknown. In this study, we observed that respiration growth of GBS led to the extracellular accumulation of a putative nuclease, identified as being encoded by the gbs0661 gene. When overproduced in Lactococcus lactis, the protein was found to be a divalent cation-requiring, pH-stable and heat-stable nuclease that we named Nuclease A (NucA). Substitution of the histidine(148) by alanine reduced nuclease activity of the GBS wild-type strain, indicating that NucA is the major nuclease ex vivo. We determined that GBS is able to degrade the DNA matrix comprising the neutrophil extracellular trap (NET). The nucA(H148A) mutant was impaired for this function, implicating NucA in the virulence of GBS. In vivo infection studies confirmed that NucA is required for full infection, as the mutant strain allowed increased bacterial clearance from lung tissue and decreased mortality in infected mice. These results show that NucA is involved in NET escape and is needed for full virulence.
TI  - Diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing.
AB  - Thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. To assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees C for 30 min (PM samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees C for 24 h (IPM samples). The microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees C) and culture-independent (PCR-DGGE and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons) microbial techniques. The results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (RM samples). Twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by molecular methods. Mesophilic LAB species (Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the RM samples. However, S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both PM and IPM samples. The DGGE profiles of RM and PM samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus species. In contrast, just three DGGE bands were obtained for IPM samples, two of which were assigned to S. thermophilus. The pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 3% sequence divergence in an RM sample, while only 13 were encountered in two IPM samples. This technique identified Leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the RM sample, while S. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the IPM samples. The procedure followed in this study allowed to estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic LAB strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.
TI  - Regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) display differences in their regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. We combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), phosphate (Pi), and ionic strength (NaCl concentration) on six LDHs from four LABs studied at pH 6 and pH 7. We found that 1) the extent of activation by FBP (Kact) differs. Lactobacillus plantarum LDH is not regulated by FBP, but the other LDHs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: Enterococcus faecalis LDH2 </= Lactococcus lactis LDH2 < E. faecalis LDH1 < L. lactis LDH1 </= Streptococcus pyogenes LDH. This trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the LDH enzymes. 2) For L. plantarum, S. pyogenes, and E. faecalis, the effects of Pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding NaCl. 3) Addition of Pi inhibits E. faecalis LDH2, whereas in the absence of FBP, Pi is an activator of S. pyogenes LDH, E. faecalis LDH1, and L. lactis LDH1 and LDH2 at pH 6. These effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of Pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to pH 6 and pH 7. Overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of Pi, FBP, and pH that results in different regulatory effects on the LDHs of different LABs.
TI  - The AgI/II family adhesin AspA is required for respiratory infection by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is a human pathogen that causes pharyngitis and invasive diseases such as toxic shock syndrome and sepsis. The upper respiratory tract is the primary reservoir from which GAS can infect new hosts and cause disease. The factors involved in colonisation are incompletely known however. Previous evidence in oral streptococci has shown that the AgI/II family proteins are involved. We hypothesized that the AspA member of this family might be involved in GAS colonization. We describe a novel mouse model of GAS colonization of the nasopharynx and lower respiratory tract to elucidate these interactions. We used two clinical M serotypes expressing AspA, and their aspA gene deletant isogenic mutants in experiments using adherence assays to respiratory epithelium, macrophage phagocytosis and neutrophil killing assays and in vivo models of respiratory tract colonisation and infection. We demonstrated the requirement for AspA in colonization of the respiratory tract. AspA mutants were cleared from the respiratory tract and were deficient in adherence to epithelial cells, and susceptible to phagocytosis. Expression of AspA in the surrogate host Lactococcus lactis protected bacteria from phagocytosis. Our results suggest that AspA has an essential role in respiratory infection, and may function as a novel anti-phagocytic factor.
TI  - [The effect of kefir consumption on human immune system: a cytokine study].
AB  - The systemic effects of bioactive peptides which are produced by the fermentation of milk via the microorganisms found in kefir have been the subject of interest in recent years. Bioactive peptides activate innate immunity by stimulating macrophages, increasing phagocytosis, augmenting NO and cytokine production and boosting the lumen levels of IgG and IgA+ B-lymphocytes. The aim of the present study was to determine the serum cytokine profiles of healthy volunteers after kefir consumption to evaluate helper T (TH) cell polarization and to bring out the effects on native and allergic immune responses. The study was designed as a prospective and self-controlled study. A total of 18 healthy volunteers (age range: 20-40 yrs, mean age: 35.5 +/- 7.38 yrs) from a university hospital staff were recruited to the study, with the approval of ethical board and informed consent. The body mass indices of all participants were between normal range (20.10-25.70 kg/m2). After two weeks of a diet free from fermented products, the participants consumed 200 mL kefir daily, for six weeks. Kefir product was prepared by using kefir starter culture (Danisco Biolacta Sp - 05223B 10001, Poland) which contains Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and Streptococcus termophilus, an overnight incubation at 26 degrees C, and consumed freshly. Fasting blood samples of subjects were collected just before kefir use (0th week), at the end of the 3rd and 6th weeks of kefir consumption, and three weeks after cessation of kefir usage (9th week). Serum TNF-a, IL-1, IL-5, IL-8 and TGF-beta levels were measured by using commercial ELISA kits (BioSource, Belgium and Invitrogen, USA). Hemoglobin, serum creatinine and ALT levels of all subjects were also determined for follow-up. All volunteers completed the study period without any problem and declared no complaint. Hemoglobin, creatinine and ALT levels did not change with kefir consumption. Serum IL-8 levels were decreased at 3rd and 6th weeks (p< 0.001) and were at low levels at 9th week (p= 0.005) when compared with baseline levels (0th week). Serum IL-5 levels were increased at 3rd week (0th-3rd weeks; p= 0.01) and decreased by a rebound effect at 9th week (6th-9th week p= 0.003). TNF-alpha levels were increased with kefir consumption (p= 0.046) but the increase was insignificant in paired comparisons and the level was borderline between 0th and 6th weeks (p= 0.013). IL-5 and TNF-alpha levels returned to their original levels (0th week) at 9th week. Levels of the other cytokines (IL-1 and TGF-beta) did not change significantly with kefir usage. These results indicated that kefir use increased polarization of the immune response towards TH1 type and decreased TH2 type response and accordingly allergic response. The decrease in IL-8 level due to kefir use, might control the inflammatory response by suppressing neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. On the other hand it was also concluded that increased IL-5 might stimulate secretory IgA at gastrointestinal mucosa leading to a more efficient immune response in the intestinal lumen.
TI  - Consumption of fermented milk product with probiotic modulates brain activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Changes in gut microbiota have been reported to alter signaling mechanisms, emotional behavior, and visceral nociceptive reflexes in rodents. However, alteration of the intestinal microbiota with antibiotics or probiotics has not been shown to produce these changes in humans. We investigated whether consumption of a fermented milk product with probiotic (FMPP) for 4 weeks by healthy women altered brain intrinsic connectivity or responses to emotional attention tasks. METHODS: Healthy women with no gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms were randomly assigned to groups given FMPP (n = 12), a nonfermented milk product (n = 11, controls), or no intervention (n = 13) twice daily for 4 weeks. The FMPP contained Bifidobacterium animalis subsp Lactis, Streptococcus thermophiles, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp Lactis. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after the intervention to measure brain response to an emotional faces attention task and resting brain activity. Multivariate and region of interest analyses were performed. RESULTS: FMPP intake was associated with reduced task-related response of a distributed functional network (49% cross-block covariance; P = .004) containing affective, viscerosensory, and somatosensory cortices. Alterations in intrinsic activity of resting brain indicated that ingestion of FMPP was associated with changes in midbrain connectivity, which could explain the observed differences in activity during the task. CONCLUSIONS: Four-week intake of an FMPP by healthy women affected activity of brain regions that control central processing of emotion and sensation.
TI  - Activated human nasal epithelial cells modulate specific antibody response against bacterial or viral antigens.
AB  - Nasal mucosa is an immune responsive organ evidenced by eliciting both specific local secretory IgA and systemic IgG antibody responses with intra-nasal administration of antigens. Nevertheless, the role of nasal epithelial cells in modulating such responses is unclear. Human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) obtained from sinus mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were cultured in vitro and firstly were stimulated by Lactococcus lactis bacterium-like particles (BLPs) in order to examine their role on antibody production. Secondly, both antigens of immunodominant protein IDG60 from oral Streptococcus mutans and hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza virus were tested to evaluate the specific antibody response. Stimulated hNECs by BLPs exhibited a significant increase in the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Conditioned medium of stimulated hNECs has effects on enhancing the proliferation of CD4+ T cells together with interferon-gamma and IL-5 production, increasing the costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells and augmenting the production of IDG60 specific IgA, HA specific IgG, IgA by human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Such production of antigen specific IgG and IgA is significantly counteracted in the presence of IL-6 and TSLP neutralizing antibodies. In conclusion, properly stimulated hNECs may impart immuno-modulatory effects on the antigen-specific antibody response at least through the production of IL-6 and TSLP.
TI  - Changes in fatty acid profile of feta cheese including conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the last two decades much attention has been given to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) because of its potentially beneficial biological effects. Cheese is one of the major dietary sources of CLA. However, the CLA content of Greek cheeses is variable and affected by many factors. Fatty acid analysis of feta cheese, made of sheep's milk, was conducted at different stages of the manufacturing process in order to monitor and explain fatty acid and especially CLA changes. RESULTS: CLA content in fresh milk and during the early stages of manufacture was 0.66 +/- 0.02 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids; it increased during the ripening process (0.75 +/- 0.06 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids) and decreased during storage (0.52 +/- 0.15 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids). Saturated fatty acids (SFA), increased after 37 and 48 days of aging, while monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), showed the opposite tendency. CONCLUSION: CLA content significantly increased during the ripening stages and decreased during aging (P </= 0.05). CLA is not stable during manufacture and storage of feta cheese, a fact which should be resolved, since this biologically active substance can be obtained from the diet.
TI  - Bacteriophages in food fermentations: new frontiers in a continuous arms race.
AB  - Phage contamination represents an important risk to any process requiring bacterial growth, particularly in the biotechnology and food industries. The presence of unwanted phages may lead to manufacturing delays, lower quality product, or, in the worst cases, total production loss. Thus, constant phage monitoring and stringent application of the appropriate control measures are indispensable. In fact, a systematic preventive approach to phage contamination [phage analysis and critical control points (PACCP)] should be put in place. In this review, sources of phage contamination and novel phage detection methods are described, with an emphasis on bacterial viruses that infect lactic acid bacteria used in food fermentations. Recent discoveries related to antiphage systems that are changing our views on phage-host interactions are highlighted. Finally, future directions are also discussed.
TI  - Isolation and identification of the microbiota of Danish farmhouse and industrially produced surface-ripened cheeses.
AB  - For studying the microbiota of four Danish surface-ripened cheeses produced at three farmhouses and one industrial dairy, both a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach were used. After dereplication of the initial set of 433 isolates by (GTG)5-PCR fingerprinting, 217 bacterial and 25 yeast isolates were identified by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene or the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene, respectively. At the end of ripening, the cheese core microbiota of the farmhouse cheeses consisted of the mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteorides as well as non-starter LAB including different Lactobacillus spp. The cheese from the industrial dairy was almost exclusively dominated by Lb. paracasei. The surface bacterial microbiota of all four cheeses were dominated by Corynebacterium spp. and/or Brachybacterium spp. Brevibacterium spp. was found to be subdominant compared to other bacteria on the farmhouse cheeses, and no Brevibacterium spp. was found on the cheese from the industrial dairy, even though B. linens was used as surface-ripening culture. Moreover, Gram-negative bacteria identified as Alcalignes faecalis and Proteus vulgaris were found on one of the farmhouse cheeses. The surface yeast microbiota consisted primarily of one dominating species for each cheese. For the farmhouse cheeses, the dominant yeast species were Yarrowia lipolytica, Geotrichum spp. and Debaryomyces hansenii, respectively, and for the cheese from the industrial dairy, D. hansenii was the dominant yeast species. Additionally, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed that Streptococcus thermophilus was present in the farmhouse raw milk cheese analysed in this study. Furthermore, DGGE bands corresponding to Vagococcus carniphilus, Psychrobacter spp. and Lb. curvatus on the cheese surfaces indicated that these bacterial species may play a role in cheese ripening.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Structural aspects of the interaction of dairy phages with their host bacteria.
AB  - Knowledge of phage-host interactions at a fundamental level is central to the design of rational strategies for the development of phage-resistant strains that may be applied in industrial settings. Phages infecting lactic acid bacteria, in particular Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, negatively impact on dairy fermentation processes with serious economic implications. In recent years a wealth of information on structural protein assembly and topology has become available relating to phages infecting Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis, which act as models for structural analyses of dairy phages. In this review, we explore the role of model tailed phages, such as T4 and SPP1, in advancing our knowledge regarding interactions between dairy phages and their hosts. Furthermore, the potential of currently investigated dairy phages to in turn serve as model systems for this particular group of phages is discussed.
TI  - Characterization of a new CAMP factor carried by an integrative and conjugative element in Streptococcus agalactiae and spreading in Streptococci.
AB  - Genetic exchanges between Streptococci occur frequently and contribute to their genome diversification. Most of sequenced streptococcal genomes carry multiple mobile genetic elements including Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) that play a major role in these horizontal gene transfers. In addition to genes involved in their mobility and regulation, ICEs also carry genes that can confer selective advantages to bacteria. Numerous elements have been described in S. agalactiae especially those integrated at the 3' end of a tRNA(Lys) encoding gene. In strain 515 of S. agalactiae, an invasive neonate human pathogen, the ICE (called 515_tRNA(Lys)) is functional and carries different putative virulence genes including one encoding a putative new CAMP factor in addition to the one previously described. This work demonstrated the functionality of this CAMP factor (CAMP factor II) in Lactococcus lactis but also in pathogenic strains of veterinary origin. The search for co-hemolytic factors in a collection of field strains revealed their presence in S. uberis, S. dysgalactiae, but also for the first time in S. equisimilis and S. bovis. Sequencing of these genes revealed the prevalence of a species-specific factor in S. uberis strains (Uberis factor) and the presence of a CAMP factor II encoding gene in S. bovis and S. equisimilis. Furthermore, most of the CAMP factor II positive strains also carried an element integrated in the tRNA(Lys) gene. This work thus describes a CAMP factor that is carried by a mobile genetic element and has spread to different streptococcal species.
TI  - The dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of Obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - Obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from Uganda namely: Obutoko, Enturire, Ekitiribita and Obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. Knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. Culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and mixed DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified ribosomal RNA genes were used to study the bacteria and yeast diversity of Obushera. The pH dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire whereas that of Ekitiribita decreased to 4.4 after 4 days. Counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. LAB and yeast isolates were identified by rRNA gene sequence analysis. LAB isolates included: Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus (S.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weisella (W.) confusa. DGGE indicated predominance of S. gallolyticus, S. infantarius subsp. infantarius, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, W. confusa, Lb. reuteri, Fructobacillus spp., L. lactis and L. lactis. Yeast isolates included Clavispora lusitaniae, Cyberlindnera fabianii, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DGGE indicated predominance of S. cerevisiae in Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and also detected Pichia spp. and I. orientalis in Obutoko. Obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and later by Lactococcus spp. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp. were also detected in Ekitiribita. Development of starters for Obushera may require combinations of LAB and S. cerevisiae for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and LAB for Ekitiribita.
TI  - Analysis of microbial diversity on deli slicers using polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technologies.
AB  - Cross-contamination of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria from food-contact surfaces to food products is a serious public health issue. Bacteria may survive and attach to food-contact surfaces by residual food components and/or background bacteria which may subsequently transfer to other food products. Deli slicers, generally used for slicing ready-to-eat products, can serve as potential sources for considerable bacterial transfer. The objective of this study was to assess the extent and distribution of microbial diversity of deli slicers by identification of pathogenic and background bacteria. Slicer-swab samples were collected from restaurants in Arkansas and Texas in the United States. Ten surface areas for each slicer were swabbed using sterile sponges. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was applied to investigate the fingerprint of samples, and each band was further identified by sequence analysis. Pseudomonads were identified as the dominant bacteria followed by Enterobacteriaceae family, and lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were also found. Bacterial distribution was similar for all surface areas, while the blade guard exhibited the greatest diversity. This study provides a profile of the microbial ecology of slicers using DGGE to develop more specific sanitation practices and to reduce cross-contamination during slicing.
TI  - Influence of in ovo prebiotic and synbiotic administration on meat quality of broiler chickens.
AB  - A trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of in ovo injection of prebiotic and synbiotics on growth performance, meat quality traits (cholesterol content, intramuscular collagen properties, fiber measurements), and the presence of histopathological changes in the pectoral muscle (PS) of broiler chickens. On d 12 of incubation, 480 eggs were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups treated with different bioactives, in ovo injected: C, control with physiological saline; T1 with 1.9 mg of raffinose family oligosaccharides; T2 and T3 with 1.9 mg of raffinose family oligosaccharides enriched with different probiotic bacteria, specifically 1,000 cfu of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis SL1 and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris IBB SC1, respectively; T4 with commercially available synbiotic Duolac, containing 500 cfu of both Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium with the addition of lactose (0.001 mg/embryo). Among the hatched chickens, 60 males were randomly chosen (12 birds for each group) and were grown to 42 d in collective cages (n = 3 birds in each 4 cages: replications for experimental groups). Broilers were fed ad libitum commercial diets according to age. In ovo prebiotic and synbiotic administration had a low effect on investigated traits, but depend on the kind of bioactives administered. Commercial synbiotic treatment (T4) reduced carcass yield percentage, and the feed conversion ratio was higher in T3 and T4 groups compared with other groups. The abdominal fat, the ultimate pH, and cholesterol of the PS were not affected by treatment. Broiler chickens of the treated groups with both slightly greater PS and fiber diameter had a significantly lower amount of collagen. The greater thickness of muscle fibers (not significant) and the lower fiber density (statistically significant), observed in treated birds in comparison with those of the C group, are not associated with histopathological changes in the PS of broilers. The incidence of histopathological changes in broiler chickens from examined groups was low, which did not affect the deterioration of meat quality obtained from these birds.
TI  - Phages of lactic acid bacteria: the role of genetics in understanding phage-host  interactions and their co-evolutionary processes.
AB  - Dairy fermentations are among the oldest food processing applications, aimed at preservation and shelf-life extension through the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures, in particular strains of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus spp. and Leuconostoc spp. Traditionally this was performed by continuous passaging of undefined cultures from a finished fermentation to initiate the next fermentation. More recently, consumer demands on consistent and desired flavours and textures of dairy products have led to a more defined approach to such processes. Dairy (starter) companies have responded to the need to define the nature and complexity of the starter culture mixes, and dairy fermentations are now frequently based on defined starter cultures of low complexity, where each starter component imparts specific technological properties that are desirable to the product. Both mixed and defined starter culture approaches create the perfect environment for the proliferation of (bacterio)phages capable of infecting these LAB. The repeated use of the same starter cultures in a single plant, coupled to the drive towards higher and consistent production levels, increases the risk and negative impact of phage infection. In this review we will discuss recent advances in tracking the adaptation of phages to the dairy industry, the advances in understanding LAB phage-host interactions, including evolutionary and genomic aspects.
TI  - Development of a Reverse Line Blot Hybridization method for Detection of some Streptococcal/Lactococcal Species, the causative agents of Zoonotic Streptococosis/Lactococosis in farmed fish.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Streptococcosis/lactococcosis is the cause of high morbidity and mortality in aquaculture sector and to date a number of species of Streptococcus and Lactococcus genera including S. iniae, S. agalactiae, S. dysagalactiae, S. parauberis, S. feacalis, L. garvieae and L. lactis have been discriminated as the cause of disease in aquatic animals. Despite the use of diagnostic molecular methods for each of these bacterial species, no data is available on a suitable, rapid and simple simultaneous detection tool for these pathogens. This paper describes a simultaneous detection method which is PCR based on a reverse line blot (RLB) for rapid detection and differentiation of four species of genera of Streptococcus and Lactococcus genera consisting of S. iniae, S. agalactiae, S. parauberis and L. garvieae the most important agents of the disease in fish. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A reverse line blot (RLB) assay was developed for the simultaneously identification of four species of Streptococcus/lactococcusconsisting of S. iniae, S. parauberis, S. agalactiaeand Lactococcusgarvieae. The assay employs one set of primer pair for specific amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. These were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA gene sharing a homology region with Streptococcus spp. and Lactococcus spp. DNA was extracted from the pure bacterial colonies and amplified. A membrane was prepared with specific oligonucleotide for each bacterial species. PCR products were then hybridized to a membrane. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The amplification resulted in PCR product of 241 bp in length. No cross-reactions were observed between any of the tested bacterial species, and mixed DNAs from these four bacterial species were correctly identified. This RLB method is a suitable technique for a simultaneous detection of these species of bacterial fish pathogens that are some of the main causes of streptococcal/lactococcal infections in both freshwater and marine aquatic animals, and so we recommend its use for integrated epidemiological monitoring of streptococcosis/lactococcis in aquaculture industry.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides modify functional properties of whey protein concentrate.
AB  - The objective of this research was to produce whey protein concentrate (WPC) with modified functionality using exopolysaccharide- (EPS) producing cultures. Two different EPS-producing cultures, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JFR and Streptococcus thermophilus, producing EPS1 and EPS2 respectively, were used in this study. One EPS-nonproducing commercial cheese culture (DVS 850; Chr. Hansen, Milwaukee, WI) was used as the control. Reconstituted sweet whey powder was used in this study to eliminate variations from fresh whey. Cultures grown overnight in reconstituted WPC (10% wt/vol) were added, directly or after overnight cooling (cooled EPS), at 2% (wt/vol) to 6% (wt/wt) solution of reconstituted whey. Whey was then high-temperature, short-time pasteurized at 75 degrees C for 35s and ultrafiltered to a volume reduction factor of 5. Ultrafiltered whey (retentate) was spray dried at inlet and outlet air temperatures of 200 and 90 degrees C, respectively, to obtain WPC. In general, the solubility of WPC was higher at pH 7 than at pH 3. Whey protein concentrate containing EPS2 exhibited higher protein solubility than did WPC containing no EPS. Also, the presence of EPS in WPC decreased protein denaturation. The emulsifying ability of WPC containing EPS was higher than that in control. Addition of EPS to WPC significantly enhanced its gelling ability. Foam overrun and hydrophobicity of WPC were not affected by addition of EPS. In conclusion, data obtained from this study show that EPS modify WPC functionality. The extent of modification depends on the type of EPS. Cooling of culture containing EPS before its addition to whey further reduced WPC protein denaturation and increased its solubility at pH 7 and gel hardness.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Incorporation of Lactobacillus casei in Iranian ultrafiltered Feta cheese made by partial replacement of NaCl with KCl.
AB  - Probiotic Iranian ultrafiltered Feta cheese was produced from ultrafiltration of  milk with a volumetric concentration factor of 4.5:1. The heat-treated retentates were inoculated with 10(7) cfu of Lactobacillus casei LAFTI L26/mL. A mesophilic-thermophilic mixed culture of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus was also used. Three percent (wt/wt) salt with different ratios of NaCl:KCl (100% NaCl, 50% NaCl:50% KCl, 75% NaCl:25% KCl, and 25% NaCl:75% KCl) were used in cheese formulation. The viability of L. casei was determined in treatments during the ripening period (90d at 5 degrees C) within 15-d intervals. The pH, titratable acidity, and redox potential changes were monitored throughout the mentioned period. The mean pH drop rate, mean acidity increase rate, and mean redox potential increase rate were calculated at the end of the storage period. Also, total nitrogen, water-soluble nitrogen, lactic acid, and acetic acid concentrations, and syneresis and sensory characteristics of the product were measured during the mentioned period every 30d. The maximum viability of L. casei was observed within d 15 to 30 of the ripening period in the treatment containing the lowest amount of sodium. Addition of KCl enhanced syneresis. Cheeses with NaCl alone and with only 25% replacement by KCl have the highest sensory acceptability.
TI  - Antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  - Thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven Bifidobacterium, 11 Lactobacillus, six Lactococcus, and 10 Streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (TAA(AA) and TAA(LA)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), intracellular glutathione (TGSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Wide dispersion of each of TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, TGSH, and SOD occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. The strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 23032, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSMZ 23033, and Lactobacillus brevis DSMZ 23034 exhibited among the highest TAA(AA), TAA(LA), TEAC, and TGSH values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. These strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. The probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. The analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. Probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.
TI  - Pneumococcal neuraminidase A: an essential upper airway colonization factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the upper respiratory tract from where the organisms may disseminate systemically to cause life threatening infections. The mechanisms by which pneumococci colonize epithelia are not understood, but neuraminidase A (NanA) has a major role in promoting growth and survival in the upper respiratory tract. In this article we show that mutants of S. pneumoniae D39 deficient in NanA or neuraminidase B (NanB) are abrogated in adherence to three epithelial cell lines, and to primary nasopharyngeal cells. Adherence levels were partly restored by nanA complementation in trans. Enzymic activity of NanA was shown to be necessary for pneumococcal adherence to epithelial cells, and adherence of the nanA mutant was restored to wild-type level by pre-incubation of epithelial cells with Lactococcus lactis cells expressing NanA. Pneumococcal nanA or nanB mutants were deficient in biofilm formation, while expression of NanA on L. lactis or Streptococcus gordonii promoted biofilm formation by these heterologous host organisms. The results suggest that NanA is an enzymic factor mediating adherence to epithelial cells by decrypting receptors for adhesion, and functions at least in part as an adhesin in biofilm formation. Neuraminidase A thus appears to play multiple temporal roles in pneumococcal infection, from adherence to host tissues, colonization, and community development, to systemic spread and crossing of the blood-brain barrier.
TI  - PePPER: a webserver for prediction of prokaryote promoter elements and regulons.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of DNA motifs that are targets of RNA polymerases, sigma factors and transcription factors (TFs) in prokaryotes is a difficult mission mainly due to as yet undiscovered features in DNA sequences or structures in promoter regions. Improved prediction and comparison algorithms are currently available for identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and their accompanying TFs and regulon members. RESULTS: We here extend the current databases of TFs, TFBSs and regulons with our knowledge on Lactococcus lactis and developed a webserver for prediction, mining and visualization of prokaryote promoter elements and regulons via a novel concept. This new approach includes an all-in-one method of data mining for TFs, TFBSs, promoters, and regulons for any bacterial genome via a user-friendly webserver. We demonstrate the power of this method by mining WalRK regulons in Lactococci and Streptococci and, vice versa, use L. lactis regulon data (CodY) to mine closely related species. CONCLUSIONS: The PePPER webserver offers, besides the all-in-one analysis method, a toolbox for mining for regulons, promoters and TFBSs and accommodates a new L. lactis regulon database in addition to already existing regulon data. Identification of putative regulons and full annotation of intergenic regions in any bacterial genome on the basis of existing knowledge on a related organism can now be performed by biologists and it can be done for a wide range of regulons. On the basis of the PePPER output, biologist can design experiments to further verify the existence and extent of the proposed regulons. The PePPER webserver is freely accessible at http://pepper.molgenrug.nl.
TI  - Increase of stress resistance in Lactococcus lactis via a novel food-grade vector expressing a shsp gene from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The effects of the expression of a small heat shock protein (shsp) gene from Streptococcus thermophilus on stress resistance in Lactococcus lactis under different environmental stresses were investigated in this study. pMG36e-shsp, an expression vector, was first constructed by inserting a shsp open reading frame (ORF) cloned from S. thermophilus strain St-QC into pMG36e. Then, a food-grade expression vector, pMG-shsp, was generated by deleting the erythromycin resistance gene from pMG36e-shsp. The transformation rate of pMG-shsp was comparable to that of pMG36e-shsp when each of these two vectors was introduced into L. lactis. These results demonstrated that the shsp ORF could successfully used as a food-grade selection marker in both pMG-shsp and pMG36e-shsp. Furthermore, the growth characteristics were almost the same between L. lactis ML23 transformants harboring pMG36e or pMG-shsp. The survival rate of L. lactis ML23 expressing the shsp ORF were increased to 0.032%, 0.006%, 0.0027%, 0.03%, and 0.16% under the following environmental stresses: heat, acid, ethanol, bile salt and H2O2, respectively. These results indicated that the expression of the shsp gene in the food-grade vector pMG-shsp conferred resistance to environmental stresses without affecting the growth characteristics of L. lactis ML23.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(S/M) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The presence of antibiotic-resistance (AR) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. Streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. We have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (Tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne isolates of S. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. The gene was identified as a novel tet(S/M) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the N-terminal 33 amino acids of Tet(S), in-frame with the Tet(M) coding sequence. Heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer Tet resistance upon Escherichia coli recipients. Moreover, the tet(S/M) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by Tet under the endogenous tet(S) promoter in both S. bovis and E. coli. Nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of 16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of Streptococcus infantarius and Lactococcus lactis. A subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(S/M) was flanked by two copies of the IS1216 mobile element. PCR amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(S/M) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two IS1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. The circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pK214 from Lc. lactis, containing tet(S), as well as the IS1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. Linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.
TI  - Isolation and identification of cultivable lactic acid bacteria in traditional yak milk products of Gansu Province in China.
AB  - Various traditional fermented yak milk and raw milk foods could be considered as  an abundant resource for obtaining novel lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with unique properties. Eighty-eight samples of yak milk products were collected from Gansu Province in China. Three hundred and nineteen strains of LAB isolated from these samples were identified by phenotypic methods, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technology. Among the isolates, one hundred and sixty-four isolates (51.41% of the total) were classified under Lactobacilli, and one hundred and fifty-five (48.59%) belonged to cocci. All the isolates were classified to six genera (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Weissella) and twenty-one species. Lactobacillus helveticus (87 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (49 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (39 strains), Lactobacillus casei (31 strains) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (19 strains) were considered as the predominant populations in the yak milk products. The results showed that there were abundant genus and species LAB existing in yak milk products in Gansu Province in China. The obtained LAB pure cultures may be a valuable source for further starter selection.
TI  - A new binding site involving the C-terminal domain to design specific inhibitors  of PepX.
AB  - PepX is a X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase of S15 family that cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides having a proline or alanine residue at the second position. Involved in bacterial nutrition and in peptide maturation, this serine exopeptidase, counterpart of the mammalian DDP-4, has been proposed to play a role in pathogenicity for Streptococci and to be a promising target against trypanosomes. Searching for specific inhibitors, we undertook docking simulations on the whole surface of PepX from Lactococcus lactis, type example of the S15 family, which revealed a new putative binding site in connection with the active site and involving the C-terminal domain. Accordingly to the results of the computations, we synthesized two peptidomimetics of low molecular weight: the valinephenylpiperazine and the valine-isopropylpiperazine that can accommodate to this putative binding site. Experiments revealed that the valine-phenylpiperazine was an uncompetitive inhibitor whereas the valine-isopropylpiperazine showed to be an activator of the enzyme activity. The valine-phenylpiperazine is interacting with ASN 379, GLU 383, GLU 474, residues in connection with the specificity and active sites, and with the residues from the C-terminal domain LEU 693, GLU 710 and GLN 712. These results point out a role of the C-terminal domain in controlling access to the active site of enzymes of the S15 family, like PepX, the cocaine esterase or the alpha-amino acid ester hydrolase, and could have applications in human health giving new perspectives to struggle against streptococci or trypanosomes by designing inhibitors specific to the S15 family of enzymes.
TI  - Spherical lactic acid bacteria activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells immunomodulatory function via TLR9-dependent crosstalk with myeloid dendritic cells.
AB  - Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are a specialized sensor of viral and bacterial nucleic acids and a major producer of IFN-alpha that promotes host defense by priming both innate and acquired immune responses. Although synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, pathogenic bacteria and viruses activate pDC, there is limited investigation of non-pathogenic microbiota that are in wide industrial dietary use, such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this study, we screened for LAB strains, which induce pDC activation and IFN-alpha production using murine bone marrow (BM)-derived Flt-3L induced dendritic cell culture. Microbial strains with such activity on pDC were absent in a diversity of bacillary strains, but were observed in certain spherical species (Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Pediococcus), which was correlated with their capacity for uptake by pDC. Detailed study of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis JCM5805 and JCM20101 revealed that the major type I and type III interferons were induced (IFN-alpha, -beta, and lambda). IFN-alpha induction was TLR9 and MyD88-dependent; a slight impairment was also observed in TLR4(-/-) cells. While these responses occurred with purified pDC, IFN-alpha production was synergistic upon co-culture with myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), an interaction that required direct mDC-pDC contact. L. lactis strains also stimulated expression of immunoregulatory receptors on pDC (ICOS-L and PD-L1), and accordingly augmented pDC induction of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Treg compared to the Lactobacillus strain. Oral administration of L. lactis JCM5805 induced significant activation of pDC resident in the intestinal draining mesenteric lymph nodes, but not in a remote lymphoid site (spleen). Taken together, certain non-pathogenic spherical LAB in wide dietary use has potent and diverse immunomodulatory effects on pDC potentially relevant to anti-viral immunity and chronic inflammatory disease.
TI  - Rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - Probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. Here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in Columbia and Lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus sp. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16S rDNA genes. We tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qPCR that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of Lactobacillus spp. DNA/g. All products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. These bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus. MALDI-TOF MS presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. In one product we found L. lactis, instead of Bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus instead of Bifidus spp. MALDI-TOF MS allows a rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. Practical Application: MALDI-TOF MS is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.
TI  - Determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages collected from different regions of Turkey by using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. In the culture-independent detection, 10 different species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region. Among these species, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most dominant one in the kefir grains, while Lactococcus lactis was found to be significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. In the culture-dependent detection, the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16S rDNA full-length sequencing. According to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated species were L. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus kefiri, respectively. Only 3 species, which are L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. This study showed that the combination of both methods is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in kefir grains and kefir beverages. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Due to their artisan- and region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food products. Therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable effects on the product characteristics Artisan dairy products are a candidate source of such microorganisms. For this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions of Turkey were studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods.
TI  - Transcription analysis of hyaluronan biosynthesis genes in Streptococcus zooepidemicus and metabolically engineered Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The has operon genes in the hyaluronan (HA) producer, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, encode for some of the critical enzymes in the HA biosynthetic pathway. Heterologous expression of different combinations of multiple has genes has resulted in increasing HA production to varying degrees in different recombinant strains. In this work, a recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain (SJR6) was constructed, with insertion of three has operon genes (hasABD) from S. zooepidemicus. The SJR6 strain was found to be a better HA producer than two previously constructed recombinant L. lactis strains (SJR2 and SJR3), containing hasAB and hasABC genes, respectively, but exhibited lower HA production than the native HA producer S. zooepidemicus. To understand the differences in HA yield between the various strains, transcriptions of the HA biosynthesis genes (has genes and their homologues) were compared at different phases of exponential growth of the L. lactis and S. zooepidemicus cultures. The mRNA levels of all the heterologous has genes were expectedly far higher than their corresponding homologues in the L. lactis strains. The relative mRNA level of the hasB-homologue, viz. ugd (encoding UDP-glucose dehydrogenase), was found to be much lower than that of other homologues, corroborating earlier reports which indicate tight transcriptional regulation of the ugd gene in L. lactis. Interestingly, all the has gene homologues were found to be up-regulated in all the recombinant L. lactis strains, when compared with the corresponding genes in the untransformed strain, L. lactis NZ9000. A transcription analysis of S. zooepidemicus cultures revealed that the has operon was down-regulated in the mid-exponential growth phase in comparison to the early- and late-exponential growth phases. The transcription analyses in this study have provided insights for the design of recombinant strains with higher HA productivity.
TI  - A survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from Tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  - Kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in Tibet (China). It is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. Because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. In this study, a bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total DNA extracted from 30 samples of kurut. After screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (OTU) with unique RFLP patterns were obtained. Then, 1 representative sequence of every OTU was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Acetobacter. In addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in GenBank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. The characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.
TI  - Improved acid stress survival of Lactococcus lactis expressing the histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524.
AB  - Degradative amino acid decarboxylation pathways in bacteria generate secondary metabolic energy and provide resistance against acid stress. The histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524 was functionally expressed in the heterologous host Lactococcus lactis NZ9000, and the benefits of the newly acquired pathway for the host were analyzed. During growth in M17 medium in the pH range of 5-6.5, a small positive effect was observed on the biomass yield in batch culture, whereas no growth rate enhancement was evident. In contrast, a strong benefit for the engineered L. lactis strain was observed in acid stress survival. In the presence of histidine, the pathway enabled cells to survive at pH values as low as 3 for at least 2 h, conditions under which the host cells were rapidly dying. The flux through the histidine decarboxylation pathway in cells grown at physiological pH was under strict control of the electrochemical proton gradient (pmf) across the membrane. Ionophores that dissipated the membrane potential (DeltaPsi) and/or the pH gradient (DeltapH) strongly increased the flux, whereas the presence of glucose almost completely inhibited the flux. Control of the pmf over the flux was exerted by both DeltaPsi and DeltapH and was distributed over the transporter HdcP and the decarboxylase HdcA. The control allowed for a synergistic effect between the histidine decarboxylation and glycolytic pathways in acid stress survival. In a narrow pH range around 2.5 the synergism resulted in a 10-fold higher survival rate.
TI  - The branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase encoded by ilvE is involved in acid tolerance in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus mutans to produce and tolerate organic acids from carbohydrate metabolism represents a major virulence factor responsible for the formation of carious lesions. Pyruvate is a key metabolic intermediate that, when rerouted to other metabolic pathways such as amino acid biosynthesis, results in the alleviation of acid stress by reducing acid end products and aiding in maintenance of intracellular pH. Amino acid biosynthetic genes such as ilvC and ilvE were identified as being upregulated in a proteome analysis of Streptococcus mutans under acid stress conditions (A. C. Len, D. W. Harty, and N. A. Jacques, Microbiology 150:1353-1366, 2004). In Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus carnosus, the ilvE gene product is involved with biosynthesis and degradation of branched-chain amino acids, as well as in the production of branched-chain fatty acids (B. Ganesan and B. C. Weimer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70:638-641, 2004; S. M. Madsen et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 68:4007-4014, 2002; and M. Yvon, S. Thirouin, L. Rijnen, D. Fromentier, and J. C. Gripon, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63:414-419, 1997). Here we constructed and characterized an ilvE deletion mutant of S. mutans UA159. Growth experiments revealed that the ilvE mutant strain has a lag in growth when nutritionally limited for branched-chain amino acids. We further demonstrated that the loss of ilvE causes a decrease in acid tolerance. The ilvE strain exhibits a defect in F(1)-F(o) ATPase activity and has reduced catabolic activity for isoleucine and valine. Results from transcriptional studies showed that the ilvE promoter is upregulated during growth at low pH. Collectively, the results of this investigation show that amino acid metabolism is a component of the acid-adaptive repertoire of S. mutans.
TI  - Role of phosphate in the central metabolism of two lactic acid bacteria--a comparative systems biology approach.
AB  - Lactic acid-producing bacteria survive in distinct environments, but show common  metabolic characteristics. Here we studied the dynamic interactions of the central metabolism in Lactococcus lactis, extensively used as a starter culture in the dairy industry, and Streptococcus pyogenes, a human pathogen. Glucose-pulse experiments and enzymatic measurements were performed to parameterize kinetic models of glycolysis. Significant improvements were made to existing kinetic models for L. lactis, which subsequently accelerated the development of the first kinetic model of S. pyogenes glycolysis. The models revealed an important role for extracellular phosphate in the regulation of central metabolism and the efficient use of glucose. Thus, phosphate, which is rarely taken into account as an independent species in models of central metabolism, should be considered more thoroughly in the analysis of metabolic systems in the future. Insufficient phosphate supply can lead to a strong inhibition of glycolysis at high glucose concentrations in both species, but this was more severe in S. pyogenes. S. pyogenes is more efficient at converting glucose to ATP, showing a higher tendency towards heterofermentative energy metabolism than L. lactis. Our comparative systems biology approach revealed that the glycolysis of L. lactis and S. pyogenes have similar characteristics, but are adapted to their individual natural habitats with respect to phosphate regulation.
TI  - Heterologous expression of pneumococcal virulence factor PspC on the surface of Lactococcus lactis confers adhesive properties.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is a non-pathogenic bacterium that is used in the food industry but is also used as a heterologous host to reveal protein functions of pathogenic bacteria. The adhesin PspC from Streptococcus pneumoniae is a choline-binding protein that is non-covalently anchored to the bacterial cell wall. To assess the exclusive impact of pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) on the interplay with its host we generated recombinant L. lactis producing a nisin-inducible and covalently anchored variant of PspC on the lactococcal cell surface. A translational fusion of the 5'-end of pspC3.4 with the 3'-end of hic (pspC11.4) was designed to decorate the surface of L. lactis with a chimeric PspC. The PspC3.4 part comprises the first 281 aa residues of PspC3.4, while the Hic sequence consists of the proline-rich and sortase-anchored domain. The results demonstrated that PspC is sufficient for adhesion and subsequent invasion of host epithelial cells expressing the human polymeric Ig receptor (hpIgR). Moreover, invasion via hpIgR was even more pronounced when the chimeric PspC was produced by lactococci compared with pneumococci. This study shows also for the first time that PspC plays no significant role during phagocytosis by macrophages. In contrast, recruitment of Factor H via the PspC chimer has a dramatic effect on phagocytosis of recombinant but not wild-type lactococci, as Factor H interacts specifically with the amino-terminal part of PspC and mediates the contact with phagocytes. Furthermore, L. lactis expressing PspC increased intracellular calcium levels in pIgR-expressing epithelial cells, thus resembling the effect of pneumococci, which induced release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores via the PspC-pIgR mechanism. In conclusion, expression of the chimeric PspC confers adhesive properties to L. lactis and indicates the potential of L. lactis as a suitable host to study the impact of individual bacterial factors on their capacity to interfere with the host and manipulate eukaryotic epithelial cells.
TI  - From meadows to milk to mucosa - adaptation of Streptococcus and Lactococcus species to their nutritional environments.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are indigenous to food-related habitats as well as associated with the mucosal surfaces of animals. The LAB family Streptococcaceae consists of the genera Lactococcus and Streptococcus. Members of the family include the industrially important species Lactococcus lactis, which has a long history safe use in the fermentative food industry, and the disease-causing streptococci Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The central metabolic pathways of the Streptococcaceae family have been extensively studied because of their relevance in the industrial use of some species, as well as their influence on virulence of others. Recent developments in high-throughput proteomic and DNA-microarray techniques, in in vivo NMR studies, and importantly in whole-genome sequencing have resulted in new insights into the metabolism of the Streptococcaceae family. The development of cost-effective high-throughput sequencing has resulted in the publication of numerous whole-genome sequences of lactococcal and streptococcal species. Comparative genomic analysis of these closely related but environmentally diverse species provides insight into the evolution of this family of LAB and shows that the relatively small genomes of members of the Streptococcaceae family have been largely shaped by the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit.
TI  - The streptococcal collagen-like protein-1 (Scl1) is a significant determinant for biofilm formation by group A Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human-specific pathogen responsible  for a number of diseases characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. During host colonization GAS-cell aggregates or microcolonies are observed in tissues. GAS biofilm, which is an in vitro equivalent of tissue microcolony, has only recently been studied and little is known about the specific surface determinants that aid biofilm formation. In this study, we demonstrate that surface-associated streptococcal collagen-like protein-1 (Scl1) plays an important role in GAS biofilm formation. RESULTS: Biofilm formation by M1-, M3-, M28-, and M41-type GAS strains, representing an intraspecies breadth, were analyzed spectrophotometrically following crystal violet staining, and characterized using confocal and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The M41-type strain formed the most robust biofilm under static conditions, followed by M28- and M1-type strains, while the M3-type strains analyzed here did not form biofilm under the same experimental conditions. Differences in architecture and cell-surface morphology were observed in biofilms formed by the M1- and M41-wild-type strains, accompanied by varying amounts of deposited extracellular matrix and differences in cell-to-cell junctions within each biofilm. Importantly, all Scl1-negative mutants examined showed significantly decreased ability to form biofilm in vitro. Furthermore, the Scl1 protein expressed on the surface of a heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis, was sufficient to induce biofilm formation by this organism. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this work (i) identifies variations in biofilm formation capacity among pathogenically different GAS strains, (ii) identifies GAS surface properties that may aid in biofilm stability and, (iii) establishes that the Scl1 surface protein is an important determinant of GAS biofilm, which is sufficient to enable biofilm formation in the heterologous host Lactococcus. In summary, the GAS surface adhesin Scl1 may have an important role in biofilm-associated pathogenicity.
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Intraspecific and interspecific interactions among proteins regulating exopolysaccharide synthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus iniae, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and the assessment of potential lateral gene transfer.
AB  - Using the yeast two-hybrid system, intraspecific protein interactions were detected in Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris between the transmembrane activation protein (CpsC and EpsA, respectively) and the protein tyrosine kinase (CpsD and EpsB, respectively), between two protein tyrosine kinases, and between the protein tyrosine kinase and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase (CpsB and EpsC, respectively). For each of these intraspecific interactions, interspecific interactions were also detected when one protein was from S. iniae and the other was from Streptococcus thermophilus . Interactions were also observed between two protein tyrosine kinases when one protein was from either of the Streptococcus species and the other from L. lactis subsp. cremoris. The results and sequence comparisons performed in this study support the conclusion that interactions among the components of the tyrosine kinase - phosphatase regulatory system are conserved in the order Lactobacillales and that interspecific genetic exchanges of the genes that encode these proteins have the potential to form functional recombinants. A better understanding of intraspecific and interspecific protein interactions involved in regulating exopolysaccharide biosynthesis may facilitate construction of improved strains for industrial uses as well as identification of factors needed to form functional regulatory complexes in naturally occurring recombinants.
TI  - The spiFEG locus in Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius BAA-102 confers  protection against nisin U.
AB  - Nisin U is a member of the extended nisin family of lantibiotics. Here we identify the presence of nisin U immunity gene homologues in Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius BAA-102. Heterologous expression of these genes in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris HP confers protection to nisin U and other members of the nisin family, thereby establishing that the recently identified phenomenon of resistance through immune mimicry also occurs with respect to nisin.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a Streptococcus gallolyticus genomic island encoding a pilus involved in endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus is a causative agent of infective endocarditis associated with colon cancer. Genome sequence of strain UCN34 revealed the existence of 3 pilus loci (pil1, pil2, and pil3). Pili are long filamentous structures playing a key role as adhesive organelles in many pathogens. The pil1 locus encodes 2 LPXTG proteins (Gallo2178 and Gallo2179) and 1 sortase C (Gallo2177). Gallo2179 displaying a functional collagen-binding domain was referred to as the adhesin, whereas Gallo2178 was designated as the major pilin. METHODS: S. gallolyticus UCN34, Pil1(+) and Pil1(-), expressing various levels of pil1, and recombinant Lactococcus lactis strains, constitutively expressing pil1, were studied. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the putative pilin subunits Gallo2178 and Gallo2179 were used in immunoblotting and immunogold electron microscopy. The role of pil1 was tested in a rat model of endocarditis. RESULTS: We showed that the pil1 locus (gallo2179-78-77) forms an operon differentially expressed among S. gallolyticus strains. Short pilus appendages were identified both on the surface of S. gallolyticus UCN34 and recombinant L. lactis-expressing pil1. We demonstrated that Pil1 pilus is involved in binding to collagen, biofilm formation, and virulence in experimental endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies Pil1 as the first virulence factor characterized in S. gallolyticus.
TI  - Salt effect of nisin Z isolated from a marine fish on the growth inhibition of Streptococcus iniae, a pathogen of streptococcosis.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was isolated from the intestine of olive flounder. The bacteriocin was identified as nisin Z. It was active against Gram-positive bacteria. Nisin Z at 3,200 arbitrary units (AU) was more effective in seawater than in PBS; growth of Streptococcus iniae was completely inhibited within 3 h. Nisin Z preparations with 3.5% (w/v) NaCl was the most effective against S. iniae being similar to nisin Z in seawater. Nisin Z is thus a good alternative to antibiotics to prevent streptococcosis caused by S. iniae aquaculture systems.
TI  - An in vitro investigation of Lactococcus lactis antagonizing cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study tested the antagonism between Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus mutans and evaluated the feasibility of the application of L. lactis for the inhibition of S. mutans in the oral cavity. METHODS: Competition assays on plates were employed to determine whether L. lactis antagonises S. mutans under different nutritional conditions, and real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR was used to evaluate the effects of metabolites of S. mutans on the bacteriocin nisin genes in L. lactis. Furthermore, the colonisation and effects of L. lactis on the surface of a tooth were examined by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: L. lactis competitively inhibited S. mutans growth under nutritional deficiency, and the metabolites of S. mutans, including several exogenous molecular signals, enhanced the expression of genes related to nisin synthesis, nisA, nisB and nisI. Additionally, L. lactis effectively colonised the surface of tooth enamel, which showed substantially less decay with L. lactis adhesion compared to S. mutans adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest avenues of research into a new strategy to reduce major cariogenic S. mutans adhesion on the surfaces of teeth.
TI  - The impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  - Understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. Therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (FMP) containing a consortium of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced FMP strains. No significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed in the feces of humans consuming the FMP. Only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the FMP consortium. However, RNA-Seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the FMP strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. B. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the FMP consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. The human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of FMP consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to plant polysaccharide metabolism. These experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of FMPs on the human gut microbiome.
TI  - Cascade cell lyses and DNA extraction for identification of genes and microorganisms in kefir grains.
AB  - Kefir is a dairy product popular in many countries in Central Europe, especially  in Poland and other countries of Eastern and Northern Europe. This type of fermented milk is produced by a complex population of symbiotic bacteria and yeasts. In this work, conditions for DNA extraction, involving disruption of kefir grains and a cascade of cell lysis treatments, were established. Extraction procedure of total microbial DNA was carried out directly from fresh kefir grains. Using different lysis stringency conditions, five DNA pools were obtained. Genetic diversity of DNA pools were validated by RAPD analysis, which showed differences in patterns of amplified DNA fragments, indicating diverse microbial composition of all the analysed samples. These DNA pools were used for construction of genomic DNA libraries for sequencing. As much as 50% of the analysed nucleotide sequences showed homology to sequences from bacteria belonging to the Lactobacillus genus. Several sequences were similar to sequences from bacteria representing Lactococcus, Oenococcus, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and Leuconostoc species. Among homologues of yeast proteins were those from Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, several sequences were found to be homologous to sequences from bacteriophages.
TI  - The spatial distribution of bacteria in Grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  - The microbial composition and its spatial distribution of Grana Trentino, a hard  Parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. After cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and the cheese core. After two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. Milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic bacterial counts. Thermophilic bacteria (Lactobacillus helveticus) were found in high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. After 9 months of ripening, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts were higher than those after 18 months. Furthermore, the LAB numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. The main LAB species isolated from milk (Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Streptococcus uberis and Lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. Some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. Microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of LAB. In each sample, all LAB were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter LAB (NSLAB) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of Grana Trentino cheese.
TI  - Utilization of UF-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus casei and Lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in MRS broth and three lactococci strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in M17 broth. L. reuteri and S. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 U/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. The maximum production of beta-galactosidase by L. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial pH 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g N/L and incubation temperature at 30 degrees C/24 hrs to give 6.31 U/ml. While in case of S. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (KH2PO4:K2HPO4, g/L), at initial pH 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate (0.66g N/L) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees C for 24 hrs to give 7.85 U/ml.
TI  - Food-grade gene expression in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In the 1990s, significant efforts were invested in the research and development of food-grade expression systems in lactic acid bacteria (LAB). At this time, Lactococcus lactis in particular was demonstrated to be an ideal cell factory for the food-grade production of recombinant proteins. Steady progress has since been made in research on LAB, including Lactococcus, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus, in the areas of recombinant enzyme production, industrial food fermentation, and gene and metabolic pathway regulation. Over the past decade, this work has also led to new approaches on chromosomal integration vectors and host/vector systems. These newly constructed food-grade gene expression systems were designed with specific attention to self-cloning strategies, food-grade selection markers, plasmid replication and chromosomal gene replacements. In this review, we discuss some well-characterized chromosomal integration and food-grade host/vector systems used in LAB, with a special focus on sustainability, stability and overall safety, and give some attractive examples of protein expression that are based on these systems.
TI  - Culture-independent detection of microorganisms in traditional Slovakian bryndza  cheese.
AB  - In order to investigate the microflora of Slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, DNA was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. Using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions with variable length were amplified. The standard universal reverse primer L1 aligning to bacterial 23s rDNA was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. Therefore, L1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers GplusR and GminusR aligning to the adjacent, more conserved DNA region. The amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. From representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. Sequencing revealed that the samples contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Streptococcus macedonicus, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Debaromyces hansenii, Mucor fragilis, Yarrowia lipolytica and Galactomyces geotrichum. These results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of Slovakian bryndza cheese. The introduced automated ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.
TI  - Reidentification of Streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  - All Streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from January 2003 to January 2010 (n = 52) at the Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. Initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic Wider system (Fco. Soria-Melguizo, Spain) and the API 20 Strep system (bioMerieux, France). All isolates were reidentified by PCR amplification and sequencing of both the 16S rRNA and sodA genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Bruker, Germany). Results of 16S rRNA/sodA gene sequencing were as follows: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16S rRNA/number of isolates identified by sodA gene sequencing); Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; Streptococcus spp., 7/0; Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; Streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 4/0; and Lactococcus lactis, 3/3. MALDI-TOF MS identified 27 S. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 L. mesenteroides isolates, 3 L. lactis isolates, and 6 S. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. The percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. The most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). We conclude that sequencing of the sodA gene was the most discriminatory method and that S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.
TI  - Streptococcus pyogenes antigen I/II-family polypeptide AspA shows differential ligand-binding properties and mediates biofilm formation.
AB  - The streptococcal antigen I/II (AgI/II)-family polypeptides are cell wall-anchored adhesins expressed by most indigenous oral streptococci. Proteins sharing 30-40% overall amino acid sequence similarities with AgI/II-family proteins are also expressed by Streptococcus pyogenes. The S. pyogenes M28_Spy1325 polypeptide (designated AspA) displays an AgI/II primary structure, with alanine-rich (A) and proline-rich (P) repeats flanking a V region that is projected distal from the cell. In this study it is shown that AspA from serotype M28 S. pyogenes, when expressed on surrogate host Lactococcus lactis, confers binding to immobilized salivary agglutinin gp-340. This binding was blocked by antibodies to the AspA-VP region. In contrast, the N-terminal region of AspA was deficient in binding fluid-phase gp-340, and L. lactis cells expressing AspA were not agglutinated by gp-340. Deletion of the aspA gene from two different M28 strains of S. pyogenes abrogated their abilities to form biofilms on saliva-coated surfaces. In each mutant strain, biofilm formation was restored by trans complementation of the aspA deletion. In addition, expression of AspA protein on the surface of L. lactis conferred biofilm-forming ability. Taken collectively, the results provide evidence that AspA is a biofilm-associated adhesin that may function in host colonization by S. pyogenes.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Poly(dimethyl siloxane) surface modification with biosurfactants isolated from probiotic strains.
AB  - Depending on the final application envisaged for a given biomaterial, many surfaces must be modified before use. The material performance in a biological environment is mainly mediated by its surface properties that can be improved using suitable modification methods. The aim of this work was to coat poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) surfaces with biosurfactants (BSs) and to evaluate how these compounds affect the PDMS surface properties. BSs isolated from four probiotic strains (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus A, and Streptococcus thermophilus B) were used. Bare PDMS and PDMS coated with BSs were characterized by contact angle measurements, infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The influence of the surface modifications on the materials blood compatibility was studied through thrombosis and hemolysis assays. The cytotoxicity of these materials was tested against rat peritoneal macrophages. AFM results demonstrated the successful coating of the surfaces. Also, by contact angle measurements, an increase of the coated surfaces hydrophilicity was seen. Furthermore, XPS analysis indicated a decrease of the silicon content at the surface, and ATR-FTIR results showed the presence of BS characteristic groups as a consequence of the modification. All the studied materials revealed no toxicity and were found to be nonhemolytic. The proposed approach for the modification of PDMS surfaces was found to be effective and opens new possibilities for the application of these surfaces in the biomedical field.
TI  - Defense from the Group A Streptococcus by active and passive vaccination with the streptococcal hemoprotein receptor.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide burden of the Group A Streptococcus (GAS) primary infection and sequelae is considerable, although immunization programs with broad coverage of the hyper variable GAS are still missing. We evaluate the streptococcal hemoprotein receptor (Shr), a conserved streptococcal protein, as a vaccine candidate against GAS infection. METHODS: Mice were immunized intraperitoneally with purified Shr or intranasally with Shr-expressing Lactococcus lactis. The resulting humoral response in serum and secretions was determined. We evaluated protection from GAS infection in mice after active or passive vaccination with Shr, and Shr antiserum was tested for bactericidal activity. RESULTS: A robust Shr-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G response was observed in mouse serum after intraperitoneal vaccination with Shr. Intranasal immunization elicited both a strong IgG reaction in the serum and a specific IgA reaction in secretions. Shr immunization in both models allowed enhanced protection from systemic GAS challenge. Rabbit Shr antiserum was opsonizing, and mice that were administrated with Shr antiserum prior to the infection demonstrated a significantly higher survival rate than did mice treated with normal rabbit serum. CONCLUSIONS: Shr is a promising vaccine candidate that is capable of eliciting bactericidal antibody response and conferring immunity against systemic GAS infection in both passive and active vaccination models.
TI  - Presence of ISS1-like insertion sequence in wild type Streptococcus uberis strains isolated from cases of bovine mastitis.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis is a major cause of environmental mastitis worldwide. In spite of significant economic losses caused by S. uberis in many well-managed dairy herds, virulence factors and mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of S. uberis mastitis are not well known. The ability of S. uberis to attach to and internalize into mammary epithelial cells and subsequent intracellular survival enables it to avoid host defense mechanisms. Research to determine virulence factors responsible for these pathogenic strategies involved creating a random chromosomal mutant library of S. uberis strain UT888 using the thermosensitive plasmid pGh9:ISS1 mutagenesis system. During Southern blot analysis of the mutant library, an endogenous element similar to ISS1 insertion sequence of Lactococcus lactis was found. ISS1 is a transposable bacterial insertion sequence isolated originally from L. lactis and are small phenotypically cryptic sequences of DNA with a simple genetic organization and capable of inserting at multiple sites in a target molecule. They are flanked by inverted repeats; generally encode their own transposition functions. A total of 29 of 34 wild type strains of S. uberis evaluated were positive for ISS1 by Southern blot. Insertion of ISS1 might have a significant phenotypic and genotypic role in the S. uberis genome because of its ability to transpose within the genome.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial community responsible for traditional fermentation during sour cassava starch, cachaca and minas cheese production using culture-independent 16s rRNA gene sequence analysis.
AB  - We used a cultivation-independent, clone library-based 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to identify bacterial communities present during traditional fermentation in sour cassava starch, cachaca and cheese production in Brazil. Partial 16S rRNA gene clone sequences from sour cassava starch samples collected on day five of the fermentation process indicated that Leuconostoc citreum was the most prevalent species, representing 47.6% of the clones. After 27 days of fermentation, clones (GenBank accession numbers GQ999786 and GQ999788) related to unculturable bacteria were the most prevalent, representing 43.8% of the clones from the bacterial community analyzed. The clone represented by the sequence GQ999786 was the most prevalent at the end of the fermentation period. The majority of clones obtained from cachaca samples during the fermentation of sugar cane juice were from the genus Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus nagelli was the most prevalent at the beginning of the fermentation process, representing 76.9% of the clones analyzed. After 21 days, Lactobacillus harbinensis was the most prevalent species, representing 75% of the total clones. At the end of the fermentation period, Lactobacillus buchneri was the most prevalent species, representing 57.9% of the total clones. In the Minas cheese samples, Lactococcus lactis was the most prevalent species after seven days of ripening. After 60 days of ripening, Streptococcus salivarius was the most prevalent species. Our data show that these three fermentation processes are conducted by a succession of bacterial species, of which lactic acid bacteria are the most prevalent.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in serum and ascitic fluid of asymptomatic outpatients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic ascites.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bacterial DNA (bactDNA) has been found in serum and ascitic  fluid (AF) of 30-40% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic ascites, but its prevalence in outpatients is unknown. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the presence of bactDNA in AF and serum among cirrhotic outpatients with non-neutrocytic ascites. METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic ascites, who underwent therapeutic paracentesis in our outpatient clinic, were enrolled over a 13-week period. Of these patients, 13 had a single paracentesis and 18 patients had several consecutive paracenteses (2-10) over the study period. Overall, 98 serum and non-neutrocytic AF specimens were obtained and tested for the presence of bactDNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. RESULTS: The main causes of cirrhosis were alcohol (53.5%) and hepatitis C (30%). The median MELD score was 16 and there were 54.8% Child-Pugh C patients. BactDNA was negative in all samples from 28 of the 31 patients, including 15 patients with several paracentesis. One patient had a single AF sample culture positive and bactDNA positive for Streptococcus mitis, whereas the simultaneous blood sample was negative. For each of the last two patients, DNA from Lactococcus lactis was detected in a single blood sample but not in the simultaneous AF sample. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to that reported previously in hospitalized patients, bactDNA is rarely detected in serum and AF of outpatients with cirrhosis and non-neutrocytic ascites.
TI  - Development of a pentaplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermentum in whey starter for Grana Padano cheese.
AB  - A pentaplex PCR assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and L. fermentum, was developed. The target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (L. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (L. fermentum). The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Enterococcus genera. The identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)CFU/ml. This new molecular assay was used to investigate the LAB population by direct extraction of DNA from the 12 whey cultures for Grana Padano. The pentaplex PCR assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor LAB community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.
TI  - Bioengineering of a Nisin A-producing Lactococcus lactis to create isogenic strains producing the natural variants Nisin F, Q and Z.
AB  - Nisin is the prototypical example of the lantibiotic family of antimicrobial peptides and has been employed as a food preservative for over half a century. It has also attracted attention due to its potency against a number of multidrug-resistant clinical pathogens. Nisin A is the originally isolated form of Nisin and a further five natural variants have been described which differ by up to 10 amino acids (of 34 in total in Nisin A). Nisins A, Z, F and Q are produced by Lactococcus lactis, while Nisins U and U2 are produced by Streptococcus sp. In this study we bioengineered the nisA gene of a Nisin A producer to generate genes encoding Nisins Z, F, Q, U and U2. We determined that while active Nisin Z, F and Q can be produced against this genetic background, active forms of Nisin U and U2 are not generated. Minimum inhibitory concentration studies with Nisin A, Z, F and Q variants against a series of different clinically significant pathogens establish differences in specific activities against selected targets. Nisin F was most impressive, being the most active, or one of the most active, against the MRSA strain ST 525, EC 676, EC 725, VISA 22900, VISA 22781, hVISA 35197, Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 and L. lactis HP. Nisin Z was most active against ST 299, hVISA 32683 and, together with Nisin F, HP but had contrastingly poor activity against ST 525, EC 676 and 8325-4. Nisin F, Q and A exhibited similar potency against VISA 22900. This was the only target against which Nisin Q and Nisin A were among the most active variants.
TI  - Screening for antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors via genome sequencing.
AB  - Second-generation genome sequencing and alignment of the resulting reads to in silico genomes containing antimicrobial resistance and virulence factor genes were used to screen for undesirable genes in 28 strains which could be used in human nutrition. No virulence factor genes were detected, while several isolates contained antimicrobial resistance genes.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis as an adjuvant and delivery vehicle of antigens against pneumococcal respiratory infections.
AB  - Most studies of Lactococcus lactis as delivery vehicles of pneumococcal antigens  are focused on the effectiveness of mucosal recombinant vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae in animal models. At present, there are three types of pneumococcal vaccines: capsular polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines (PPV), protein-polysaccharide conjugate pneumococcal vaccines (PCV) and protein-based pneumococcal vaccines (PBPV). Only PPV and PCV have been licensed. These vaccines, however, do not represent a definitive solution. Novel, safe and inexpensive vaccines are necessary, especially in developing countries. Probiotic microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are an interesting alternative for their use as vehicles in pneumococcal vaccines due to their GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status. Thus, the adjuvanticity of Lactococcus lactis by itself represents added value over the use of other bacteria, a question dealt with in this review. In addition, the expression of different pneumococcal antigens as well as the use of oral and nasal mucosal routes of administration of lactococcal vaccines is considered. The advantages of nasal live vaccines are evident; nonetheless, oral vaccines can be a good alternative when the adequate dose is used. Another point addressed here is the use of live versus inactivated vaccines. In this sense, few researchers have focused on inactivated strains to be used as vaccines against pneumoccoccus. The immunogenicity of live vaccines is better than the one afforded by inactivated ones; however, the probiotic-inactivated vaccine combination has improved this matter considerably. The progress made so far in the protective immune response induced by recombinant vaccines, the successful trials in animal models and the safety considerations of their application in humans suggest that the use of recombinant vaccines represents a good short-term option in the control of pneumococcal diseases.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented West African cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  - In this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in Nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. In particular, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE fingerprints identified species related to Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. A more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the Lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the Streptococcaceae family. Interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. For example, L. plantarum, L. pantheris and L. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while W. confusa, Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. Phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - HdcB, a novel enzyme catalysing maturation of pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.
AB  - Pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylases are produced as proenzymes that mature by cleavage followed by formation of the pyruvoyl prosthetic group. The histidine decarboxylation pathway of Streptococcus thermophilus CHCC1524 that consists of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase HdcA and the histidine/histamine exchanger HdcP was functionally expressed in Lactococcus lactis. The operon encoding the pathway contains in addition to the hdcA and hdcP genes a third gene hdcB. Expression of different combinations of the genes in L. lactis and Escherichia coli followed by analysis of the protein products demonstrated the involvement of HdcB in the cleavage of the HdcA proenzyme. The HdcA proenzyme and HdcB protein were purified to homogeneity and cleavage and activation of the histidine decarboxylase activity was demonstrated in vitro. Substoichiometric amounts of HdcB were required to cleave HdcA showing that HdcB functions as an enzyme. In agreement, expression levels of HdcB in the cells were low relative to those of HdcA. The turnover number of HdcB in vitro was extremely low (0.05 min(-)(1)) which was due to a very slow association/dissociation of the enzyme/substrate complex. In fact, HdcB was shown to co-purify both with the HdcA S82A mutant that mimics the proenzyme and with the mature HdcA complex.
TI  - Gene cluster for biosynthesis of thermophilin 1277--a lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277, and heterologous expression of TepI, a novel immunity peptide.
AB  - AIMS: To identify genes cluster for thermophilin 1277 produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SBT1277. METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify genes for thermophilin 1277 production, the chromosomal DNA region surrounding the structural gene, tepA, was sequenced using a primer-walking method. The thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis gene locus (tep) is a 9.9-kb region, which consists of at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) in the following order: tepAMTFEGKRI and ORF4. Homology analysis showed high similarity to genes involved in bovicin HJ50 production by Streptococcus bovis HJ50. tepI encodes a novel, small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 52 amino acids, which contains a putative transmembrane segment. By heterologous expression in Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363, the TepI-expressing strain exhibited at least 1.3 times higher resistance to thermophilin 1277. CONCLUSIONS: Thermophilin 1277 biosynthesis genes were encoded by a 9.9-kbp region containing at least ten ORFs. TepI is a novel immunity peptide, which protected Strep. thermophilus SBT1277 against thermophilin 1277 in addition to TepFEG, a putative ABC transporter. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report regarding a lantibiotic gene cluster produced by Strep. thermophilus strain.
TI  - Characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants shows optimization for YATP (cell mass produced per mole of ATP) at their physiological pHs.
AB  - Several lactic acid bacteria use homolactic acid fermentation for generation of ATP. Here we studied the role of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme on the general physiology of the three homolactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Of note, deletion of the ldh genes hardly affected the growth rate in chemically defined medium under microaerophilic conditions. However, the growth rate was affected in rich medium. Furthermore, deletion of ldh affected the ability for utilization of various substrates as a carbon source. A switch to mixed acid fermentation was observed during glucose-limited continuous growth and was dependent on the growth rate for S. pyogenes and on the pH for E. faecalis. In S. pyogenes and L. lactis, a change in pH resulted in a clear change in Y(ATP) (cell mass produced per mole of ATP). The pH that showed the highest Y(ATP) corresponded to the pH of the natural habitat of the organisms.
TI  - FTIR-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Greek Graviera cheese.
AB  - This study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (Fourier Transformed Infra-Red [FTIR] spectroscopy) and molecular (RFLP and SSCP analysis of 16S rRNA genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora present in traditional Greek Graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. A total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of TSAYE (incubated at 30 degrees C), M-17 (22 degrees C) and M-17 (42 degrees C) agar media were clustered by FTIR and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by all methods. Based on their FTIR spectra, 282 isolates were LAB grouped in 28 clusters. The LAB species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), Enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and Lactococcus lactis (0.7%). Also, Staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), Corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and Brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from TSAYE. Comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the LAB species identified. The present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid FTIR screening of 10-fold more isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant LAB species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.
TI  - A novel plasmid for delivering genes into mammalian cells with noninvasive food and commensal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Using food and commensal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as vehicles for DNA delivery  into epithelial cells is a new strategy for vaccine delivery or gene therapy. However, present methods for DNA delivery with LAB have suffered low efficiency. Our goal was to develop a new system to deliver DNA into epithelial cells with high efficiency using food and commensal LAB. An Escherichia coli-LAB shuttle plasmid, pLKV1, for DNA delivery into eukaryotic cells was constructed. Two reporter plasmids with green and red fluorescent protein genes were also constructed to monitor the uptake of protein and DNA, respectively. Bacteria delivering these reporter plasmids into Caco-2 cells were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Several methods that weaken the bacterial cell wall prior to co-culture with Caco-2 cells were evaluated for their role in the improvement of gene transfer efficiency. Treating Streptococcus gordonii with penicillin and lysozyme greatly increased its rate of gene delivery to mammalian cells compared to untreated control bacteria, while glycine pretreatment promoted the highest gene transfer rate for Lactococcus lactis. Uptake of green fluorescent bacteria by Caco-2 cells showed that the cell wall-weakening treatment promoted the internalization of the noninvasive bacteria into Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, we have developed a noninvasive system using LAB as a vehicle for vaccine delivery or gene therapy, and tested this system in vitro with Caco-2 cells.
TI  - Heterologous expression of glycoside hydrolase family 2 and 42 beta-galactosidases of lactic acid bacteria in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - This study characterized a glycoside hydrolase family 42 (GH42) beta-galactosidase of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LacA) and compared lactose hydrolysis, hydrolysis of oNPG, pNPG and pNPG-analogues and galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) formation to GH2 beta-galactosidases of Streptococcus thermophilus (LacZ type), Lactobacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (both LacLM type). Beta-galactosidases were heterologously expressed in Lactococcus lactis using a p170 derived promoter; experiments were performed with L. lactis crude cell extract (CCE). The novel GH42 beta-galactosidase of Lb. acidophilus had lower activity on lactose, oNPG and pNPG but higher relative activity on pNP analogues compared to GH2 beta-galactosidases, and did not transgalactosylate at high lactose concentrations. Temperature and pH optima for lactose hydrolysis varied between GH2 beta-galactosidases. oNPG and pNPG were the preferred substrates for hydrolysis; in comparison, activity on pNPG-analogues was less than 1.5%. GH2 beta-galactosidases formed structurally similar GOS with varying preferences. The diversity of lactic acid bacteria beta-galactosidase activity in L. lactis CCE can be exploited in future nutritional or therapeutic applications.
TI  - Interaction of Candida albicans cell wall Als3 protein with Streptococcus gordonii SspB adhesin promotes development of mixed-species communities.
AB  - Candida albicans colonizes human mucosa and prosthetic surfaces associated with artificial joints, catheters, and dentures. In the oral cavity, C. albicans coexists with numerous bacterial species, and evidence suggests that bacteria may modulate fungal growth and biofilm formation. Streptococcus gordonii is found on most oral cavity surfaces and interacts with C. albicans to promote hyphal and biofilm formation. In this study, we investigated the role of the hyphal-wall protein Als3p in interactions of C. albicans with S. gordonii. Utilizing an ALS3 deletion mutant strain, it was shown that cells were not affected in initial adherence to the salivary pellicle or in hyphal formation in the planktonic phase. However, the Als3(-) mutant was unable to form biofilms on the salivary pellicle or deposited S. gordonii DL1 wild-type cells, and after initial adherence, als3Delta/als3Delta (DeltaALS3) cells became detached concomitant with hyphal formation. In coaggregation assays, S. gordonii cells attached to, and accumulated around, hyphae formed by C. albicans wild-type cells. However, streptococci failed to attach to hyphae produced by the DeltaALS3 mutant. Saccharomyces cerevisiae S150-2B cells expressing Als3p, but not control cells, supported binding of S. gordonii DL1. However, S. gordonii Delta(sspA sspB) cells deficient in production of the surface protein adhesins SspA and SspB showed >50% reduced levels of binding to S. cerevisiae expressing Als3p. Lactococcus lactis cells expressing SspB bound avidly to S. cerevisiae expressing Als3p, but not to S150-2B wild-type cells. These results show that recognition of C. albicans by S. gordonii involves Als3 protein-SspB protein interaction, defining a novel mechanism in fungal-bacterial communication.
TI  - Microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
AB  - The diversity, dynamics and activity of Castelmagno PDO cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the Grana Valley (northwest Italy), during the wintertime. Samples of milk, curd and cheese (core and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. In particular, DNA and RNA directly extracted from the matrices were studied by PCR-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-DGGE. Culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species Streptococcus thermophilus and S. agalactiae. Then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with Lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of Castelmagno PDO ripening. At this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lb. casei. Culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of L. lactis, actively involved in both Castelmagno PDO manufacturing and ripening. Despite Lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a DGGE band referred to this microorganism was detected, at RNA level, in samples from ripened cheeses. On the other hand, Lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. Due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
TI  - Nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  - Nisin, produced by Lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. In the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. In the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different MIC, MBC and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. There was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in PBS and saliva (p>0.05). Furthermore, morphology and membranes of Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus fermenti and Lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). Our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.
TI  - Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  - The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.
TI  - Detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for enumeration of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci was established. Subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16S or 23S rRNA from Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus were newly developed. The RT-qPCR method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the Enterococcus genus, the Streptococcus genus, and several Streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qPCR method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces). The RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the genus-specific primer sets revealed that Enterococcus and Streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), respectively. Detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique Enterococcus species, including the E. avium subgroup, the E. faecium subgroup, E. faecalis, the E. casseliflavus subgroup, and E. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal Streptococcus species was found to be S. salivarius. Various Lactococcus species, such as L. lactis subsp. lactis or L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. garvieae, L. piscium, and L. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram feces) and prevalence (33%). These results suggest that the RT-qPCR method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Resistance of young mice to pneumococcal infection can be improved by oral vaccination with recombinant Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Oral immunization with Lactococcus lactis PppA (LPA+), a recombinant strain that is able to express the pneumococcal protective protein A, can improve the resistance to respiratory challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae in adult mice. In this study, we investigated whether oral immunization protocols using LPA+ are able to protect young mice against pneumococcal respiratory infection. METHODS: Young mice (aged, 3 weeks) were immunized orally with LPA+ for 5 consecutive days. Vaccination was performed once (non-boosted group), or twice with a 2-week interval between each immunization (boosted group). At the end of treatment, the specific immune responses and the resistance to pneumococcal infection were studied. RESULTS: We found that the oral immunization with LPA+ was able to induce the production of specific antibodies in the respiratory and intestinal tracts as well as systemically. Analysis of IgG subtypes showed that LPA+ immunization stimulated a mixed Th1 and Th2 response. To assess whether the production of mucosal and systemic antibodies was able to afford protection against respiratory pneumococcal infection, challenge experiments with the pathogenic serotypes 3, 6B, 14, and 23F were carried out. Vaccination with LPA+ was able to increase resistance to infection with the four serotypes of S. pneumoniae, although the protective capacity of the experimental vaccine was different for each of them. Immunization decreased colonization in the lung, prevented bacteremia of serotypes 6B, 14, and 23F, and decreased colony counts of serotype 3. CONCLUSION: We have shown that the oral immunization of young mice with LPA+ effectively induces the production of specific antibodies against the antigen PppA, both in mucosae and at the systemic level. The antibodies produced may play an important role in the protection against pneumococcal disease, since the young mice immunized with the experimental vaccine showed an increased resistance to infection with different serotypes of the pathogen.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Role of antioxidant enzymes in bacterial resistance to organic acids.
AB  - Growth in aerobic environments has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to cause oxidative stress in most organisms. Antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutases and hydroperoxidases) and DNA repair mechanisms provide protection against ROS. Acid stress has been shown to be associated with the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the relationship between acid stress and oxidative stress is not well understood. In the present study, we showed that mutations in the gene coding for MnSOD (sodA) increased the toxicity of lactic acid at pH 3.5 in Streptococcus thermophilus. The inclusion of the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl (DIP), diethienetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), and O-phenanthroline (O-Phe) provided partial protection against 330 mM lactic acid at pH 3.5. The results suggested that acid stress triggers an iron-mediated oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by MnSOD and iron chelators. These findings were further validated in Escherichia coli strains lacking both MnSOD and iron SOD (FeSOD) but expressing a heterologous MnSOD from S. thermophilus. We also found that, in E. coli, FeSOD did not provide the same protection afforded by MnSOD and that hydroperoxidases are equally important in protecting the cells against acid stress. These findings may explain the ability of some microorganisms to survive better in acidified environments, as in acid foods, during fermentation and accumulation of lactic acid or during passage through the low pH of the stomach.
TI  - Analysis of the genome content of Lactococcus garvieae by genomic interspecies microarray hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactococcus garvieae is a bacterial pathogen that affects different animal species in addition to humans. Despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of L. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content of this microorganism. In the present study, the genomic content of L. garvieae CECT 4531 was analysed using bioinformatics tools and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 and Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 were used as reference microorganisms. RESULTS: The combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro CGH experiments, performed in comparison with the reference microorganisms, allowed establishment of an inter-species hybridization framework with a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of >or= 70%. With this threshold value, 267 genes were identified as having an analogue in L. garvieae, most of which (n = 258) have been documented for the first time in this pathogen. Most of the genes are related to ribosomal, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems. Some of the identified genes, such as als and mycA, could be involved in the pathogenesis of L. garvieae infections. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified 267 genes that were potentially present in L. garvieae CECT 4531. Some of the identified genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of L. garvieae infections. These results provide the first insight into the genome content of L. garvieae.
TI  - Pecorino Crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal Pecorino Crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout cheese ripening, with the dominance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus species. Bacterial dynamics determined by Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus buchneri and Leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. Moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. Fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of Pecorino Crotonese cheeses by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from  marketed foods and drugs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and E-test methods after species-level identification. Resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by PCR. RESULTS: Distribution of resistance was found in different species. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. In addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. In contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. The genes msrC, vanX, and dfrA were detected in strains of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. Evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.
TI  - Chemokine-cleaving Streptococcus pyogenes protease SpyCEP is necessary and sufficient for bacterial dissemination within soft tissues and the respiratory tract.
AB  - SpyCEP is a Streptococcus pyogenes protease that cleaves CXCL8/IL-8 and its activity is associated with human invasive disease severity. We investigated the role of SpyCEP in S. pyogenes necrotizing fasciitis and respiratory tract infection in mice using isogenic strains differing only in SpyCEP expression. SpyCEP cleaved human CXCL1, 2, 6 and 8 plus murine CXCL1 and 2 at a structurally conserved site. Mice were infected in thigh muscle with a strain of S. pyogenes that expresses a high level of SpyCEP, or with an isogenic non-SpyCEP expressing strain. SpyCEP expression by S. pyogenes hindered bacterial clearance from muscle, and enhanced bacterial spread, associated with cleavage of murine chemoattractant CXCL1. Mice were then infected with Lactococcus lactis strains that differed only in SpyCEP expression. In contrast to the parent L. lactis strain (lacks SpyCEP), which was avirulent when administered intramuscularly, infection with a strain that expressed SpyCEP heterologously led to dramatic systemic illness within 24 h, failure to clear bacteria from muscle and marked dissemination to other organs. In the upper airways, SpyCEP expression was required for survival of L. lactis but not S. pyogenes. However, dissemination of S. pyogenes to the lung was SpyCEP-dependent and was associated with evidence of chemokine cleavage. Taken together, the studies provide clear evidence that SpyCEP is necessary and sufficient for systemic bacterial dissemination from a soft tissue focus in this model and also underlies dissemination in the respiratory tract.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus sakei R1333 isolated  from smoked salmon.
AB  - Strain R1333, isolated from commercially available smoked salmon, was identified  as Lactobacillus sakei based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (API 50 CHL), PCR with species-specific primers and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Strain R1333 produces a 3811 kDa class IIa bacteriocin, active against Streptococcus caprinus, Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus spp., L. sakei, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and Listeria monocytogenes. The mode of activity against L. innocua 2030C and L. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii ATCC 19119 was bactericidal, resulting in cell lysis and enzyme- and DNA-leakage. The highest level of activity (1600 AU/mL) was recorded when cells were grown at 30 degrees C in MRS broth (initial pH 6.5). Only 800 AU/mL was recorded when strain R1333 was grown in MRS without Tween 80. Lower levels of bacteriocin production were recorded when strain R1333 was grown in MRS at 20 degrees C. Peptide R1333 adsorbs at low levels (200 AU/mL) to producer cells. Purification of bacteriocin R1333 was performed by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by separation on a SepPak C(18) column and reverse-phase HPLC on a Nucleosil C(18) column with a linear gradient from 0.1% TFA to 90% acetonitryl. A molecular mass of 3811 kDa was determined by mass spectrometry. Based on mass spectrometry and sequencing of the PCR amplified fragment targeting the sakG gene, L. sakei R1333 is a potential producer of sakacin G. This is the first report of the identification of sakacin G produced by L. sakei isolated from smoked salmon.
TI  - Production of a class II two-component lantibiotic of Streptococcus pneumoniae using the class I nisin synthetic machinery and leader sequence.
AB  - Recent studies showed that the nisin modification machinery can successfully dehydrate serines and threonines and introduce lanthionine rings in small peptides that are fused to the nisin leader sequence. This opens up exciting possibilities to produce and engineer larger antimicrobial peptides in vivo. Here we demonstrate the exploitation of the class I nisin production machinery to generate, modify, and secrete biologically active, previously not-yet-isolated and -characterized class II two-component lantibiotics that have no sequence homology to nisin. The nisin synthesis machinery, composed of the modification enzymes NisB and NisC and the transporter NisT, was used to modify and secrete a putative two-component lantibiotic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This was achieved by genetically fusing the propeptide-encoding sequences of the spr1765 (pneA1) and spr1766 (pneA2) genes to the nisin leader-encoding sequence. The chimeric prepeptides were secreted out of Lactococcus lactis, purified by cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography, and further characterized. Mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated the presence and partial localization of multiple dehydrated serines and/or threonines and (methyl)lanthionines in both peptides. Moreover, after cleavage of the leader peptide from the prepeptides, both modified propeptides displayed antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus flavus. These results demonstrate that the nisin synthetase machinery can be successfully used to modify and produce otherwise difficult to obtain antimicrobially active lantibiotics.
TI  - Identification of tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci within the fermenting microflora of an Italian dairy food product.
AB  - AIMS: Microbiological and molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive cocci derived from the Italian PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) dairy food product Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and seven coccal colonies were assigned to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus bovis genera by ARDRA analysis (amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis). Among them, 16 Ent. faecalis, 26 L. lactis and 39 Strep. bovis displayed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for tetracycline, while 17 L. lactis showed high MIC values for both tetracycline and erythromycin. Strain typing and molecular analysis of the phenotypically resistant isolates demonstrated the presence of the tet(M) gene in the tetracycline-resistant strains and of tet(S) and erm(B) in the double-resistant strains. Southern blot analysis revealed plasmid localization of L. lactis tet(M), as well as of the erm(B) and tet(S) genes. Genetic linkage of erm(B) and tet(S) was also demonstrated by PCR amplification. Conjugation experiments demonstrated horizontal transfer to Ent. faecalis strain JH2-2 only for the plasmid-borne L. lactis tet(M) gene. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized tetracycline-and erythromycin-resistance genes in coccal species, representing the fermenting microflora of a typical Italian dairy product. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results are of particular relevance from the food safety viewpoint, especially in the light of the potential risk of horizontal transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes among foodborne commensal bacteria.
TI  - A foreign protein incorporated on the Tip of T3 pili in Lactococcus lactis elicits systemic and mucosal immunity.
AB  - The use of Lactococcus lactis to deliver a chosen antigen to the mucosal surface  has been shown to elicit an immune response in mice and is a possible method of vaccination in humans. The recent discovery on Gram-positive bacteria of pili that are covalently attached to the bacterial surface and the elucidation of the residues linking the major and minor subunits of such pili suggests that the presentation of an antigen on the tip of pili external to the surface of L. lactis might constitute a successful vaccine strategy. As a proof of principle, we have fused a foreign protein (the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein) to the C-terminal region of the native tip protein (Cpa) of the T3 pilus derived from Streptococcus pyogenes and expressed this fusion protein (MBP*) in L. lactis. We find that MBP* is incorporated into pili in this foreign host, as shown by Western blot analyses of cell wall proteins and by immunogold electron microscopy. Furthermore, since the MBP* on these pili retains its native biological activity, it appears to retain its native structure. Mucosal immunization of mice with this L. lactis strain expressing pilus-linked MBP* results in production of both a systemic and a mucosal response (IgG and IgA antibodies) against the MBP antigen. We suggest that this type of mucosal vaccine delivery system, which we term UPTOP (for unhindered presentation on tips of pili), may provide an inexpensive and stable alternative to current mechanisms of immunization for many serious human pathogens.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2.
TI  - Administration of a probiotic associated with nasal vaccination with inactivated  Lactococcus lactis-PppA induces effective protection against pneumoccocal infection in young mice.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a serious public health problem, especially in developing countries, where available vaccines are not part of the vaccination calendar. We evaluated different respiratory mucosa immunization protocols that included the nasal administration of Lactococcus lactis-pneumococcal protective protein A (PppA) live, inactivated, and in association with a probiotic (Lc) to young mice. The animals that received Lc by the oral and nasal route presented the highest levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG anti-PppA antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and IgG in serum, which no doubt contributed to the protection against infection. However, only the groups that received the live and inactivated vaccine associated with the oral administration of the probiotic were able to prevent lung colonization by S. pneumoniae serotypes 3 and 14 in a respiratory infection model. This would be related to a preferential stimulation of the T helper type 1 (Th1) cells at local and systemic levels and with a moderate Th2 and Th17 response, shown by the cytokine profile induced in BAL and by the results of the IgG1/IgG2a ratio at local and systemic levels. Nasal immunization with the inactivated recombinant strain associated with oral Lc administration was able to stimulate the specific cellular and humoral immune response and afford protection against the challenge with the two S. pneumoniae serotypes. The results obtained show the probiotic-inactivated vaccine association as a valuable alternative for application to human health, especially in at-risk populations, and are the first report of a safe and effective immunization strategy using an inactivated recombinant strain.
TI  - Nisin-induced expression of pediocin in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To test whether a single vector, nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system  could be used to regulate expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus casei. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intact pediocin operon was cloned immediately into pMSP3535 downstream of the nisA promoter (PnisA). The resulting vector, pRSNPed, was electrotransformed into Strep. thermophilus ST128, L. lactis subsp. lactis ML3 and Lact. casei C2. Presence of the intact vector was confirmed by PCR, resulting in the amplification of a 0.8-kb DNA fragment, and inhibition zones were observed for all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformants following induction with 50 ng ml(-1) nisin, when Listeria monocytogenes Scott A was used as the target bacterium. Using L. monocytogenes NR30 as target, the L. lactis transformants produced hazy zones of inhibition, while the Lact. casei transformants produced clear zones of inhibition. Zones of inhibition were not observed when the Strep. thermophilus transformants were tested against NR30. CONCLUSIONS: The LAB hosts were able to produce enough pediocin to inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A; the growth of L. monocytogenes NR30 was effectively inhibited only by the Lact. casei transformants. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that the NICE system has been used to express the intact pediocin operon in these LAB hosts. This system could allow for the in situ production of pediocin in fermented dairy foods supplemented with nisin to prevent listeria contamination.
TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. In this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. One hundred and two unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylations from 84 S. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of TiO(2) enrichment and LC-MS/MS determination. The identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. A striking characteristic of S. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.
TI  - Hyaluronic acid production is enhanced by the additional co-expression of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) production was metabolically engineered in Lactococcus lactis by introducing the HA synthetic machinery from the has operon of the pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus zooepidemicus. This study shows that the insertion of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose pyrophosphorylase (hasC) gene in addition to the HA synthase (hasA) and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (hasB) genes has a significant impact on increasing HA production. The recombinant L. lactis NZ9000 strain transformed with the plasmid pSJR2 (co-expressing hasA and hasB genes only) produced a maximum of 107 mg/l HA in static flask experiments with varying initial glucose concentrations, while the corresponding experiments with the transformant SJR3 (co-expressing hasA, hasB, and hasC genes) gave a maximum yield of 234 mg/l HA. The plasmid cloned with the insertion of the full has operon comprising of five different genes (hasA, hasB, hasC, hasD, and hasE) exhibited structural instability. The HA yield was further enhanced in batch bioreactor experiments with controlled pH and aeration, and a maximum of 1.8 g/l HA was produced by the SJR3 culture.
TI  - Diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of Casin, a traditional Spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  - Classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional Spanish Casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. As with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of Casin was shown to be high by both culturing and DGGE analyses. The culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. Of the 14 bacterial species identified, Lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. As expected, the DGGE profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. Among these, a band corresponding to Streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. This species had never been identified from traditional Spanish cheeses previously. Culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of Casin manufacture. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling suggested that the L. garvieae and L. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. In addition, only a single L. lactis RAPD pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. After a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two Lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for Casin. Additional species (such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.
TI  - Efficacy of a teat dip containing the bacteriocin lacticin 3147 to eliminate Gram-positive pathogens associated with bovine mastitis.
AB  - On most dairy farms teat dips are applied to the teats of cows either before or after milking in order to prevent pathogens from gaining access to the mammary gland via the teat canal. In the present experiments, a natural teat dip was developed using a fermentate containing the live bacterium Lactococcus lactis DPC 3251. This bacterium produces lacticin 3147, a two-component lantibiotic which was previously shown to effectively kill Gram-positive mastitis pathogens. Lacticin 3147 activity in the fermentate was retained at 53% of its original level following storage for 3 weeks at 4 degrees C. In the initial experiments in vitro, 105 colony-forming units/ml (cfu/ml) of either Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae or Streptococcus uberis were introduced into the lacticin-containing fermentate. Neither Staph. aureus nor Str. dysgalactiae could be detected after 30 min or 15 min, respectively, while Str. uberis was reduced approximately 100-fold after 15 min. Following these trials, preliminary experiments were performed in vivo on teats of lactating dairy cows. In these experiments, teats were coated with each of the challenge organisms and then dipped with the lacticin-containing fermented teat dip. Following a dip contact time of 10 min, staphylococci were reduced by 80% when compared with the undipped control teat. Streptococcal challenges were reduced by 97% for Str. dysgalactiae and by 90% for Str. uberis. These trials showed that the teat dip is able to reduce mastitis pathogens on the teats of lactating cows.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the Bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The major objective of the present study is to change the alanine production of Lactic acid bacteria by expression of Bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH), the gene that is not present in Lactic acid. B. subtilis AlaDH gene (ald) was cloned into a pGEX6p-1 and expressed in E. coli JM109. Its enzyme activity was 48.3U/mg at 30 degrees C and 45.2U/mg at 42 degrees C. This ald gene was then cloned into a vector pNZ8148 to generate a vector pNZ8148/ald. The same ald gene was placed downstream of the ldh promoter from Streptococcus thermophilus to generate pNZ273/ldhp/ald. The pNZ8148/ald and pNZ273/ldhp/ald were introduced separately in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. As a result of over-expressed ald, the production of alanine detected by HPLC in L. lactis NZ9000 carrying pNZ273/ldhp/ald reached 52mug/ml, an approximately 26-fold increase compared to the parent strain L. lactis NZ9000, but not in L. lactis NZ9000 carrying pNZ8148/ald. This study would help strain improvement to be used in dairy fermentation for developing healthy yogurts with sweet taste or other fermented dairy foods.
TI  - Multiple adhesin proteins on the cell surface of Streptococcus gordonii are involved in adhesion to human fibronectin.
AB  - Adhesion of bacterial cells to fibronectin (FN) is thought to be a pivotal step in the pathogenesis of invasive infectious diseases. Viridans group streptococci such as Streptococcus gordonii are considered commensal members of the oral microflora, but are important pathogens in infective endocarditis. S. gordonii expresses a battery of cell-surface adhesins that act alone or in concert to bind host receptors. Here, we employed molecular genetic approaches to determine the relative contributions of five known S. gordonii surface proteins to adherence to human FN. Binding levels to FN by isogenic mutants lacking Hsa glycoprotein were reduced by 70 %, while mutants lacking CshA and CshB fibrillar proteins showed approximately 30 % reduced binding. By contrast, disruption of antigen I/II adhesin genes sspA and sspB in a wild-type background did not result in reduced FN binding. Enzymic removal of sialic acids from FN led to reduced S. gordonii DL1 adhesion (>50 %), but did not affect binding by the hsa mutant, indicating that Hsa interacts with sialic acid moieties on FN. Conversely, desialylation of FN did not affect adherence levels of Lactococcus lactis cells expressing SspA or SspB polypeptides. Complementation of the hsa mutant partially restored adhesion to FN. A model is proposed for FN binding by S. gordonii in which Hsa and CshA/CshB are primary adhesins, and SspA or SspB play secondary roles. Understanding the basis of oral streptococcal interactions with FN will provide a foundation for development of new strategies to control infective endocarditis.
TI  - Improvement of constipation and liver function by plant-derived lactic acid bacteria: a double-blind, randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) contribute to human health; however, the probiotic properties vary among strains classified into the same species. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of yogurts made by different types of LAB on the gastrointestinal system. The yogurts were also evaluated by measuring serum lipid contents and liver functional indicators as a secondary objective. METHODS: Healthy human adults (n = 68) with some complaints with regard to intestinal health, including constipation and diarrhea, were randomly assigned to receive one of three types of yogurt in a double-blind manner: type A, a yogurt made by plant-derived LAB (mainly Lactobacillus [Lb.] plantarum SN35N); type B, a yogurt made by plant-derived LAB (mainly Lb. plantarum SN13T); and type C, a yogurt made by animal-derived LAB (mainly Lactococcus lactis A6 and Streptococcus thermophilus 510) as a control. The subjects consumed 100 g of yogurt daily for 6 wk. Data were collected from clinical visits at 2-wk intervals and by diaries used to record defecation and health conditions. RESULTS: Drastic and constant increments of defecation frequency in subjects with constipation were observed with type A and B yogurts but not with type C yogurt. Type B and C yogurts resulted in decreases in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The serum concentrations of liver functional parameters were improved by the type B yogurt (12-25% reduction). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that Lb. plantarum SN13T exhibits a superior probiotic effect on constipation in addition to improving the serum lipid contents and liver function.
TI  - Production of bacteriocins by Streptococcus bovis strains from Australian ruminants.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the prevalence of bacteriocin production in Streptococcus bovis  isolates from Australian ruminants and the feasibility of industrial production of bacteriocin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Streptococcus bovis strains were tested for production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) by antagonism assay against Lactococcus lactis. BLIS production was associated with source animal location (i.e. proximity of other bacteriocin-positive source animals) rather than ruminant species/breed or diet. One bacteriocin showing strong inhibitory activity (Sb15) was isolated and examined. Protein sequence, stability and activity spectrum of this bovicin were very similar to bovicin HC5. Production could be increased through serial culturing, and increased productivity could be partially maintained during cold storage of cultures. CONCLUSIONS: BLIS production is geographically widely distributed in Eastern Australia, and it appears that the bacteriocin(+) trait is maintained in animals at the same location. The HC5-like bacteriocin, originally identified in North America, is also found in Australia. Production of bacteriocin can be increased through serial culturing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The HC5-like bacteriocins appear to have a broad global distribution. Serial culturing may provide a route towards commercial manufacturing for use in industrial applications, and purified bacteriocin from S. bovis Sb15 could potentially be used to prevent food spoilage or as a feed additive to promote growth in ruminant species.
TI  - Influence of long-term consumption of a Lactococcus lactis strain on the intestinal immunity and intestinal flora of the senescence-accelerated mouse.
AB  - The senescence-accelerated mouse develops normally until 5-6 months of age and then displays rapid and irreversible advancement of senescence manifesting as clinical signs and gross lesions. To clarify the effect of lactic acid bacteria on the physiological changes with increasing age, heat-killed Lactococcus lactis G50 was administered to 1-month-old senescence-accelerated-prone mouse (SAMP)6 mice for 11 months, a senescence-accelerated mouse strain that develops senile osteoporosis. Mice fed G50 gained more weight than the control mice (not fed G50) during the feeding experiment. Faecal IgA levels in the mice fed G50 at 3 months were higher than those of the control mice but decreased to control levels with increasing age. The numbers of viable cells of Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus/Streptococcus sp. and Enterobacteriaceae sp. in faeces were similar for mice fed the G50 and control diets at any age, but strain G50 suppressed the intestinal growth of H2S-producing bacteria. Bone density of the thigh bone did not differ between aged G50 and control mice. Strain G50 would be a beneficial bacterium for the enhancement of intestinal immunity during youth and to suppress the growth of harmful intestinal bacteria. The applicability of strain G50 for the food and animal industries has been proposed in the present study.
TI  - Screening and characterization of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from cultured common carp intestine.
AB  - Screening of potential probiotic LAB for aquaculture from adult common carp intestine was performed seasonally. Lactococcus lactis h2 and Lactococcus raffinolactis h47, which show cholic acid resistance and strong antibacterial activity against fish pathogens, were selected from predominant LAB in summer and winter respectively. Enterococcus pseudoavium h50, with the strongest antimicrobial activity among the strains isolated through 1 year, was also selected. Streptococcus iniae I1, with strong antimicrobial activity, was selected from predominant LAB in young common carp intestine. Direct screening of LAB with cholic acid resistance was also carried out seasonally. The antibacterial activity of the isolates was tested, and Lactobacillus fuchuensis K11 was selected from the summer isolates. In addition, five candidate strains were selected from the winter samples. The candidates' levels of cholic acid resistance and antibacterial activity were better than or at the least matched those of their corresponding type strains. All the candidates grew over a wide range of temperatures.
TI  - Main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of Ugandan ghee.
AB  - Ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western Uganda. However, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. The aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. L. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. Two of the four most commonly isolated LAB species (L. helveticus and L. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (PCR-DGGE). Other main LAB species identified in mashita by PCR-DGGE were Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus sp., Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius. The main species of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified in the mashita using PCR-DGGE method were Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. PCR-DGGE identification of yeasts showed that Brettanomyces custersianus, Candida silvae, Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia occidentalis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. A. lovaniensis, A. aceti, and I. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using PCR-DGGE method. Other microbial species were only found in some samples. These results indicate that LAB and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also AAB are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.
TI  - Possible promoter regions within the proteolytic system in Streptococcus thermophilus and their interaction with the CodY homolog.
AB  - Possible promoter regions preceding 14 genes belonging to the proteolytic system  of Streptococcus thermophilus KLDS 3.0503 were predicted by a promoter analysis software nnpp. The 14 genes included an extracellular protease gene prtS, an oligopeptide ABC transport system gene amiA1, and 12 genes, respectively, encoding peptidases pepA, pepS, pepN, pepC, pepB, pepQ, pepV, pepT, pepM, pepXP, pepP, and pepO. These predicted promoter sequences were cloned and inserted into the upstream of a promoterless Escherichia coli gusA (beta-glucuronidase) gene in a promoter probe vector pNZ273. The resulting vectors were, respectively, introduced into S. thermophilus KLDS 3.0503 and all 14 predicted promoter sequences were able to drive gusA expression, which indicated that these sequences were functional promoters. These promoters were able to interact with the S. thermophilus CodY homolog in an in vitro DNA binding assay but they did not contain a conserved CodY-box sequence identified in Lactococcus lactis. These results were useful for further studies on the regulation of protein metabolism in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and DNA identification of atypical Lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. By combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16S rRNA gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west Algeria. Forty strains phenotypically related to cocci LAB were identified as belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and other Enterococcus species. No Streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. Ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. In particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% NaCl, at pH 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. Lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. Further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Heme and menaquinone induced electron transport in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. In this report, we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait. RESULTS: Heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species and genera of lactic acid bacteria. These include Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacilllus brevis, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Streptococcus entericus and Lactococcus garviae. The increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits, are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 Lactococcus lactis insertion mutants. Respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxA, bd-type cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. Phenotypic screening and in silico genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species. CONCLUSION: We propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes among the species.
TI  - [Manipulation of NADH metabolism in industrial strains].
AB  - Nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NADH), the key cofactor in the metabolic network, plays an essential role in biochemical reaction and physiological function of industrial strains. Manipulation of NADH availability and form is an efficient and easy way to redirect the carbon flux to the target metabolites in industrial strains. We reviewed the physiological function of NADH. Detailed strategies to manipulate NADH availability are addressed. NADH manipulation to enhance metabolic function of industrial strains was discussed and potential solutions were suggested.
TI  - Hyaluronan molecular weight is controlled by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine concentration in Streptococcus zooepidemicus.
AB  - The molecular weight of hyaluronan is important for its rheological and biological function. The molecular mechanisms underlying chain termination and hence molecular weight control remain poorly understood, not only for hyaluronan synthases but also for other beta-polysaccharide synthases, e.g. cellulose, chitin, and 1,3-betaglucan synthases. In this work, we manipulated metabolite concentrations in the hyaluronan pathway by overexpressing the five genes of the hyaluronan synthesis operon in Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Overexpression of genes involved in UDP-glucuronic acid biosynthesis decreased molecular weight, whereas overexpression of genes involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis increased molecular weight. The highest molecular mass observed was at 3.4 +/- 0.1 MDa twice that observed in the wild-type strain, 1.8 +/- 0.1 MDa. The data indicate that (a) high molecular weight is achieved when an appropriate balance of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid is achieved, (b) UDP-N-acetylglucosamine exerts the dominant effect on molecular weight, and (c) the wild-type strain has suboptimal levels of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Consistent herewith molecular weight correlated strongly (rho = 0.84, p = 3 x 10(-5)) with the concentration of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Data presented in this paper represent the first model for hyaluronan molecular weight control based on the concentration of activated sugar precursors. These results can be used to engineer strains producing high molecular weight hyaluronan and may provide insight into similar polymerization mechanisms in other polysaccharides.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria by broth microdilution method and Etest.
AB  - We applied two methods of broth microdilution and Etest for measuring minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for 15 antimicrobial agents to compare the feasibility, reproducibility, and equivalence of the two methods. Both methods were originally described by the European projects PROSAFE and ACE-ART. In 84% combinations of strains and antimicrobial agents MIC differences between the two methods were within one Log(2) dilution. In the case of rifampicin the difference between the two methods was more than ten-fold. We further determined MICs of 70 strains (14 strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 16 strains of Lactococcus lactis, 30 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and 10 strains of Bifidobacterium longum) by the broth microdilution method. In most cases, MIC distributions were uni-modal and within 5 Log(2) dilutions except for the MIC distribution of L. lactis to the aminoglycoside group which was broader. These data are a good basis for improving knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and can be used to revise tentative epidemiological cut-off values.
TI  - Genome-scale model of Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 for metabolic comparison of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this report, we describe the amino acid metabolism and amino acid dependency of the dairy bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311 and compare them with those of two other characterized lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum. Through the construction of a genome-scale metabolic model of S. thermophilus, the metabolic differences between the three bacteria were visualized by direct projection on a metabolic map. The comparative analysis revealed the minimal amino acid auxotrophy (only histidine and methionine or cysteine) of S. thermophilus LMG18311 and the broad variety of volatiles produced from amino acids compared to the other two bacteria. It also revealed the limited number of pyruvate branches, forcing this strain to use the homofermentative metabolism for growth optimization. In addition, some industrially relevant features could be identified in S. thermophilus, such as the unique pathway for acetaldehyde (yogurt flavor) production and the absence of a complete pentose phosphate pathway.
TI  - Use of induction promoters to regulate hyaluronan synthase and UDP-glucose-6-dehydrogenase of Streptococcus zooepidemicus expression in Lactococcus lactis: a case study of the regulation mechanism of hyaluronic acid polymer.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effects of the ratios of hyaluronan synthase expression level to precursor sugar UDP-GlcA biosynthesis ability on the molecular weight (MW) of hyaluronic acid (HA) in recombinant Lactococcus lactis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The genes szHasA (hyaluronan synthase gene) and szHasB (UDP-glucose-6-dehydrogenase gene) of Streptococcus zooepidemicus were introduced into L. lactis under the control of nisA promoter and lacA promoter respectively, resulting in a dual-plasmid controlled expression system. The effects of the ratios of hyaluronan synthase expression level to the precursor sugar UDP-GlcA biosynthesis ability under different induction concentration collocations with nisin and lactose on the MW of HA in recombinant L. lactis were determined. The results showed that the final weight-average molecular weight () of HA correlated with the relative ratios of HasA (hyaluronan synthase) expression level to the concentration of UDP-GlcA. CONCLUSIONS: Regulating the relative ratios of HasA expression level to the precursor sugar biosynthesis ability was an efficient method to control the size of HA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study put forward a guide to establish an efficacious way to control the size of HA in fermentation.
TI  - Study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for Fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  - The bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of Fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. Total microbial DNA was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to study the hypervariable V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Representative bands of DGGE patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. The use of universal primer for PCR-DGGE allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also for other adventitious species. DGGE profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. Some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) recurred in many samples (Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. The microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant LAB but also adventitious bacteria (Macrococcus caseolyticus, Rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (Chryseobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees C of coagulated milk. Pantoea spp. was primarily found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. Finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of E. faecium, E. faecalis and S. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. These species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.
TI  - Characteristics of the bovicin HJ50 gene cluster in Streptococcus bovis HJ50.
AB  - Bovicin HJ50 is a new lantibiotic containing a disulfide bridge produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50; its encoding gene bovA was reported in our previous publication. To identify other genes involved in bovicin HJ50 production, DNA fragments flanking bovA were cloned and sequenced. The bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis gene locus was encoded by a 9.9 kb region of chromosomal DNA and consisted of at least nine genes in the following order: bovA, -M, -T, -E, -F, ORF1, ORF2, bovK and bovR. A thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase gene named sdb1 was located downstream of bovR. A knockout mutant of this gene retained antimicrobial activity and the molecular mass of bovicin HJ50 in the mutant was the same as that of bovicin HJ50 in S. bovis HJ50, implying that sdb1 is not involved in bovicin HJ50 production. Transcriptional analyses showed that bovA, bovM and bovT constituted an operon, and the transcription start site of the bovA promoter was located at a G residue 45 bp upstream of the translation start codon for bovA, while bovE through bovR were transcribed together and the transcription start site of the bovE promoter was located at a C residue 35 bp upstream of bovE. We also demonstrated successful heterologous expression of bovicin HJ50 in Lactococcus lactis MG1363, which lacks thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes; this showed that thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase genes other than sdb1 are not essential for bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements ICESt1 and ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. The current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ICEs in Streptococcus thermophilus, ICESt1 and ICESt3. Mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent, derepresses ICESt3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. The ICESt3 host range was determined using various members of the Firmicutes as recipients. Whereas numerous ICESt3 transconjugants of Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of Lactococcus lactis was obtained. The newly incoming ICEs, except the one from L. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. Furthermore, ICESt3 was retransferred from E. faecalis to S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the ICESt1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ICEs, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.
TI  - Development of chemically defined media supporting high-cell-density growth of lactococci, enterococci, and streptococci.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was used as an experimental strain to develop a chemically defined medium for study of the physiology and metabolic pathways of lactococci. An experimental leave-one-out technique was employed to determine the necessity of each of the 57 chemical components used in medium development. A statistical experimental design approach including three fractional factorial designs and a central composite design was used to optimize the fermentation process with 21 variables composed of 19 nutritional factors grouped from the 57 components and two environmental factors (initial pH and temperature). For L. lactis IL1403, the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the two optimal chemically defined media developed in this study (ZMB1 and ZMB2) were generally 3.5- to 4-fold higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the previously described best synthetic media (SA) and 50% to 68% higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with M17, a complex medium commonly used for lactococci. The new chemically defined media support high-cell-density growth of numerous strains of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Maturing dynamics of surface microflora in Fontina PDO cheese studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  - AIMS: To study the evolution of rind microbial communities in Fontina PDO cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four batches were examined for their surface microflora during ripening, carried out in two different maturing caves, at Ollomont and Pre-Saint-Didier, Aosta Valley region, Northwest of Italy. Culture-dependent methodologies were combined with culture-independent analysis (PCR-DGGE). Yeasts were found to increase from 10(3) to 10(6) CFU cm(-2) in 28 days, with consequent rise of surface pH, which allowed the growth of salt-tolerant bacteria, in particular coryneforms which reached 10(9) CFU cm(-2) at the end of 3 months. Coagulase-negative cocci and lactic acid bacteria reached 10(7) CFU cm(-2) in the same period. Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida sake were the species more constantly present throughout the whole maturing process. As early as after 1 day since manufacture, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were detected on cheese rinds. Arthrobacter nicotianae, Brevibacterium casei and Corynebacterium glutamicum were found after 7-28 days. CONCLUSIONS: According to cluster analysis of DGGE profiles, the maturing environment seemed to influence the dynamics of microbial groups on Fontina surfaces. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results represent a first picture of micro-organisms colonizing Fontina PDO rinds. Further studies are in progress to better understand the origin of this surface microflora and to formulate surface starters.
TI  - Comparison of the local immune response against Giardia lamblia cyst wall protein 2 induced by recombinant Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii are lactic acid bacteria (LAB) currently being advocated for use as live antigen delivery vehicles to mucosal sites. Since both vehicles differ in their capability to persist within the small intestine and in their mode of antigen delivery, we sought to compare them to determine which one was superior. In this study, we compared the efficacy of recombinant L. lactis and S. gordonii to stimulate intestinal immune responses against Giardia lamblia cyst wall protein-2 in BALB/c mice. Oral administration of either vector significantly increased the number of CD4(+) T helper and B-cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and Peyer's patches (PP) of immunized animals. Delivery of recombinant CWP2 (rCWP2) by L. lactis stimulated a balanced IFN-gamma/IL-4 response (MLN and PP cells) and a CWP2-specific intestinal IgA antibody response. Alternatively, delivery of rCWP2 by S. gordonii stimulated a higher frequency of IFN-gamma secreting MLN and PP cells, as well as doubling the amount of CWP2-specific intestinal IgA. In challenge studies, L. lactis and S. gordonii reduced cyst output by 71 and 90%, respectively. When compared to each other, S. gordonii-immunized animals shed 65% fewer cysts than their L. lactis-immunized counterparts. Based on these findings, we concluded that S. gordonii was superior to L. lactis as an intestinal vaccine delivery vehicle.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Lactococcus lactis confers protection against  respiratory pneumococcal infection.
AB  - In the present work, we evaluated if oral immunization with the pneumococcal protective protein A (PppA), expressed in the cell wall of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis PppA+), was able to confer protective immunity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mice were immunized orally with L. lactis PppA+ for 5 consecutive days. Vaccination was performed one (nonboosted group) or 2 times with a 2 week interval between each immunization (boosted group). Oral priming with L. lactis PppA+ induced the production of anti-PppA IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies in serum and in bronchoalveolar (BAL) and intestinal (IF) lavage fluids. Boosting with L. lactis PppA+ increased the levels of mucosal and systemic immunoglobulins. Moreover, the avidity and the opsonophagocytic activity of anti-PppA antibodies were significantly improved in the boosted group. The presence of both IgG1 and IgG2a anti-PppA antibodies in serum and BAL and the production of both interferon gamma and interleukin-4 by spleen cells from immunized mice indicated that L. lactis PppA+ stimulated a mixture of Th1 and Th2 responses. The ability of L. lactis PppA+ to confer cross-protective immunity was evaluated using challenge assays with serotypes 3, 6B, 14, and 23F. Lung bacterial cell counts and hemocultures showed that immunization with L. lactis PppA+ improved resistance against all the serotypes assessed, including serotype 3, which was highly virulent in our experimental animal model. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of protection against respiratory pneumococcal infection induced by oral administration of a recombinant lactococcal vaccine.
TI  - Short communication: impact of pH and temperature on the acidifying activity of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum.
AB  - The acidifying activity of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum LMA28, a strain isolated from French soft cheese, was studied in trypticase soy broth with yeast extract (TSB-YE) medium and in milk. In TSB-YE supplemented with lactose, glucose, or galactose, lactose and glucose were metabolized with a maximum growth rate of 0.32 h(-1) and galactose was not metabolized. During hydrolysis of lactose, the galactose moiety was not excreted. The major product was l(+) lactic acid, with no significant difference in the lactic acid yield. Glucose was not completely metabolized because cell growth stopped when pH values reached an average of 5.0. In sterilized UHT milk, the addition of 1 g/L of YE enhanced its coagulation. Compared with commercial starter lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis DSMZ 20481 or Streptococcus thermophilus INRA 302, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum LMA 28 was shown to be a slow acidifying strain. However, in spite of this weak acidifying ability, C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 can sustain low pH values in coculture with Lc. lactis DSMZ 20481 or S. thermophilus INRA 302. The individual and interactive effects of initial pH values (5.2 to 8.0) and incubation temperatures (23 to 37 degrees C) on acidifying activity were studied by response surface methodology. The 3 strains displayed different behaviors depending on pH and temperature. The psychrotrophic lactic acid strain C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 was able to grow at alkaline pH values and during storage conditions. It could be used as a potential ripening flora in soft cheese.
TI  - Potentially probiotic bacteria induce efficient maturation but differential cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the ability of nine different potentially probiotic bacteria to induce maturation and cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). METHODS: Cytokine production and maturation of moDCs in response to bacterial stimulation was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometric analysis (FACS), respectively. The kinetics of mRNA expression of cytokine genes was determined by Northern blotting. The involvement of different signaling pathways in cytokine gene expression was studied using specific pharmacological signaling inhibitors. RESULTS: All studied bacteria induced the maturation of moDCs in a dose-dependent manner. More detailed analysis with S. thermophilus THS, B. breve Bb99, and L. lactis subsp. cremoris ARH74 indicated that these bacteria induced the expression of moDC maturation markers HLA class II and CD86 as efficiently as pathogenic bacteria. However, these bacteria differed in their ability to induce moDC cytokine gene expression. S. thermophilus induced the expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-6, and CCL20) and Th1 type (IL-12 and IFN-gamma) cytokines, while B. breve and L. lactis were also potent inducers of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways were shown to be involved in bacteria-induced cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that potentially probiotic bacteria are able to induce moDC maturation, but their ability to induce cytokine gene expression varies significantly from one bacterial strain to another.
TI  - Stimulation of respiratory immunity by oral administration of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - This work demonstrates that non-recombinant Lactococcus lactis NZ, administered by the oral route at the proper dose, is able to improve resistance against pneumococcal infection. Lactococcus lactis NZ oral administration was able to improve pathogen lung clearance, increased survival of infected mice, and reduced lung injuries. This effect was related to an upregulation of the respiratory innate and specific immune responses. Administration of L. lactis NZ improved production of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid TNF-alpha, enhanced recruitment of neutrophils into the alveolar spaces, and induced a higher activation of BAL phagocytes compared with the control group. Lactococcus lactis NZ administered orally stimulated the IgA cycle, increased IgA+ cells in intestine and bronchus, and improved production of BAL IL-4 and IL-10 during infection. Moreover, mice treated with L. lactis NZ showed higher levels of BAL anti-pneumococcal IgA and IgG. Taking into consideration that orally administered L. lactis NZ stimulates both the innate and the specific immune responses in the respiratory tract and that bacterial and viral antigens have been efficiently produced in this strain, L. lactis NZ is an excellent candidate for the development of an effective pneumococcal oral vaccine.
TI  - Shr is a broad-spectrum surface receptor that contributes to adherence and virulence in group A streptococcus.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a common hemolytic pathogen that produces a range  of suppurative infections and autoimmune sequelae in humans. Shr is an exported protein in GAS, which binds in vitro to hemoglobin, myoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex. We previously reported that Shr is found in association with whole GAS cells and in culture supernatant. Here, we demonstrate that cell-associated Shr could not be released from the bacteria by the muralytic enzyme mutanolysin and was instead localized to the membrane. Shr was available, however, on the exterior of GAS, exposed to the extracellular environment. In vitro binding and competition assays demonstrated that in addition to hemoprotein binding, purified Shr specifically interacts with immobilized fibronectin and laminin. The absence of typical fibronectin-binding motifs indicates that a new protein pattern is involved in the binding of Shr to the extracellular matrix. Recombinant Lactococcus lactis cells expressing Shr on the bacterial surface gained the ability to bind to immobilized fibronectin, suggesting that Shr can function as an adhesin. The inactivation of shr resulted in a 40% reduction in the attachment to human epithelial cells in comparison to the parent strain. GAS infection elicited a high titer of Shr antibodies in sera from convalescent mice, demonstrating that Shr is expressed in vivo. The shr mutant was attenuated for virulence in an intramuscular zebrafish model system. In summary, this study identifies Shr as being a new microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules in GAS that mediates attachment to epithelial cells and contributes to the infection process.
TI  - Nasal administration of Lactococcus lactis improves local and systemic immune responses against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 is a non-pathogenic non-invasive bacterium extensively  used for the delivery of antigens and cytokines at the mucosal level. However, there are no reports concerning the per se immunomodulatory capacity of this strain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the intrinsic immunostimulating properties of the nasal administration of L. lactis NZ9000 in a pneumococcal infection model. Mice were preventively treated with L. lactis (2, 5 or 7 days with 10(8) cells/day per mouse) and then challenged with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The local and the systemic immune responses were evaluated. Our results showed that nasal administration of L. lactis for 5 days (LLN5d) increased the clearance rate of S. pneumoniae from lung and prevented the dissemination of pneumococci into blood. This effect coincided with an upregulation of the innate and specific immune responses in both local and systemic compartments. LLN5d increased phagocyte activation in lung, blood and bone marrow, determined by NBT and peroxidase tests. Anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin (Ig)A in bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and IgG in BAL and serum were increased in the LLN5d group. Lung tissue injury was reduced by LLN5d treatment as revealed by histopathological examination and albumin concentration and lactate dehydrogenase activity in BAL. The adjuvant effect of L. lactis in our infection model would be an important advantage for its use as a delivery vehicle of pneumococcal proteins and nasal immunization with recombinant L. lactis emerges as an effective route of vaccination for both systemic and mucosal immunity against pneumococcal infection.
TI  - Polyphasic approach to bacterial dynamics during the ripening of Spanish farmhouse cheese, using culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  - We studied the dynamics of the microbial population during ripening of Cueva de la Magaha cheese using a combination of classical and molecular techniques. Samples taken during ripening of this Spanish goat's milk cheese in which Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures were analyzed. All bacterial isolates were clustered by using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, species-specific PCR, and multiplex PCR. Our results indicate that the majority of the 225 strains isolated and enumerated on solid media during the ripening period were nonstarter lactic acid bacteria, and Lactobacillus paracasei was the most abundant species. Other Lactobacillus species, such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri, were also detected at the beginning and end of ripening, respectively. Non-lactic-acid bacteria, mainly Kocuria and Staphylococcus strains, were also detected at the end of the ripening period. Microbial community dynamics determined by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise estimate of the distribution of bacteria and enabled us to detect Lactobacillus curvatus and the starter bacteria S. thermophilus and L. lactis, which were not isolated. Surprisingly, the bacterium most frequently found using culture-dependent analysis, L. paracasei, was scarcely detected by this molecular approach. Finally, we studied the composition of the lactobacilli and their evolution by using length heterogeneity PCR.
TI  - Expression of the Streptococcus agalactiae virulence-associated protease CspA in  a soluble, active form utilizing the Gram-positive host, Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The heterologous expression of streptococcal genes in common Gram-negative hosts  may be complicated by low-level expression, toxicity to the host, formation of inclusion bodies, and mislocalization of the encoded proteins. Biochemical study of the Streptococcus agalactiae virulence-associated cell-envelope protease (CEP) CspA, as well as other CEPs, has been limited by the lack of effective expression systems. In this study, we present a simple strategy to express cspA as a catalytically active exoprotein. A recombinant allele of cspA, cspADeltaCWA, was engineered to eliminate the dispensable cell-wall anchor. The cspADeltaCWA allele was expressed in the Gram-positive organism, Lactococcus lactis, using an established, plasmid-based, nisin-inducible expression system. After induction, nearly all of the exoprotein observable by SDS-PAGE corresponded to CspADeltaCWA. CspADeltaCWA-containing medium exhibited similar fibrinolytic activity as whole cells of GBS, indicating the recombinant protein was active. Characterization of CspADeltaCWA indicated that like some other CEPs, it is N-terminally processed, exists predominantly as a dimer, and has the ability to cleave itself at its C-terminus. Taken together, this work presents an efficient strategy for expression of cspA that could be applied to other streptococcal proteins that are not amenable to expression using common Gram-negative hosts.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. Several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. METHODS: Salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. RESULTS: Probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of S. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of S. gordonii was weaker. Salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. The modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of S. mutans but not of S. gordonii. Two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. All bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. The ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. CONCLUSION: This in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.
TI  - New strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  - The C-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (CPH) of Lactococcus lactis  IL1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (SBD) of the *-amylase of Streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein (CPH-SBD) was able to bind to the cell surface of Lactobacillus casei NRRL B-441 and to corn starch. Therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. At a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, CPH-SBD-displaying L. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of L. casei did not form any aggregates with corn starch. After incubation in simulated gastric juice (pH 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. When CPH-SBD-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. The survival of the amylose-coated CPH-SBD-displaying L. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of CPH-SBD-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.
TI  - Microflora of Feta cheese from four Greek manufacturers.
AB  - The components of the microflora of four Feta cheeses, produced by different Greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. Isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and then representatives of each DGGE group were sequenced for identification purposes. DNA and RNA, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to PCR-DGGE. Moreover, Feta cheeses were subjected to FISH analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. The microbial ecology, as represented by the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. The main LAB species isolated were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis and Lactobacillus fermentum. However, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. In the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by PCR-DGGE compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia fermentans and C. zeylanoides. FISH analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus spp. RAPD-PCR performed on the L. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.
TI  - Fate and effects of Camembert cheese micro-organisms in the human colonic microbiota of healthy volunteers after regular Camembert consumption.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine i) if Camembert cheese micro-organisms could be detected in fecal samples after regular consumption by human subjects and ii) the consequence of this consumption on global metabolic activities of the host colonic microbiota. An open human protocol was designed where 12 healthy volunteers were included: a 2-week period of fermented products exclusion followed by a 4-weeks Camembert ingestion period where 2x40 g/day of Camembert cheese was consumed. Stools were collected from the volunteers before consumption, twice during the ingestion period (2nd and 4th week) and once after a wash out period of 2 weeks. During the consumption of Camembert cheese, high levels of Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were measured in fecal samples using real-time quantitative PCR, reaching median values of 8.2 and 7.5 Log(10) genome equivalents/g of stool. For Ln. mesenteroides, persistence was observed 15 days after the end of Camembert consumption. The survival of Geotrichum candidum was also assessed and the fecal concentration reached a median level of 7.1 Log(10) CFU/g in stools. Except a decreasing trend of the nitrate reductase activity, no significant modification was shown in the metabolic activities during this study.
TI  - Morphology, genome sequence, and structural proteome of type phage P335 from Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis phage P335 is a virulent type phage for the species that bears its name and belongs to the Siphoviridae family. Morphologically, P335 resembled the L. lactis phages TP901-1 and Tuc2009, except for a shorter tail and a different collar/whisker structure. Its 33,613-bp double-stranded DNA genome had 50 open reading frames. Putative functions were assigned to 29 of them. Unlike other sequenced genomes from lactococcal phages belonging to this species, P335 did not have a lysogeny module. However, it did carry a dUTPase gene, the most conserved gene among this phage species. Comparative genomic analyses revealed a high level of identity between the morphogenesis modules of the phages P335, ul36, TP901-1, and Tuc2009 and two putative prophages of L. lactis SK11. Differences were noted in genes coding for receptor-binding proteins, in agreement with their distinct host ranges. Sixteen structural proteins of phage P335 were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A 2.8-kb insertion was recognized between the putative genes coding for the activator of late transcription (Alt) and the small terminase subunit (TerS). Four genes within this region were autonomously late transcribed and possibly under the control of Alt. Three of the four deduced proteins had similarities with proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes prophages, suggesting that P335 acquired this module from another phage genome. The genetic diversity of the P335 species indicates that they are exceptional models for studying the modular theory of phage evolution.
TI  - Short-term relative antibacterial effect of octenidine dihydrochloride on the oral microflora in orthodontically treated patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT). METHODS: The antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. After unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. Saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. RESULTS: OCT had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (PVP-I) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). The antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% CHX on total bacteria and Lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% PVP-I mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 0.5mg/ml CHX, and 0.1mg/ml OCT concentrations, while Streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 2mg/ml CHX, and 0.8mg/ml OCT concentrations. Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml OCT, 30mg/ml PVP-I, and 0.0063mg/ml CHX concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: OCT compared favorably with CHX and PVP-I in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).
TI  - Microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese.
AB  - The microbial diversity of sixty-three Natural Whey Cultures (NWCs) for the manufacture of Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO was studied. The NWCs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of PDO production including five different regions of southern Italy. The microbial species diversity was determined by direct DNA extraction from NWCs and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). DGGE and DHPLC fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. The DHPLC technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as DGGE in profiling species diversity in NWCs. Cluster analysis of DGGE and DHPLC data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the NWCs. The presence of three groups of 10-14 NWCs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the NWCs for Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO. A RAPD-PCR analysis of the NWCs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical NWCs included different biotypes. The sequences of DGGE bands and DHPLC peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic Lactococcus lactis also occurred in some NWCs. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of NWCs used for the Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. The microbiota of fermented PDO products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.
TI  - Scavenger receptor gp340 aggregates group A streptococci by binding pili.
AB  - Group A streptococci (GAS) are the most frequent cause of bacterial pharyngitis.  The first obstacle to GAS colonization of the pharynx is saliva. As well as forming a physical barrier, saliva contains components of innate and acquired immunity. Previous work has shown that saliva induces bacterial aggregation, which may serve as a clearance mechanism. As the aggregation of some oral streptococci in saliva is mediated by long proteinaceous appendages, we hypothesized that pili of GAS might behave similarly. Wild-type GAS M1 strain SF370 aggregated in saliva, while pilus-defective mutants did not. Similarly, heterologous expression of diverse GAS pili on the surface of Lactococcus lactis induced aggregation in saliva, while control strains were unaffected. Further studies revealed that aggregating bacteria bound salivary component gp340. Purified gp340 aggregated wild-type GAS and L. lactis expressing GAS pili, but not control strains. GAS pilus-defective mutants were abrogated in gp340 binding and aggregation. Furthermore, gp340-mediated aggregation reduced bacterial adhesion to human epithelial cells, suggesting a role in host defence.
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - Nasal immunization with Lactococcus lactis expressing the pneumococcal protective protein A induces protective immunity in mice.
AB  - Nisin-controlled gene expression was used to develop a recombinant strain of Lactococcus lactis that is able to express the pneumococcal protective protein A (PppA) on its surface. Immunodetection assays confirmed that after the induction with nisin, the PppA antigen was predictably and efficiently displayed on the cell surface of the recombinant strain, which was termed L. lactis PppA. The production of mucosal and systemically specific antibodies in adult and young mice was evaluated after mice were nasally immunized with L. lactis PppA. Immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA anti-PppA antibodies were detected in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of adult and young mice, which showed that PppA expressed in L. lactis was able to induce a strong mucosal and systemic immune response. Challenge survival experiments demonstrated that immunization with L. lactis PppA was able to increase resistance to systemic and respiratory infection with different pneumococcal serotypes, and passive immunization assays of naive young mice demonstrated a direct correlation between anti-PppA antibodies and protection. The results presented in this study demonstrate three major characteristics of the effectiveness of nasal immunization with PppA expressed as a protein anchored to the cell wall of L. lactis: it elicited cross-protective immunity against different pneumococcal serotypes, it afforded protection against both systemic and respiratory challenges, and it induced protective immunity in mice of different ages.
TI  - Characterization and genomic analysis of phage asccphi28, a phage of the family Podoviridae infecting Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Bacteriophage asccphi28 infects dairy fermentation strains of Lactococcus lactis. This report describes characterization of asccphi28 and its full genome sequence. Phage asccphi28 has a prolate head, whiskers, and a short tail (C2 morphotype). This morphology and DNA hybridization to L. lactis phage P369 DNA showed that asccphi28 belongs to the P034 phage species, a group rarely encountered in the dairy industry. The burst size of asccphi28 was found to be 121 +/- 18 PFU per infected bacterial cell after a latent period of 44 min. The linear genome (18,762 bp) contains 28 possible open reading frames (ORFs) comprising 90% of the total genome. The ORFs are arranged bidirectionally in recognizable functional modules. The genome contains 577 bp inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and putatively eight promoters and four terminators. The presence of ITRs, a phage-encoded DNA polymerase, and a terminal protein that binds to the DNA, along with BLAST and morphology data, show that asccphi28 more closely resembles streptococcal phage Cp-1 and the phi29-like phages that infect Bacillus subtilis than it resembles common lactococcal phages. The sequence of this phage is the first published sequence of a P034 species phage genome.
TI  - Bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of C-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis IL1403.
AB  - With the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (LABs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the C-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (CPH) of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was studied. CPH fused to the alpha-amylase (AMY) of Streptococcus bovis 148 either at its C-terminus (CPH-AMY) or at its N-terminus (AMY-CPH) was expressed intracellularly in Escherichia coli. This domain was able to direct binding of AMY to the surface of L. lactis ATCC 19435 in both constructs. However, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of CPH-AMY were 3 and 14 times greater than those in the case of AMY-CPH, respectively. Of the LABs tested, L. lactis ATCC 19435 showed the highest binding capability for CPH-AMY, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). The binding of CPH-AMY to the surface of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). The production of CPH-AMY in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. The results of this study suggest the usefulness of CPH as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in E. coli. Furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of CPH in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.
TI  - Effect of wild strains used as starter cultures and adjunct cultures on the volatile compounds of the Pecorino Siciliano cheese.
AB  - The effect of six wild strains on the volatile profile of the PS cheese was investigated and compared to that generated from industrial starters generally used to produce PS cheese. All cheeses were subjected to microbiological, physicochemical, and volatile compounds analyses. The DGGE of the 16S rDNA analysis was also applied. The volatile compounds generated during ripening were studied through the SPME and the GC-MS methods. No difference was detected between the experimental and control cheeses throughout chemical and microbiological analyses, while the DGGE results showed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus in all cheeses, and the dominance of Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus casei in most of the experimental cheeses. Moreover, the presence of Lactococcus lactis species as in the control and in the experimental P2 and P4 cheeses was also revealed. The SPME results showed more pronounced volatile compounds in the experimental cheese samples than in the control ones.
TI  - [Gene regulation to lactic acid bacteria for increasing production of flavor metabolite].
AB  - Abstract: The major flavor substances Lactic acid bacteria produced include the buttermilk aroma butanedione, the yoghurt flavor acetaldehyde and the amino acid. Metabolic engineering in LAB had focused primarily on rerouting of pyruvate metabolism towards butanedione or acetaldehyde to improve the flavor of fermented milk, which has considerable economic value. The typical yogurt flavor is caused by acetaldehyde produced through many different pathways. The attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which encoded by the glyA gene. In addition, the efficient conversion of glucose into acetaldehyde was achieved by over-expression of pyruvate decarboxylase and NADH oxidase in LAB. The concentration of acetaldehyde derived from this regulation is higher than the other strategy. As for the regulation of butanedione, it was focused on combinating inactivation of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase with low lactate dehydrogenase activity, or with overproduction of NADH-oxidase, or with overproduction of alpha-acetolactate synthase. Then the possibility of co-regulation with certain three kinds of enzyme above was recommended.
TI  - Plasmid transfer via transduction from Streptococcus thermophilus to Lactococcus  lactis.
AB  - Using Streptococcus thermophilus phages, plasmid transduction in Lactococcus lactis was demonstrated. The transduction frequencies were 4 orders of magnitude lower in L. lactis than in S. thermophilus. These results are the first evidence that there is phage-mediated direct transfer of DNA from S. thermophilus to L. lactis. The implications of these results for phage evolution are discussed.
TI  - A group B streptococcal pilus protein promotes phagocyte resistance and systemic  virulence.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of invasive bacterial infections in  newborns and certain adult populations. Surface filamentous appendages known as pili have been recently identified in GBS. However, little is known about the role of these structures in disease pathogenesis. In this study we sought to probe potential functional role(s) of PilB, the major GBS pilus protein subunit, by coupling analysis of an isogenic GBS pilB knockout strain with heterologous expression of the pilB gene in the nonpathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. We found the knockout GBS strain that lacked PilB was more susceptible than wild-type (WT) GBS to killing by isolated macrophages and neutrophils. Survival was linked to the ability of PilB to mediate GBS resistance to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, the PilB-deficient GBS mutant was more readily cleared from the mouse bloodstream and less-virulent in vivo compared to the WT parent strain. Strikingly, overexpression of the pilB gene alone in L. lactis enhanced resistance to phagocyte killing, increased bloodstream survival, and conferred virulence in a mouse challenge model. Together these data demonstrate that the pilus backbone subunit, PilB, plays an integral role in GBS virulence and suggests a novel role for gram-positive pili in thwarting the innate defenses of phagocyte killing.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis produces short-chain quinones that cross-feed Group B Streptococcus to activate respiration growth.
AB  - Quinones are essential components of the respiration chain that shuttle electrons between oxidoreductases. We characterized the quinones synthesized by Lactococcus lactis, a fermenting bacterium that activates aerobic respiration when a haem source is provided. Two distinct subgroups were characterized: Menaquinones (MK) MK-8 to MK-10, considered as hallmarks of L. lactis, are produced throughout growth. MK-3 and demethylMK-3 [(D)MK-3] are newly identified and are present only late in growth. Production of (D)MK-3 was conditional on the carbon sugar and on the presence of carbon catabolite regulator gene ccpA. Electron flux driven by both (D)MK fractions was shared between the quinol oxidase and extracellular acceptors O(2), iron and, with remarkable efficiency, copper. Purified (D)MK-3, but not MK-8-10, complemented a menB defect in L. lactis. We previously showed that a respiratory metabolism is activated in Group B Streptococcus (GBS) by exogenous haem and MK, and that this activity is implicated in virulence. Here we show that growing lactococci donate (D)MK to GBS to activate respiration and stimulate growth of this opportunist pathogen. We propose that conditions favouring (D)MK production in dense microbial ecosystems, as present in the intestinal tract, could favour implantation of (D)MK-scavengers like GBS within the complex.
TI  - The inhibitory spectrum of thermophilin 9 from Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 depends on the production of multiple peptides and the activity of BlpG(St), a thiol-disulfide oxidase.
AB  - The blp(St) cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9 was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of bacteriocins active against other S. thermophilus strains. In this study, we further investigated the antimicrobial activity of S. thermophilus LMD-9 by testing the susceptibility of 31 bacterial species (87 strains). We showed that LMD-9 displays an inhibitory spectrum targeted toward related gram-positive bacteria, including pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. Using deletion mutants, we investigated the contribution of the three putative bacteriocin-encoding operons blpD(St)-orf2, blpU(St)-orf3, and blpE(St)-blpF(St) (bac(St) operons) and of the blpG(St) gene, which encodes a putative modification protein, to the inhibitory spectrum and immunity of strain LMD-9. Our results present evidence that the blp(St) locus encodes a multipeptide bacteriocin system called thermophilin 9. Among the four class II bacteriocin-like peptides encoded within the bac(St) operons, BlpD(St) alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most thermophilin 9-sensitive species. The blpD(St) gene forms an operon with its associated immunity gene(s), and this functional bacteriocin/immunity module could easily be transferred to Lactococcus lactis. The remaining three Bac(St) peptides, BlpU(St), BlpE(St), and BlpF(St), confer poor antimicrobial activity but act as enhancers of the antagonistic activity of thermophilin 9 by an unknown mechanism. The blpG(St) gene was also shown to be specifically required for the antilisteria activity of thermophilin 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most Listeria species. By complementation of the motility deficiency of Escherichia coli dsbA, we showed that blpG(St) encodes a functional thiol-disulfide oxidase, suggesting an important role for disulfide bridges within thermophilin 9.
TI  - System using tandem repeats of the cA peptidoglycan-binding domain from Lactococcus lactis for display of both N- and C-terminal fusions on cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the C terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (cA domain) of AcmA (a major autolysin from Lactococcus lactis). Western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (cA-AmyA) of the cA domain and alpha-amylase from Streptococcus bovis 148 (AmyA) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of L. lactis cells. AmyA was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. Moreover, with an increase in the number of cA domains, the quantity of cA-AmyA fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. When three repeats of the cA domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. The raw starch-degrading activity of AmyA was significantly higher when AmyA was fused to the C terminus of the cA domain than when it was fused to the N terminus. In addition, cA-AmyA fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Method for reliable isolation of Lactobacillus sakei strains originating from Tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  - In Tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. Such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. We isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of Tunisia, and selectively searched for Lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. Eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. Several methods were used in order to develop a rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of L. sakei. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. Search for the presence of the L. sakei specific katA gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ARDRA group. Sequencing of 16S rDNA confirmed those isolates as L. sakei. Those 22 different L. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ARDRA groups were tentatively ascribed to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis/garviae, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus parauberis, Hafnia alvei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus curvatus through 16S rDNA sequencing. A fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate L. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.
TI  - Heterologous expression of the pneumococcal serotype 14 polysaccharide in Lactococcus lactis requires lactococcal epsABC regulatory genes.
AB  - The pneumococcal serotype 14 polysaccharide was produced in Lactococcus lactis by coexpressing pneumococcal polysaccharide type 14-specific genes (cpsFGHIJKL(14)) with the lactococcal regulatory and priming glucosyltransferase-encoding genes specific for B40 polysaccharide (epsABCD(B40)). The polysaccharide produced by Lactococcus was secreted in the medium, simplifying downstream processing and polysaccharide isolation from culture broth.
TI  - Bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk.
AB  - The aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional Zabady fermented milk using PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Most of the identified bacterial species in Zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), e.g., Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in Zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. The main dominant species was St. thermophilus followed by Lc. garvieae. Other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific PCR assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the TTGE and DGGE results. Lc. garvieae, Lc. raffinolactis, Ln. citreum, and Lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of Egyptian fermented milk.
TI  - CodY of Streptococcus pneumoniae: link between nutritional gene regulation and colonization.
AB  - CodY is a nutritional regulator mainly involved in amino acid metabolism. It has  been extensively studied in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis. We investigated the role of CodY in gene regulation and virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. We constructed a codY mutant and examined the effect on gene and protein expression by microarray and two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis analysis. The pneumococcal CodY regulon was found to consist predominantly of genes involved in amino acid metabolism but also several other cellular processes, such as carbon metabolism and iron uptake. By means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNA footprinting, we showed that most of the targets identified are under the direct control of CodY. By mutating DNA predicted to represent the CodY box based on the L. lactis consensus, we demonstrated that this sequence is indeed required for in vitro DNA binding to target promoters. Similar to L. lactis, DNA binding of CodY was enhanced in the presence of branched-chain amino acids, but not by GTP. We observed in experimental mouse models that codY is transcribed in the murine nasopharynx and lungs and is specifically required for colonization. This finding was underscored by the diminished ability of the codY mutant to adhere to nasopharyngeal cells in vitro. Furthermore, we found that pcpA, activated by CodY, is required for adherence to nasopharyngeal cells, suggesting a direct link between nutritional regulation and adherence. In conclusion, pneumococcal CodY predominantly regulates genes involved in amino acid metabolism and contributes to the early stages of infection, i.e., colonization of the nasopharynx.
TI  - Effect of a probiotic mixed culture on texture profile and sensory performance of Minas fresh cheese in comparison with the traditional products.
AB  - The effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of Minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. Three cheese-making trials were prepared: T1, with the traditional type O starter culture (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + L. lactis subsp. cremoris), T2 with only lactic acid and T3, with lactic acid and the probiotic ABT culture (Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 + Bifidobacterium animalis Bb-12 + Streptococcus thermophilus). Instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. Lb. acidophilus and B. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses T3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the La-5 growth was observed. Cheeses with added probiotic ABT culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher pH values. Results indicated that the use of probiotic ABT culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type O (Lc. lactis subsp. lactis + Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for Minas cheese production, is advantageous.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Role of Streptococcus gordonii surface proteins SspA/SspB and Hsa in platelet function.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii colonization of damaged heart surfaces in infective endocarditis is dependent upon the recognition of host receptors by specific bacterial surface proteins. However, despite several attempts to identify the mechanisms involved in this interaction, the nature of the bacterial proteins required remains poorly understood. This study provides clear evidence that several S. gordonii surface proteins participate in the interaction with platelets to support platelet adhesion and induce platelet aggregation. S. gordonii strains were found to support strong (DL1-Challis, SK12, SK184, and Blackburn) or moderate (UB1545 delta hsa and CH1-Challis) adhesion or failed to support platelet adhesion (M5, M99, and Channon). In addition, under flow conditions, platelets rolled and subsequently adhered to immobilized S. gordonii at low shear (50 s(-1)) in an Hsa-dependent manner but did not interact with S. gordonii DL1 at any shear rate of >50 s(-1). S. gordonii strains either induced (DL1-Challis, SK12, SK184, UB1545 delta hsa, and M99) or failed to induce (M5, CH1-Challis, Channon, and Blackburn) platelet aggregation. Using a proteomic approach to identify differential cell wall protein expression between aggregating (DL1) and nonaggregating (Blackburn) strains, we identified antigen I/antigen II family proteins SspA and SspB. The overexpression of SspA or SspB in platelet-nonreactive Lactococcus lactis induced GPIIb/GPIIIa-dependent platelet aggregation similar to that seen with S. gordonii DL1. However, they failed to support platelet adhesion. Thus, S. gordonii has distinct mechanisms for supporting platelet adhesion and inducing platelet aggregation. Differential protein expression between strains may be important for the pathogenesis of invasive diseases such as infective endocarditis.
TI  - The extent of co-metabolism of glucose and galactose by Lactococcus lactis changes with the expression of the lacSZ operon from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The lactose transporter and beta-galactosidase from Streptococcus thermophilus, encoded by the lacSZ operon, were introduced into the lactose-negative strain Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and the expression of the lacSZ operon was modulated by substitution of the native promoter with randomized synthetic promoters. A series of strains with various expression levels of lacSZ were examined for their fermentation of lactose. Strains with a high expression level were found to metabolize lactose in a similar manner to S. thermophilus, i.e. the galactose moiety of lactose was excreted to the growth medium and only glucose was metabolized in glycolysis. Interestingly, strains with low expression of the operon showed a mixed acid metabolism and co-metabolism of galactose and glucose. The lactose flux increased gradually with increasing expression of the lacSZ operon until an optimum was observed at intermediate beta-galactosidase activities of 2000-3000 Miller units. At higher expression levels, the flux decreased. These strains had a glycolytic flux comparable with those of reference strains with the standard lactococcal PTS(lac) (lactose phosphotransferase transport system) lactose transporter, which indicates that lactose transport is not rate-limiting for glycolysis in Lactococcus. Finally, an additional ATP drain was introduced into the fastest growing strain, CS2004, to test whether the ATP demand controlled glycolysis under these conditions, but in fact no increase in glycolytic flux was observed.
TI  - Hyaluronic acid production by recombinant Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Microbial hyaluronic acid (HA), commonly produced by pathogenic Streptococcus, was made possible to be produced by a generally recognized as safe Lactococcus lactis by coexpressing HA synthase and uridine diphosphate-glucose dehydrogenase (UDP-GlcDH) of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus in a nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system. With scarce expressed HA synthase alone, the constructed recombinant L. lactis (LL-NA) strain could produce HA with a concentration about 0.08 g/l in the M17 medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose. In contrast to HA synthase, UDP-GlcDH of Streptococcus could be overexpressed in the NICE system. With coexpression of heterologous UDP-GlcDH with HA synthase, the constructed LL-NAB strain grew slightly slower to a concentration about 10% lower that of the LL-NA strain. However, the HA concentration produced was enhanced about eightfold to 0.65 g/l.
TI  - Characterization and structure analysis of a novel bacteriocin, lacticin Z, produced by Lactococcus lactis QU 14.
AB  - A novel bacteriocin, lacticin Z, produced by Lactococcus lactis QU 14 isolated from a horse's intestinal tract was identified. Lacticin Z was purified through a three step procedure comprised of hydrophobic-interaction, cation-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase HPLC. ESI-TOF MS determined the molecular mass of lacticin Z to be 5,968.9 Da. The primary structure of lacticin Z was found to consist of 53 amino acid residues without any leader sequence or signal peptide. Lacticin Z showed homology to lacticin Q from L. lactis QU 5, aureocin A53 from Staphylococcus aureus A53, and mutacin BHT-B from Streptococcus rattus strain BHT. It exhibited a nanomolar range of MICs against various Gram-positive bacteria, and the activity was completely stable up to 100 degrees C. Unlike many of other LAB bacteriocins, the stability of lacticin Z was emphasized under alkaline conditions rather than acidic conditions. All the results indicated that lacticin Z belongs to a novel type of bacteriocin.
TI  - Efficacy of nisin in treatment of clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - Nisin is an antimicrobial polypeptide produced by Lactococcus lactis and is believed nontoxic to humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate a nisin-based formulation for the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cattle. A total of 92 cows with 107 clinically mastitic quarters were randomly assigned to nisin- (48 cows with 51 quarters) and gentamicin (GM)-treated (44 cows with 56 quarters) groups. In the nisin-treated group, cows received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 IU; in the GM-treated group, intramammary infusion of GM was administered at a dose of 0.8 g. Results indicated that nisin offered a clinical cure rate similar to GM (90.2 vs. 91.1%) and no difference in bacteriological cure rate than GM-treated group (60.8 vs. 44.6%, respectively). Proportion of the quarters with milk somatic cell counts <500,000 cells/mL was not different in the nisin-treated group (50.0 and 47.8%) compared with the GM-treated group (33.3 and 37.3%) 1 and 2 wk after treatment. Of 17 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 82.5% were resistant to penicillin, and 35.3% to GM, but none of them to nisin. Nisin therapy eliminated 54.5% (6 of 11) of S. aureus IMI, whereas GM eliminated 33.3% (2 of 6). Nisin in milk (4.5 +/- 0.8 IU/mL) was detected only at 12 h following intramammary infusion, which was much lower than the upper limit (500 mg/mL) allowed as preservative in milk by the China authority. Because of its efficacy in the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis, especially resistant Staph. aureus-caused IMI, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different mastitis pathogens on a larger scale.
TI  - The unconventional Xer recombination machinery of Streptococci/Lactococci.
AB  - Homologous recombination between circular sister chromosomes during DNA replication in bacteria can generate chromosome dimers that must be resolved into monomers prior to cell division. In Escherichia coli, dimer resolution is achieved by site-specific recombination, Xer recombination, involving two paralogous tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, and a 28-bp recombination site (dif) located at the junction of the two replication arms. Xer recombination is tightly controlled by the septal protein FtsK. XerCD recombinases and FtsK are found on most sequenced eubacterial genomes, suggesting that the Xer recombination system as described in E. coli is highly conserved among prokaryotes. We show here that Streptococci and Lactococci carry an alternative Xer recombination machinery, organized in a single recombination module. This corresponds to an atypical 31-bp recombination site (dif(SL)) associated with a dedicated tyrosine recombinase (XerS). In contrast to the E. coli Xer system, only a single recombinase is required to recombine dif(SL), suggesting a different mechanism in the recombination process. Despite this important difference, XerS can only perform efficient recombination when dif(SL) sites are located on chromosome dimers. Moreover, the XerS/dif(SL) recombination requires the streptococcal protein FtsK(SL), probably without the need for direct protein-protein interaction, which we demonstrated to be located at the division septum of Lactococcus lactis. Acquisition of the XerS recombination module can be considered as a landmark of the separation of Streptococci/Lactococci from other firmicutes and support the view that Xer recombination is a conserved cellular function in bacteria, but that can be achieved by functional analogs.
TI  - Optimization of conditions for profiling bacterial populations in food by culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study we used culture-independent methods to profile bacterial populations in food products. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed in order to identify bacterial species without the need of isolation and biochemical identification. The protocols used to extract the DNA, subsequently subjected to PCR amplification for DGGE, as well as the hybridization procedure for FISH, were optimised. Moreover, an extensive study on the primers and probes to be used for the direct detection and identification of microorganisms commonly found in food, was carried out. Meat and cheese samples, fresh or processed, were subjected to DGGE and FISH analysis and the results obtained highlighted how the processing in food industry is decreasing the bacterial biodiversity. Not only processed cheese or meat but also fermented products were dominated by only one or few species. Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Brochothrix thermosphacta were the main species found in meat products, while in cheese(s) Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc spp. were repeatedly detected. The results obtained by the two culture-independent methods used always correlated well.
TI  - Innate immunity glycoprotein gp-340 variants may modulate human susceptibility to dental caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial adhesion is an important determinant of colonization and infection, including dental caries. The salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich glycoprotein gp-340, which mediates adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (implicated in caries), harbours three major size variants, designated gp-340 I to III, each specific to an individual saliva. Here we have examined the association of the gp-340 I to III polymorphisms with caries experience and adhesion of S. mutans. METHODS: A case-referent study was performed in 12-year-old Swedish children with high (n = 19) or low (n = 19) caries experiences. We measured the gp-340 I to III saliva phenotypes and correlated those with multiple outcome measures for caries experience and saliva adhesion of S. mutans using the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate projection technique. In addition, we used traditional statistics and 2-year caries increment to verify the established PLS associations, and bacterial adhesion to purified gp-340 I to III proteins to support possible mechanisms. RESULTS: All except one subject were typed as gp-340 I to III (10, 23 and 4, respectively). The gp-340 I phenotype correlated positively with caries experience (VIP = 1.37) and saliva adhesion of S. mutans Ingbritt (VIP = 1.47). The gp-340 II and III phenotypes tended to behave in the opposite way. Moreover, the gp-340 I phenotype tended to show an increased 2-year caries increment compared to phenotypes II/III. Purified gp-340 I protein mediated markedly higher adhesion of S. mutans strains Ingbritt and NG8 and Lactococcus lactis expressing AgI/II adhesins (SpaP or PAc) compared to gp-340 II and III proteins. In addition, the gp-340 I protein appeared over represented in subjects positive for Db, an allelic acidic PRP variant associated with caries, and subjects positive for both gp-340 I and Db tended to experience more caries than those negative for both proteins. CONCLUSION: Gp-340 I behaves as a caries susceptibility protein.
TI  - Comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from Lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  - While plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with Lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. In this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pDOJ1, from a strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. It consisted of a circular DNA molecule of 6,220 bp with a G+C content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (ORFs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (Mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. Comparative analysis of pDOJ1 and the other available L. delbrueckii plasmids (pLBB1, pJBL2, pN42, and pLL1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted ORFs from pDOJ1, reflecting a common origin for L. delbrueckii plasmids. Analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group B plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus. This observation and the ability of the replicon to function in S. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in L. delbrueckii was likely from S. thermophilus. This may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. As no vector based on plasmid replicons from L. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an Escherichia coli-L. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pDOJ4, was constructed from pDOJ1, the p15A ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pCI372, and the lacZ polylinker from pUC18. This cloning vector was successfully introduced into E. coli, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. This shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the mobilizable lactococcal plasmid pGdh442 encoding glutamate dehydrogenase activity.
AB  - A novel plasmid named pGdh442 had previously been isolated from a plant Lactococcus lactis strain. This plasmid encodes two interesting properties with applications in the dairy industry: a glutamate dehydrogenase activity that stimulates amino acid conversion to aroma compounds, and cadmium/zinc resistance that can be used as a selectable marker. Moreover, this plasmid can be transferred naturally to other strains, but appears to be incompatible with certain other lactococcal plasmids. During this study, the complete sequence of pGdh442 (68 319 bp) was determined and analysed. This plasmid contains 67 ORFs that include 20 IS elements that may have mediated transfer events between L. lactis and other genera living in the same biotope, such as Streptococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. Even though it is a low-copy-number plasmid, it is relatively stable due to a theta replication mode and the presence of two genes involved in its maintenance system. However, pGdh442 is incompatible with pSK08-derived protease/lactose plasmids because both possess the same replication and partition system. pGdh442 is not self-transmissible, but can be naturally transmitted via mobilization by conjugative elements carried by the chromosome or by other plasmids, such as the 712-type sex factor, which is widely distributed in L. lactis. In addition to several genes already found on other L. lactis plasmids, such as the oligopeptide transport and utilization genes, pGdh442 also carries several genes not yet identified in L. lactis. Finally, it does not carry genes that would trigger concern over its presence in human food.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from lakes.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from lake-water samples collected at 7 lakes distributed in Yamanashi prefecture, Japan. Sampling was performed year round. 112 cultures were isolated and divided into classes by phenotype and then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA. Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics identified eleven different bacterial groups (A to K), and the results showed that the isolates represented seven genera: Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Carnobacterium, Streptococcus, and Weissella. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the most abundant lactic acid bacteria found in these lakes. Furthermore, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also the most abundant lactic acid bacteria found throughout the year. Seasonal differences, numbers of isolates and the species of lactic acid bacteria were also recorded in this study.
TI  - Selection and properties of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient spontaneous mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria produce diacetyl, which is a desirable aroma compound in some fermented dairy products. Strains or mutants of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis that are deficient in alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase are used in some food processes for their ability to produce large amounts of diacetyl. However, up until now, the use of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of Streptococcus thermophilus for increased diacetyl production has not been evaluated. The objective of the present study was to devise a procedure for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of S. thermophilus. We observed that in a chemically defined medium (CDM) containing alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine, or alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine plus isoleucine, the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutant TIL865, obtained by directed mutagenesis, grew faster than its parent strain. This property was used for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants on agar plates. The resulting mutants were able to grow in milk, and their acidifying activity was slightly lower than that of the parent strain. Under partial anaerobic or aerobic conditions, they produced approximately three times more diacetyl than the parent strain. Such spontaneous mutants may be useful for increasing the diacetyl content of fermented milks whose production involves S. thermophilus strains.
TI  - Improvement in lactic acid production from starch using alpha-amylase-secreting Lactococcus lactis cells adapted to maltose or starch.
AB  - To achieve direct and efficient lactic acid production from starch, a genetically modified Lactococcus lactis IL 1403 secreting alpha-amylase, which was obtained from Streptococcus bovis 148, was constructed. Using this strain, the fermentation of soluble starch was achieved, although its rate was far from efficient (0.09 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). High-performance liquid chromatography revealed that maltose accumulated during fermentation, and this was thought to lead to inefficient fermentation. To accelerate maltose consumption, starch fermentation was examined using L. lactis cells adapted to maltose instead of glucose. This led to a decrease in the amount of maltose accumulation in the culture, and, as a result, a more rapid fermentation was accomplished (1.31 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate). Maximum volumetric lactate productivity was further increased (1.57 g l(-1) h(-1) lactate) using cells adapted to starch, and a high yield of lactate (0.89 g of lactate per gram of consumed sugar) of high optical purity (99.2% of L: -lactate) was achieved. In this study, we propose a new approach to lactate production by alpha-amylase-secreting L. lactis that allows efficient fermentation from starch using cells adapted to maltose or starch before fermentation.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. In addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. To clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis (ARDRA). Twelve distinct clusters were delineated on the basis of ARDRA profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of sodA and 16S rRNA genes. These clusters included the following: Lactococcus raffinolactis, L. garvieae, Lactococcus l., S. iniae, S. dysgalactiae, S. parauberis, S. agalactiae, Carnobacterium spp., the Enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous Enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of Vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized V. carniphilus, V. salmoninarum, and Aerococcus spp. Interestingly, the L. lactis and L. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. The significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, Aerococcus and Enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.
TI  - Influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. The major species used in dairy manufacturing are Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Leuconostoc. Traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. The appearance of the genomes of Lactococcus lactis, Bidifobacterium longum, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, 2 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of LAB. Moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. Comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different LAB in the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the prototype lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is of great importance for the nutrition of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This paper describes the genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, the lactococcal strain most intensively studied throughout the world. The 2,529,478-bp genome contains 81 pseudogenes and encodes 2,436 proteins. Of the 530 unique proteins, 47 belong to the COG (clusters of orthologous groups) functional category "carbohydrate metabolism and transport," by far the largest category of novel proteins in comparison with L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403. Nearly one-fifth of the 71 insertion elements are concentrated in a specific 56-kb region. This integration hot-spot region carries genes that are typically associated with lactococcal plasmids and a repeat sequence specifically found on plasmids and in the "lateral gene transfer hot spot" in the genome of Streptococcus thermophilus. Although the parent of L. lactis MG1363 was used to demonstrate lysogeny in Lactococcus, L. lactis MG1363 carries four remnant/satellite phages and two apparently complete prophages. The availability of the L. lactis MG1363 genome sequence will reinforce its status as the prototype among lactic acid bacteria through facilitation of further applied and fundamental research.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new plasmid pSpnP1 from a multidrug-resistant clone of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A novel Streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pSpnP1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone Poland(23F)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. Sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pSpnP1 is different to pDP1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pSt08, a plasmid from Streptococcus thermophilus. A double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pC194/pUB110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). It also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type A of the Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pMV158/pLS1. Detection of single-stranded DNA by Southern blot analysis indicated that pSpnP1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. Interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative Zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae. Real-time PCR assays revealed that this ORF was expressed. Hybridization experiments showed that the pSpnP1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pSpnP1 were able to replicate in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Mucosal delivery of a pneumococcal vaccine using Lactococcus lactis affords protection against respiratory infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Economical and effective vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are needed for implementation in poorer countries where the disease burden is highest. Here, we evaluated Lactococcus lactis intracellularly producing the pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) as a mucosal vaccine in conferring protection against pneumococcal disease. METHODS: Mice were intranasally (inl) immunized with the lactococcal vaccine. Control groups were also immunized with similar amounts of recombinant PspA administered inl or subcutaneously with alum. PspA-specific antibodies in serum samples and lung lavage fluids were measured before challenge in intraperitoneal sepsis and inl respiratory-infection models of pneumococcal disease. RESULTS: The lactococcal vaccine afforded better protection against respiratory challenge with pneumococcus than did vaccination with purified antigen given inl or by injection with alum. This finding was associated with a shift toward a Th1-mediated immune response characterized by reduced antibody titers to the PspA antigen. In the sepsis model, the lactococcal vaccine afforded resistance to disease on a par with that obtained with the injected vaccine, demonstrating its efficacy against different forms of pneumococcal disease. CONCLUSION: Given the safety profile of L. lactis, there is considerable potential to develop a pneumococcal vaccine for use in humans and to broaden this approach to combat other major pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Identification of an essential gene responsible for D-Asp incorporation in the Lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan crossbridge.
AB  - Bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis have D-aspartate (D-Asp) or its amidated derivative D-asparagine (D-Asn), in their peptidoglycan (PG) interpeptide crossbridge. We performed a subtractive genome analysis to identify L. lactis gene yxbA, orthologues of which being present only in bacteria containing D-amino acids in their PG crossbridge, but absent from those that instead insert L-amino acids or glycine. Inactivation of yxbA required a complementing Streptococcus pneumoniae murMN genes, which express enzymes that incorporate L-Ser-L-Ala or L-Ala-L-Ala in the PG crossbridge. Our results show that (i) yxbA encodes D-Asp ligase responsible for incorporation of D-Asp in the PG crossbridge, and we therefore renamed it as aslA, (ii) it is an essential gene, which makes its product a potential target for specific antimicrobials, (iii) the absence of D-Asp may be complemented by L-Ser-L-Ala or L-Ala-L-Ala in the L. lactis PG, indicating that the PG synthesis machinery is not selective for the side-chain residues, and (iv) lactococcal strains having L-amino acids in their PG crossbridge display defects in cell wall integrity, but are able to efficiently anchor cell wall proteins, indicating relative flexibility of lactococcal transpeptidation reactions with respect to changes in PG sidechain composition.
TI  - Development of lactococcal GEM-based pneumococcal vaccines.
AB  - We report the development of a novel protein-based nasal vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae, in which three pneumococcal proteins were displayed on the surface of a non-recombinant, killed Lactococcus lactis-derived delivery system, called Gram-positive Enhancer Matrix (GEM). The GEM particles induced the production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by macrophages as well as the maturation of dendritic cells. The pneumococcal proteins IgA1 protease (IgA1p), putative proteinase maturation protein A (PpmA) and streptococcal lipoprotein A (SlrA) were anchored in trans to the surface of the GEM particles after recombinant production of the antigens in L. lactis as hybrids with a lactococcal cell wall binding domain, named Protein Anchor domain (PA). Intranasal immunisation with the SlrA-IgA1p or trivalent vaccine combinations without additional adjuvants showed significant protection against fatal pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. The GEM-based trivalent vaccine is a potential pneumococcal vaccine candidate that is expected to be easy to administer, safe and affordable to produce.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a Paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  - A new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. Based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain OSY-DF. The antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin E1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an unknown 2,983-Da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. The latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. The antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including Bacillus spp., Clostridium sporogenes, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria spp., Pediococcus cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, it possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali (pH 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. Edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. While details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic, with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. The coproduction of polymyxin E1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. The new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical applications.
TI  - Identification of a novel virulence determinant with serum opacification activity in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. In other streptococci, large surface-associated proteins (>100 kDa) of the MSCRAMM family (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) are key players in interactions with host tissue. In this study, we identified a novel opacity factor of S. suis (OFS) with structural homology to members of the MSCRAMM family. The N-terminal region of OFS is homologous to the respective regions of fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBA) of Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the serum opacity factor (SOF) of Streptococcus pyogenes. Similar to these two proteins, the N-terminal domain of OFS opacified horse serum. Serum opacification activity was detectable in sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of wild-type S. suis but not in extracts of isogenic ofs knockout mutants. Heterologous expression of OFS in Lactococcus lactis demonstrated that a high level of expression of OFS is sufficient to provide surface-associated serum opacification activity. Furthermore, serum opacification could be inhibited by an antiserum against recombinant OFS. The C-terminal repetitive sequence elements of OFS differed significantly from the respective repeat regions of FnBA and SOF as well as from the consensus sequence of the fibronectin-binding repeats of MSCRAMMs. Accordingly, fibronectin binding was not detectable in recombinant OFS. To investigate the putative function of OFS in the pathogenesis of invasive S. suis diseases, piglets were experimentally infected with an isogenic mutant strain in which the ofs gene had been knocked out by an in-frame deletion. The mutant was severely attenuated in virulence but not in colonization, demonstrating that OFS represents a novel virulence determinant of S. suis.
TI  - Different subcellular locations of secretome components of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria contain different types of secretion systems for the transport of proteins into or across the cytoplasmic membrane. Recent studies on subcellular localization of specific components of these secretion systems and their substrates have shown that they can be present at various locations in the cell. The translocons of the general Sec secretion system in the rod-shaped bacterium Bacillus subtilis have been shown to localize in spirals along the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas the translocons in the coccoid Streptococcus pyogenes are located in a microdomain near the septum. In both bacteria the Sec translocons appear to be located near the sites of cell wall synthesis. The Tat secretion system, which is used for the transport of folded proteins, probably localizes in the cytoplasmic membrane and at the cell poles of B. subtilis. In Lactococcus lactis the ABC transporter dedicated to the transport of a small antimicrobial peptide is distributed throughout the membrane. Possible mechanisms for maintaining the localization of these secretion machineries involve their interaction with proteins of the cytoskeleton or components of the cell wall synthesis machinery, or the presence of lipid subdomains surrounding the transport systems.
TI  - Heterologous production and secretion of Clostridium perfringens beta-toxoid in closely related Gram-positive hosts.
AB  - The spore forming bacterium Clostridium perfringens is a widely occurring pathogen. Vaccines against C. perfringens type B and C are currently manufactured using beta-toxin secreted by virulent C. perfringens strains. Large-scale production of vaccines from virulent strains requires stringent safety conditions and costly detoxification and control steps. Therefore, it would be beneficial to produce this toxin in a safe production host and in an immunogenic, but non-toxic form (toxoid). For high-level expression of beta-toxoid, we cloned the highly active ribosomal rpsF promoter of Bacillus subtilis in a broad host range multicopy plasmid. In B. subtilis, we obtained high intracellular production, up to 200 microg ml(-1) culture. However, the beta-toxoid was poorly secreted. The employed rpsF expression system allowed using the same expression plasmids in other heterologous hosts such as Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In these organisms secretion of beta-toxoid was ten times higher compared to the best producing B. subtilis strain. These results show the usefulness of the rpsF based broad host range expression system.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for the detection and identification of dairy bacteriophages in milk.
AB  - Bacteriophage infections of starter lactic acid bacteria are a serious risk in the dairy industry. Phage infection can lead to slow lactic acid production or even the total failure of fermentation. The associated economic losses can be substantial. Rapid and sensitive methods are therefore required to detect and identify phages at all stages of the manufacture of fermented dairy products. This study describes a simple and rapid multiplex PCR method that, in a single reaction, detects the presence of bacteriophages infecting Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, plus three genetically distinct 'species' of Lactococcus lactis phages commonly found in dairy plants (P335, 936 and c2). Available bacteriophage genome sequences were examined and the conserved regions used to design five pairs of primers, one for each of the above bacteriophage species. These primers were designed to generate specific fragments of different size depending on the species. Since this method can detect the above phages in untreated milk and can be easily incorporated into dairy industry routines, it might be readily used to earmark contaminated milk for use in processes that do not involve susceptible starter organisms or for use in those that involve phage-deactivating conditions.
TI  - Serum opacity factor promotes group A streptococcal epithelial cell invasion and  virulence.
AB  - Serum opacity factor (SOF) is a bifunctional cell surface protein expressed by 40-50% of group A streptococcal (GAS) strains comprised of a C-terminal domain that binds fibronectin and an N-terminal domain that mediates opacification of mammalian sera. The sof gene was recently discovered to be cotranscribed in a two-gene operon with a gene encoding another fibronectin-binding protein, sfbX. We compared the ability of a SOF(+) wild-type serotype M49 GAS strain and isogenic mutants lacking SOF or SfbX to invade cultured HEp-2 human pharyngeal epithelial cells. Elimination of SOF led to a significant decrease in HEp-2 intracellular invasion while loss of SfbX had minimal effect. The hypoinvasive phenotype of the SOF(-) mutant could be restored upon complementation with the sof gene on a plasmid vector, and heterologous expression of sof49 in M1 GAS or Lactococcus lactis conferred marked increases in HEp-2 cell invasion. Studies using a mutant sof49 gene lacking the fibronectin-binding domain indicated that the N-terminal opacification domain of SOF contributes to HEp-2 invasion independent of the C-terminal fibronectin binding domain, findings corroborated by observations that a purified SOF N-terminal peptide could promote latex bead adherence to HEp-2 cells and inhibit GAS invasion of HEp-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, the first in vivo studies to employ a single gene allelic replacement mutant of SOF demonstrate that this protein contributes to GAS virulence in a murine model of necrotizing skin infection.
TI  - Accuracy of species identity of commercial bacterial cultures intended for probiotic or nutritional use.
AB  - Independent studies have indicated that the microbiological composition of several commercial probiotic products does not correspond to the product label information. The present study set out to investigate to what extent these problems may be due to the use of misidentified cultures at the onset of production. For this purpose, 213 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and propionibacteria intended for probiotic or nutritional use were collected from 26 manufacturers of probiotic products, three international culture collections and one research institute. The accuracy of the taxonomic identity provided by the strain depositor was assessed through a polyphasic approach based on validated and standardized identification methods including fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) and repetitive DNA element (rep)-PCR fingerprinting, protein profiling and partial 16S rDNA sequencing. The majority of the cultures were received as members of the genera Lactobacillus (57%) and Bifidobacterium (22%); however, propionibacteria, enterococci, Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis), Streptococcus thermophilus and pediococci were also obtained. Upon reidentification, 46 cases of misidentification at the genus level (n=19) or species level (n=27) were recorded, including 34 commercial probiotic cultures deposited by 10 different companies. The finding that more than 28% of the commercial cultures intended for human and/or animal probiotic use were misidentified at the genus or species level suggests that many cases of probiotic product mislabeling originate from the incorporation of incorrectly identified strains. A large number of these discrepancies could be related to the use of methods with limited taxonomic resolution (e.g., API strips) or that are unsuitable for reliable identification up to species level (e.g., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis). The current study has again highlighted that reliable identification of LAB and propionibacteria requires molecular methods with a high taxonomic resolution that are linked to up-to-date identification libraries.
TI  - Enhanced nutty flavor formation in cheddar cheese made with a malty Lactococcus lactis adjunct culture.
AB  - Nutty flavor in Cheddar cheese is desirable, and recent research demonstrated that 2- and 3-methyl butanal and 2-methyl propanal were primary sources of nutty flavors in Cheddar. Because malty strains of Lac-tococcus lactis (formerly Streptococcus lactis var. malti-genes) are characterized by the efficient production of these and other Strecker aldehydes during growth, this study investigated the influence of a malty L. lactis adjunct culture on nutty flavor development in Cheddar cheese. Cheeses made with different adjunct levels (0, 10(4) cfu/mL, and 10(5) cfu/mL) were ripened at 5 or 13 degrees C and analyzed after 1 wk, 4 mo, and 8 mo by a combination of instrumental and sensory methods to characterize nutty flavor development. Cheeses ripened at 13 degrees C developed aged flavors (brothy, sulfur, and nutty flavors) more rapidly than cheeses held at 5 degrees C. Additionally, cheeses made with the adjunct culture showed more rapid and more intense nutty flavor development than control cheeses. Cheeses that had higher intensities of nutty flavors also had a higher concentration of 2/3-methyl butanal and 2-methyl propanal compared with control cheeses, which again confirmed that these compounds are a source of nutty flavor in Cheddar cheese. Results from this study provide a simple methodology for cheese manufacturers to obtain consistent nutty flavor in Cheddar cheese.
TI  - Effect of high-pressure treatment and a bacteriocin-producing lactic culture on the proteolysis, texture, and taste of Hispanico cheese.
AB  - The effects of high-pressure treatment, by itself or in combination with a bacteriocin-producing culture added to milk, on the proteolysis, texture, and taste of Hispanico cheese were investigated. Two vats of cheese were manufactured from a mixture of cow and ewe milk. Milk in one vat was inoculated with 0.5% Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis INIA 415, a nisin Z and lacticin 481 producer; 0.5% L. lactis ssp. lactis INIA 415-2, a bacteriocin-nonproducing mutant; and 2% of a commercial Streptococcus thermophilus culture. Milk in the other vat was inoculated with 1% L. lactis ssp. lactis INIA 415-2 and 2% S. thermophilus culture. After ripening for 15 d at 12 degrees C, half of the cheeses from each vat were treated at 400 MPa for 5 min at 10 degrees C. Ripening of high-pressure-treated and untreated cheeses continued at 12 degrees C until d 50. High-pressure treatment of cheese made from milk without the bacteriocin producer accelerated casein degradation and increased the free AA content, but it did not significantly influence the taste quality or taste intensity of the cheese. Addition of the bacteriocin producer to milk lowered the ratio of hydrophobic peptides to hydrophilic peptides, increased the free AA content, and enhanced the taste intensity. The combination of milk inoculation with the bacteriocin producer and high-pressure treatment of the cheese resulted in higher levels of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides but had no significant effect on the free AA content, taste quality, or taste intensity.
TI  - Use of Lactococcus lactis expressing pili from group B Streptococcus as a broad-coverage vaccine against streptococcal disease.
AB  - Recent data indicate that the human pathogen group B Streptococcus (GBS) produces pilus-like structures encoded in genomic islands with similar organization to pathogenicity islands. On the basis of the amino acid sequence of their protein components, 3 different types of pili have been identified in GBS, at least 1 of which is present in all isolates. We recently demonstrated that recombinant pilus proteins protect mice from lethal challenge with GBS and are thus potential vaccine candidates. Here, we show that GBS pilin island 1, transferred into the nonpathogenic microorganism Lactococcus lactis, leads to pilus assembly. We also show that systemically or mucosally delivered Lactococcus expressing pilin island 1 protects mice from challenge with GBS isolates carrying pilus 1. Furthermore, lactococci engineered to express hybrid pili containing GBS pilus 1 and pilus 2 components confer protection against strains expressing either of the 2 pilus types. These data pave the way to the design of pilus-based, multivalent live vaccines against streptococcal pathogens.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis GEM particles displaying pneumococcal antigens induce local and systemic immune responses following intranasal immunization.
AB  - The present work reports the use of non-living non-recombinant bacteria as a delivery system for mucosal vaccination. Antigens are bound to the cell-wall of pretreated Lactococcus lactis, designated as Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM), by means of a peptidoglycan binding domain. The influence of the GEM particles on the antigen-specific serum antibody response was studied. Following nasal immunization with the GEM-based vaccines, antibody responses were induced at systemic and local levels. Furthermore, different GEM-based vaccines could be used consecutively in the same mice without adverse effects or loss of activity. Taken together, the results evidence the adjuvant properties of the GEM particles and indicate that GEM-based vaccines can be used repeatedly and are particularly suitable for nasal immunization purposes.
TI  - Characterization of dominant microbiota of a Ghanaian fermented milk product, nyarmie, by culture- and nonculture-based methods.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize the predominant micro-organisms in a Ghanaian traditional fermented dairy product, nyarmie, made from cows' milk, using both culture- and nonculture-based methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of nyarmie were analysed from three production sites in Accra, by determining the counts on selective culture media. The microbial diversity occurring in nyarmie was also evaluated by 16S/18S ribosomal DNA PCR amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Results showed that nyarmie contained lactococci and lactobacilli in the range of 10(8) and 10(10) CFU ml(-1), respectively, and yeasts at around 10(7) CFU ml(-1). The pH ranged between 3.49 and 4.25. The predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in nyarmie were Leuconostocmesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lact.helveticus, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the predominant yeast species. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. delbrueckii was not detected by cultivation but its predominance was revealed by PCR-DGGE analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The flora in products from different producers varied in the LAB composition present and may result in variations in product quality. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Development and use of starter cultures for nyarmie may be beneficial in improving the consistency of product quality.
TI  - A lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces Streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterise Streptococcus mutans from Irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC3147. METHODS AND RESULTS: Saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on Mitis Salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. Following selective plating, 16S rDNA sequencing and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), 15 distinct strains of Strep. mutans were identified. These were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis HP. Inhibition of indicator Strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. The concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 AU ml(-1). Concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of Strep. mutans strains in broth. Moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with Strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 AU ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. Furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of Strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. CONCLUSION: A food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral Strep. mutans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.
TI  - The ltp gene of temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34 confers superinfection exclusion to Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The ltp gene, located within the lysogeny module of temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage TP-J34, has been shown to be expressed in lysogenic strain S. thermophilus J34. It codes for a lipoprotein, as demonstrated by inhibition of cleavage of the signal sequence by globomycin. Exposure of Ltp on the surface of Lactococcus lactis protoplasts bearing a plasmid-encoded copy of ltp has been demonstrated by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. Expression of ltp in prophage- and plasmid-cured S. thermophilus J34-6f interfered with TP-J34 infection. While plating efficiency was reduced by a factor of about 40 and lysis of strain J34-6f in liquid medium was delayed considerably, phage adsorption was not affected at all. Intracellular accumulation of phage DNA was shown to be inhibited by Ltp. This indicates interference of Ltp with infection at the stage of triggering DNA release and injection into the cell, indicating a role of Ltp in superinfection exclusion. Expression of ltp in L. lactis Bu2-60 showed that the same superinfection exclusion mechanism was strongly effective against phage P008, a member of the lactococcal 936 phage species: no plaque-formation was detectable with even 10(9) phage per ml applied, and lysis in liquid medium did not occur. In Lactococcus also, Ltp apparently inhibited phage DNA release and/or injection. Ltp appears to be a member of a family of small, secreted proteins with a 42 amino acids repeat structure encoded by genes of Gram-positive bacteria. Some of these homologous genes are part of the genomes of prophages.
TI  - Artisanal and experimental Pecorino Siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and PCR-DGGE analyses.
AB  - Traditional artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheeses, and two experimental PS cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. The bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene to that of reference species. The culture-independent fingerprinting technique PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of samples taken during artisanal PS cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. The dominance of Streptococcus bovis and Lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal PS was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of DGGE profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental PS cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. Nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional PS cheese.
TI  - Conservation of key elements of natural competence in Lactococcus lactis ssp.
AB  - Natural competence is active in very diverse species of the bacterial kingdom and probably participates in horizontal gene transfer. Recently, the genome sequence of various species, including Lactococcus lactis, revealed the presence of homologues of competence genes in bacteria, which were not previously identified as naturally transformable. We investigated the conservation among lactococcal strains of key components of the natural competence process in streptococci: (i) comX which encodes a sigma factor, allowing the expression of the late competence genes involved in DNA uptake, (ii) its recognition site, the cin-box and (iii) dprA which encodes a protein shown to determine the fate of incoming DNA. The comX and dprA genes and the cin-box appeared conserved among strains, although some L. lactis ssp. lactis strains presented an inactivated dprA gene. We established that ComX controls the expression of the late competence genes in L. lactis. In conclusion, our work strongly suggests that ComX has the same role in streptococci and L. lactis, i.e. the regulation of late competence genes. It also allowed the identification of a set of L. lactis strains and the construction of a comX overexpression system, which should facilitate the investigation of the natural competence activity in lactococci.
TI  - Induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen A.
AB  - Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.
TI  - CopY-like copper inducible repressors are putative 'winged helix' proteins.
AB  - CopY of Enterococcus hirae is a well characterized copper-responsive repressor involved in copper homeostasis. In the absence of copper, it binds to the promoter. In high copper, the CopZ copper chaperone donates copper to CopY, thereby releasing it from the promoter and allowing transcription of the downstream copper homeostatic genes of the cop operon. We here show that the CopY-like repressors from E. hirae, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus mutans have similar affinities not only for their native promoters, but also for heterologous cop promoters. CopZ of L. lactis accelerated the release of CopY from the promoter, suggesting that CopZ of L. lactis acts as copper chaperone, similar to CopZ in E. hirae. The consensus binding motif of the CopY-like repressors was shown to be TACAxxTGTA. The same binding motif is present in promoters controlled by BlaI of Bacillus licheniformis, MecI of Staphylococcus aureus and related repressors. BlaI and MecI have known structures and belong to the family of 'winged helix' proteins. In the N- terminal domain, they share significant sequence similarity with CopY of E. hirae. Moreover, they bind to the same TACAxxTGTA motif. NMR analysis of the N-terminal DNA binding domain of CopY of L. lactis showed that it contained the same alpha-helical content like the same regions of BlaI and MecI. These findings suggest that the DNA binding domains of CopY-like repressors are also of the 'winged helix' type.
TI  - Use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  - Conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (Kohonen Self Organizing Map) and supervised (Bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus including 47 reference strains. Electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by Piraino et al. [Piraino, P., Ricciardi, A., Lanorte, M. T., Malkhazova, I., Parente, E., 2002. A new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. Biotechnol. Lett. 24, 1477-1482]. Hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (Leuconostoc, Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus, Lb. plantarum/Lb. paraplantarum, Lc. lactis/Lc. raffinolactis). A 7x7 Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. The map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. Two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 Bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of SDS-PAGE patterns of Lc. lactis from those of other species. We conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
TI  - Molecular and genetic characterization of a novel nisin variant produced by Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis is one of the principal causative agents of bovine mastitis. In this study, we report that S. uberis strain 42 produces a lantibiotic, nisin U, which is 78% identical (82% similar) to nisin A from Lactococcus lactis. The 15.6-kb nisin U locus comprises 11 open reading frames, similar in putative functionality but differing in arrangement from that of the nisin A biosynthetic cluster. The nisin U producer strain exhibits specific resistance (immunity) to nisin U and cross-resistance to nisin A, a finding consistent with the 55% sequence similarity of their respective immunity peptides. Homologues of the nisin U structural gene were identified in several additional S. uberis strains, and in each case cross-protective immunity was expressed to nisin A and to the other producers of nisin U and its variants. To our knowledge, this is the first report both of characterization of a bacteriocin by S. uberis, as well as of a member of the nisin family of peptides in a species other than L. lactis.
TI  - Food commensal microbes as a potentially important avenue in transmitting antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant (ART) pathogens is a major threat to  public health. While the surfacing of ART food-borne pathogens is alarming, the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance (AR) gene pool in food-borne commensal microbes is yet to be revealed. Incidence of ART commensals in selected retail food products was examined in this study. The presence of 10(2)-10(7) CFU of ART bacteria per gram of foods in many samples, particularly in ready-to-eat, 'healthy' food items, indicates that the ART bacteria are abundant in the food chain. AR-encoding genes were detected in ART isolates, and Streptococcus thermophilus was found to be a major host for AR genes in cheese microbiota. Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc sp. isolates were also found carrying AR genes. The data indicate that food could be an important avenue for ART bacterial evolution and dissemination. AR-encoding plasmids from several food-borne commensals were transmitted to Streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation under laboratory conditions, suggesting the possible transfer of AR genes from food commensals to human residential bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - To have neighbour's fare: extending the molecular toolbox for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - In past years, several useful genetic tools have been developed to study the molecular biology of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In order to extend the existing spectrum of tools, advantage was taken of the toolbox originally developed for the closely related bacterium Lactococcus lactis, which was adapted for the manipulation of S. pneumoniae. The modified tools are as follows. (i) An improved nisin-inducible (over)expression system (NICE). The nisRK genes, encoding a two-component system essential for transcriptional activation in response to nisin, were integrated into the bgaA locus of S. pneumoniae D39. In this strain, D39nisRK, addition of nisin resulted in the overexpression of several genes placed under the control of the nisin-inducible promoter, while no detectable expression was observed in the absence of nisin. (ii) A lacZ reporter system. Using strain D39nisRK, which lacks endogenous beta-galactosidase activity, the usefulness of the lacZ reporter vector pORI13 for the generation of chromosomal transcriptional fusions was demonstrated. In addition, the repA gene, necessary for the replication of pORI13, was introduced into the bgaA locus, thereby generating a background for plasmid-based promoter expression studies. (iii) A simplified chemically defined medium, which supports growth of all sequenced S. pneumoniae strains to a level comparable to that in complex medium. (iv) A system for the introduction of unmarked deletions and mutations into the chromosome, which is independent of the genotype of the target strain. Most of these systems were successfully applied in strains R6 and TIGR4 as well. In addition, the tools offer several improvements and advantages compared to existing ones. Thus, the molecular toolbox for S. pneumoniae has been successfully extended.
TI  - Mucosal vaccine delivery of antigens tightly bound to an adjuvant particle made from food-grade bacteria.
AB  - Mucosal immunization with subunit vaccines requires new types of antigen delivery vehicles and adjuvants for optimal immune responses. We have developed a non-living and non-genetically modified gram-positive bacterial delivery particle (GEM) that has built-in adjuvant activity and a high loading capacity for externally added heterologous antigens that are fused to a high affinity binding domain. This binding domain, the protein anchor (PA), is derived from the Lactococcus lactis AcmA cell-wall hydrolase, and contains three repeats of a LysM-type cell-wall binding motif. Antigens are produced as antigen-PA fusions by recombinant expression systems that secrete the hybrid proteins into the culture growth medium. GEM particles are then used as affinity beads to isolate the antigen-PA fusions from the complex growth media in a one step procedure after removal of the recombinant producer cells. This procedure is also highly suitable for making multivalent vaccines. The resulting vaccines are stable at room temperature, lack recombinant DNA, and mimic pathogens by their bacterial size, surface display of antigens and adjuvant activity of the bacterial components in the GEM particles. The GEM-based vaccines do not require additional adjuvant for eliciting high levels of specific antibodies in mucosal and systemic compartments.
TI  - Effects of Lactococcus lactis on composition of intestinal microbiota: role of nisin.
AB  - This study examined the ability of (i) pure nisin, (ii) nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis strain CHCC5826, and (iii) the non-nisin-producing L. lactis strain CHCH2862 to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota of human flora-associated rats. The presence of both the nisin-producing and the non-nisin-producing L. lactis strains significantly increased the number of Bifidobacterium cells in fecal samples during the first 8 days but decreased the number of enterococci/streptococci in duodenum, ileum, cecum, and colon samples as detected by selective cultivation. No significant changes in the rat fecal microbiota were observed after dosage with nisin. Pearson cluster analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of the 16S rRNA genes present in the fecal microbial population revealed that the microbiota of animals dosed with either of the two L. lactis strains were different from that of control animals dosed with saline. However, profiles of the microbiota from animals dosed with nisin did not differ from the controls. The concentrations of nisin estimated by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were approximately 10-fold higher in the small intestine and 200-fold higher in feces than the corresponding concentrations estimated by a biological assay. This indicates that nisin was degraded or inactivated in the gastrointestinal tract, since fragments of this bacteriocin are detected by ELISA while an intact molecule is needed to retain biological activity.
TI  - Probiotics down-regulate flaA sigma28 promoter in Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are important members of the gastrointestinal microflora of humans and animals and are thought to have positive effects on human health. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in using these microorganisms as probiotics to be incorporated into either fermented dairy products or tablets. However, convincing scientific data that support claims of their health benefits are scarce. The effect of cell-free extracts of milk fermented by 10 probiotic bacteria (five Bifidobacterium strains and five Lactobacillus strains) on the expression of the flaA gene of Campylobacter jejuni was assessed using a fusion between the flaA sigma28 promoter and a promoterless luxCDABE cassette carried on the plasmid pRYluxCDABE, which resulted in strains with quantifiable luminescence linked to flaA sigma28 promoter activity. Cell-free extracts of milk fermented by all of the tested probiotic strains inhibited the growth of the C. jejuni and down-regulatedflaA sigma28 promoter activity. Two nonprobiotic lactic acid bacterial strains, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, were less inhibitory.
TI  - Amino acid profiles of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains and kefir starter made from them.
AB  - The characteristics of cell growth, lactic acid production, amino acid release and consumption by single-strain cultures of lactic acid bacteria (isolated from kefir grains), and by a multiple-strain kefir starter prepared from them, were studied. The change in the levels of free amino acids was followed throughout the kefir process: single-strain kefir bacteria and the kefir starter (Lactococcus lactis C15-1%+Lactobacillus helveticus MP12-3%+(Streptococcus thermophilus T15+Lactobacillus bulgaricus HP1 = 1:1)-3%) were cultivated in pasteurized (92 degrees C for 20 min) cow's milk (3% fat content) at 28 degrees C for 5 h (the kefir starter reached pH 4.7) and subsequently grown at 20 degrees C for 16 h; storage was at 4 degrees C for 168 h. The strain L. helveticus MP12 was unrivaled with respect to free amino acid production (53.38 mg (100 g)(-1)) and cell growth (17.8 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1)); however, it manifested the lowest acidification activity. L. bulgaricus HP1 released approximately 3.7 times less amino acids, nearly 5 times lower cell growth, and produced about 1.2 times more lactic acid. S. thermophilus T15 demonstrated dramatically complex amino acid necessities for growth and metabolism. With L. lactis C15, the highest levels of growth and lactic acid synthesis were recorded (18.3 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) and 7.8 g l(-1) lactic acid at the 21st hour), and as for free amino acid production, it approximated L. bulgaricus HP1 (17.03 mg (100 g)(-1) maximum concentration). In the L. lactis C15 culture, the amino acids were used more actively throughout the first exponential growth phase (by the 10th hour) than during the second growth phase. The unique properties of the L. helveticus MP12 strain to produce amino acids were employed to create a symbiotic bioconsortium kefir culture, which, under conditions of kefir formation, enhanced lactic acid production and shortened the time required to reach pH 4.7; intensified cell growth activity, resulting in a respective 90- and 60-fold increase in the concentration of lactobacilli and cocci in the mixed culture compared to individual cultures; and accumulated free amino acids in the final kefir with higher total concentrations (56.88 mg (100 g)(-1)) and an individual concentration of essential amino acids (1.5 times) greater than that of yogurt.
TI  - Effects of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat Cheddar cheese.
AB  - The objective was to study the influence of different exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing and nonproducing lactic cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat Cheddar cheese. Changes in the viscoelastic properties were followed over a ripening period of 6 mo. Results showed that the elastic, viscous, and complex moduli were higher in reduced-fat cheeses made with EPS-nonproducing cultures than in full-fat cheese. No differences in the viscoelastic properties were found between young reduced-fat cheese made with a ropy strain of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (JFR1) and its full-fat counterpart. Interestingly, the changes in viscoelastic moduli in both full-fat cheese and reduced-fat cheese made with JFR1 during ripening followed the same pattern. Whereas the moduli increased during the first month of ripening in those 2 cheeses, a dramatic decrease was observed in all other cheeses. Slopes of the viscoelastic moduli as a function of frequency were lower in the full-fat than in reduced-fat cheeses. The creep test showed that fresh reduced-fat cheese made with JFR1 was less rigid and more deformable than that made with EPS-nonproducing cultures. The creep and recovery properties of young reduced-fat cheese made with JFR1 and the full-fat type were similar. No differences were found in the viscoelastic properties between reduced-fat cheese made with no EPS and those made with EPS-producing adjunct cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus. After 6 mo of ripening, cheeses made with EPS-producing cultures maintained lower elastic and viscous moduli than did those made with no EPS.
TI  - Application of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures in reduced-fat Cheddar cheese: composition and proteolysis.
AB  - Proteolysis during ripening of reduced fat Cheddar cheeses made with different exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing and nonproducing cultures was studied. A ropy strain of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (JFR1) and capsule-forming nonropy and moderately ropy strains of Streptococcus thermophilus were used in making reduced-fat Cheddar cheese. Commercial Cheddar starter was used in making full-fat cheese. Results showed that the actual yield of cheese made with JFR1 was higher than that of all other reduced-fat cheeses. Cheese made with JFR1 contained higher moisture, moisture in the nonfat substance, and residual coagulant activity than all other reduced-fat cheeses. Proteolysis, as determined by PAGE and the level of water-soluble nitrogen, was also higher in cheese made with JFR1 than in all other cheeses. The HPLC analysis showed a significant increase in hydrophobic peptides (causing bitterness) during storage of cheese made with JFR1. Cheese made with the capsule-forming nonropy adjunct of S. thermophilus, which contained lower moisture and moisture in the nonfat substance levels and lower chymosin activity than did cheese made with JFR1, accumulated less hydrophobic peptides. In conclusion, some EPS-producing cultures produced reduced-fat Cheddar cheese with moisture in the nonfat substance similar to that in its full-fat counterpart without the need for modifying the standard cheese-making protocol. Such cultures might accumulate hydrophobic (bitter) peptides if they do not contain the system able to hydrolyze them. For making high quality reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, EPS-producing cultures should be used in conjunction with debittering strains.
TI  - [Construction and identification of exogenous gene expression system in Lactococcus lactis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct and characterize an exogenous gene expression system in Lactococcus lactis. METHODS: PCR-based gene assembly was used to synthesize the gene sequence containing P59 promoter, USP45 signal peptide, ribosome binding site and multiple cloning site. Plasmid pBS-pu was obtained after ligation of the assembled sequence with pBluescript II SK (+), and the terminator of USP45 protein was added to construct the recombinant plasmid pNBC1000. The gene coding for Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein was amplified and cloned into pNBC1000 to obtain the plasmid pNBC2000. To characterize the expression system, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was amplified from the plasmid pEGFP-N1 and cloned into pNBC2000. Laser scanning confocal microscope was used to observe the bacteria containing pNBC2000, pNBC2000-EGFP or pBS-EGFP. RESULTS: Green fluorescence was visualized in the bacteria containing pNBC2000-EGFP, but not in the bacteria containing pNBC2000 or pBS-EGFP. CONCLUSION: The plasmids pNBC1000 and pNBC2000 containing P59 promoter, USP45 signal peptide, ribosome binding site and multiple cloning sites are successfully constructed, which are capable of expressing exogenous gene in Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
TI  - The recombinant phage lysin LysK has a broad spectrum of lytic activity against clinically relevant staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study concerns the cloning, characterization, and expression of the lysin (LysK) from staphylococcal phage K in Lactococcus lactis. Lactococcal lysates containing recombinant LysK were found to inhibit a range of different species of staphylococci isolated from bovine and human infection sources, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. LysK thus has potential as an antimicrobial for applications in the prevention and/or treatment of infections caused by staphylococci.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Adherence to and invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells are promoted by fibrinogen-binding protein FbsA of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a frequent cause of bacterial sepsis and meningitis in neonates. During the course of infection, S. agalactiae colonizes and invades a number of host compartments, thereby interacting with different host tissues. Deletion of the fbsA gene, encoding the fibrinogen protein FbsA, significantly impaired the adherence and invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) by S. agalactiae. The adherence and invasiveness of an fbsA deletion mutant were restored by reintroducing the fbsA gene on an expression vector. Heterologous expression of fbsA in Lactococcus lactis enabled this bacterium to adhere to but not to invade HBMEC, suggesting that FbsA is a streptococcal adhesin. Finally, host cell adherence and invasion were significantly blocked in competition experiments with either purified FbsA fusion protein or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fibrinogen-binding epitope of FbsA. The S. agalactiae fbsA mutant induced a release of the neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin-8 (IL-8) equal to that induced by the wild type. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that FbsA promotes the adherence of S. agalactiae to HBMEC but that FbsA neither mediates the bacterial invasion into host cells nor plays a role in IL-8 release for HBMEC.
TI  - Use of an alpha-galactosidase gene as a food-grade selection marker for Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The alpha-galactosidase gene (aga) of Lactococcus raffinolactis ATCC 43920 was previously shown to be an efficient food-grade selection marker in Lactococcus lactis and Pediococcus acidilactici but not in Streptococcus thermophilus. In this study, we demonstrated that the alpha-galactosidase of L. raffinolactis is thermolabile and inoperative at 42 degrees C, the optimal growth temperature of S. thermophilus. An in vitro assay indicated that the activity of this alpha-galactosidase at 42 degrees C was only 3% of that at 30 degrees C, whereas the enzyme retained 23% of its activity at 37 degrees C. Transformation of Strep. thermophilus RD733 with the shuttle-vector pNZ123 bearing the aga gene of L. raffinolactis (pRAF301) generated transformants that were stable and able to grow on melibiose and raffinose at 37 degrees C or below. The transformed cells possessed 6-fold more alpha-galactosidase activity after growth on melibiose than cells grown on lactose. Slot-blot analyses of aga mRNA indicated that repression by lactose occurred at the transcriptional level. The presence of pRAF301 did not interfere with the lactic acid production when the transformed cells of Strep. thermophilus were grown at the optimal temperature in milk. Using the recombinant plasmid pRAF301, which carries a chloramphenicol resistance gene in addition to aga, we showed that both markers were equally efficient at differentiating transformed from nontransformed cells. The aga gene of L. raffinolactis can be used as a highly efficient selection marker in Strep. thermophilus.
TI  - The specificity of oligopeptide transport by Streptococcus thermophilus resembles that of Lactococcus lactis and not that of pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Peptide transport is a crucial step in the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in protein- or peptide-containing media. The objective of the present work was to determine the specificity of peptide utilization by this widely used lactic acid bacterium. To reach that goal, complementary approaches were employed. The capability of a proteinase-negative S. thermophilus strain to grow in a chemically defined medium containing a mixture of peptides isolated from milk as the source of amino acids was analysed. Peptides were separated into three size classes by ultrafiltration. The strain was able to use peptides up to 3.5 kDa during growth, as revealed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses. The same strain was grown in chemically defined medium containing a tryptic digest of casein, and the respective time-course consumption of the peptides during growth was estimated. The ability to consume large peptides (up to 23 residues) was confirmed, as long as they are cationic and hydrophobic. These results were confirmed by peptide transport studies. Extension of the study to 11 other strains revealed that they all shared these preferences.
TI  - Flavour formation by lactic acid bacteria and biochemical flavour profiling of cheese products.
AB  - Flavour development in dairy fermentations, most notably cheeses, results from a  series of (bio)chemical processes in which the starter cultures provide the enzymes. Particularly the enzymatic degradation of proteins (caseins) leads to the formation of key-flavour components, which contribute to the sensory perception of dairy products. More specifically, caseins are degraded into peptides and amino acids and the latter are major precursors for volatile aroma compounds. In particular, the conversion of methionine, the aromatic and the branched-chain amino acids are crucial. A lot of research has focused on the degradation of caseins into peptides and free amino acids, and more recently, enzymes involved in the conversion of amino acids were identified. Most data are generated on Lactococcus lactis, which is the predominant organism in starter cultures used for cheese-making, but also Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Propionibacterium and species used for surface ripening of cheeses are characterised in their flavour-forming capacity. In this paper, various enzymes and pathways involved in flavour formation will be highlighted and the impact of these findings for the development of industrial starter cultures will be discussed.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Engagement of CD46 and alpha5beta1 integrin by group A streptococci is required for efficient invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  - Membrane cofactor protein (MCP or CD46), a widely distributed complement regulatory human protein, is a cell surface receptor for many pathogens including group A streptococci (GAS). The surface M protein of GAS binds CD46 and mediates GAS adherence to keratinocytes. In the present study, we studied the role of CD46 in GAS invasion of human lung epithelial cells, A549. Anti-CD46 antibody which specifically blocks the domain to which M protein binds inhibited adherence to and invasion of A549 cells by GAS. Moreover, downregulation of CD46 expression on A549 by RNA interference resulted in reduced invasion of these cells by GAS. A mutant form of CD46 with a deletion in the cytoplasmic domain was overexpressed in A549 cells, which resulted in partial inhibition of invasion. This indicates that the cytoplasmic tail is required for CD46 to promote invasion by GAS. Invasion assays with Lactococcus lactis that express M protein demonstrated the dependence of CD46-promoted invasion on interaction with M protein. In addition, CD46-mediated invasion was also found to be dependent on the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin.
TI  - Cell-surface display of E7 antigen from human papillomavirus type-16 in Lactococcus lactis and in Lactobacillus plantarum using a new cell-wall anchor from lactobacilli.
AB  - The human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 protein is considered a major viral  oncoprotein involved in cervical cancer (CxCa) and a potential candidate for the development of a vaccine against this neoplasia. Here, two lactic acid bacteria (the model one Lactococcus lactis and a probiotic one Lactobacillus plantarum) were engineered to deliver an E7 mutant protein (E7mm), which has a reduced transforming activity and consequently, could fit better to therapeutic use in humans than the native form of E7. An efficient cell-surface display of E7mm was obtained in L. lactis using an expression cassette encoding a precursor composed of (i) the signal peptide and the first 15 amino acids of the mature part of the lactococcal Usp45 protein; (ii) E7mm and (iii) the cell-wall anchor of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein (CWA(M6)). This hybrid precursor was produced but not cell-wall anchored in Lb. plantarum. We thus replaced CWA(M6) by the cell-wall anchor of a Lb. plantarum protein which allows an efficient cell-wall anchoring of E7mm in this bacterium. The E7mm production and cell-surface display in both L. lactis and a probiotic bacterium, Lb. plantarum, represent one more step towards the development of a safe and effective treatment against CxCa.
TI  - The structural comparison of the bacterial PepX and human DPP-IV reveals sites for the design of inhibitors of PepX activity.
AB  - X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (X-PDAP) are enzymes catalysing the release of dipeptides from the amino termini of polypeptides containing a proline or an alanine at the penultimate position. Involved in various mammalian regulation processes, as well as in chronic human diseases, they have been proposed to play a role in pathogenicity for Streptococci. We compared the structure of X-PDAP from Lactococcus lactis (PepX) with its human counterpart DPP-IV. Despite very different overall folds, the residues most implicated for X-PDAP activity are conserved in the same positions and orientations in both enzymes, thus defining a structural signature for the X-PDAP specificity that crosses the species frontiers of evolution. Starting from this observation, we tested some inhibitors of DPP-IV on PepX activity, for which no specific inhibitor is known. We thus found that PepX was highly sensitive to valine-pyrrolidide with a KI of 9.3 microm, close to that reported in DPP-IV inhibition. We finally used the structure of PepX from L. lactis as a template for computer-based homology modeling of PepX from the pathogenic Streptococcus gordonii. Docking simulations of valine-pyrrolidide into the active site of PepX led to the identification of key residues for a rational drug design against PepX from Streptococci. These results could have applications in human health giving new perspectives to the struggle against pathogens.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In our continued effort to search for a Streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of S. suis type 2. A clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. Analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized within a 2.0-kbp EcoRI DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kDa. By in vitro protein synthesis and Western blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kDa. At the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from Streptococcus pneumoniae (89%), Streptococcus mutans (86%), Lactococcus lactis (80%), Listeria monocytogenes (74%), and Clostridium perfringens (64%). Except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, Southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in strains of other S. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the EcoRI recognition sequence. We confirmed expression of the 38-kDa protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most S. suis infections. Pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kDa protein mounted antibody responses to the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of S. suis type 2, suggesting that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against S. suis infection. Analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by Western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. The functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic S. suis capsular types remains to be determined.
TI  - Characterization of the cro-ori region of the Streptococcus thermophilus virulent bacteriophage DT1.
AB  - The virulent cos-type Streptococcus thermophilus phage DT1 was previously isolated from a mozzarella whey sample, and its complete genomic sequence is available. The putative ori of phage DT1 is characterized by three inverted and two direct repeats located in a noncoding region between orf36 and orf37. As the replication ability of the putative ori and flanking genes could not be established, its ability to confer phage resistance was tested. When ori is cloned on a high-copy-number plasmid, it provides protection to S. thermophilus strains against phage infection during milk fermentation. This protection is phage specific and strain dependent. Then, a detailed transcriptional map was established for the region located between the cro-like gene (orf29) and the ori. The results of the Northern blots indicated that the transcription of this region started 5 min after the onset of phage infection. Comparative analysis of the expression of the cro-ori region in the three S. thermophilus cos-type phages DT1, Sfi19 (virulent), and Sfi21 (temperate) reveals significant differences in the number and size of transcripts. The promoter upstream of orf29 was further investigated by primer extension analysis, and its activity was confirmed by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which showed that the phage promoter is more efficient than the constitutive bacterial promoter of the S. thermophilus operon encoding the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. However, the phage promoter is less efficient than the pts promoter in Lactococcus lactis and in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Differential binding specificities of oral streptococcal antigen I/II family adhesins for human or bacterial ligands.
AB  - The antigen I/II (AgI/II) family polypeptides, ranging from 1310 to 1653 amino acid (aa) residues, are cell wall anchored adhesins expressed by most indigenous species of oral streptococci. The polypeptides interact with a wide range of host molecules, in particular salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (SAG or gp340), and with ligands on other oral bacteria. To determine the receptor recognition properties of six different AgI/II family polypeptides from strains of Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus intermedius and Streptococcus mutans, the genes were cloned and expressed on the surface of the surrogate host Lactococcus lactis. The S. gordonii SspA and SspB polypeptides mediated higher binding levels of L. lactis cells to surface immobilized gp340 than did S. intermedius Pas protein, or S. mutans SpaP or PAc proteins. However, the AgI/II proteins were all similar in their abilities to mediate aggregation of lactococci by fluid phase gp340. The SpaP(I) polypeptide from S. mutans Ingbritt, which was C-terminally truncated by approximately 400 aa residues, did not bind gp340. Lactococci expressing AgI/II proteins, including SpaP(I), were aggregated by a synthetic 16 aa residue peptide SRCRP2 derived from the aa repeat block sequences within gp340. In coaggregation assays, SspB from S. gordonii was unique in mediating coaggregation with only group A and group E strains of Actinomyces naeslundii. All the other AgI/II polypeptides mediated coaggregation with group C and group D strains of A. naeslundii. Analysis of chimeric protein constructs revealed that coaggregation specificity was determined by sequences within the N-terminal half of AgI/II protein. A synthetic peptide (20 aa residues), which defines a putative adhesion epitope within the C-terminal region of polypeptide, inhibited AgI/II-mediated aggregation by gp340 but did not affect coaggregation with A. naeslundii. These results suggest that different mechanisms operate in interactions of AgI/II family polypeptides with native gp340, gp340 SRCR domain peptide, and A. naeslundii. Specificity of these interactions appears to be determined by discontinuous but interacting regions of the polypeptides, thus providing flexibility in receptor recognition for streptococcal colonization of the human host.
TI  - The putative autolysin regulator LytR in Streptococcus mutans plays a role in cell division and is growth-phase regulated.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is the primary odontopathogen present in supragingival plaque and causes the oral disease known as dental caries. Colonization of the oral cavity by S. mutans requires the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and occurs by both sucrose-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Sucrose-independent adhesion of S. mutans in vitro has been shown to involve an ORF (ORF0317) encoding a homologue (39 %) to LytR, a regulator of autolysin activity in Bacillus subtilis. The protein encoded by ORF0317, LytR, belongs to the LytR/CpsA/Psr protein family. This family has a putative role in cell-wall structural maintenance, possibly through autolysin regulation. Autolysins have also been shown to be important in surface adhesion in Lactococcus lactis and in the pathogenic properties of Streptococcus pneumoniae. To investigate the role of autolysins in the adhesion and pathogenesis of S. mutans, a LytR mutant was constructed. The mutant grows in long chains, which may indicate a defect in cell division. Further experiments with the mutant strain show increased autolytic activity, indicating that LytR attenuates S. mutans autolytic activity, possibly through regulation of the expression of autolytic enzymes. No defect in cell-to-surface adherence or biofilm growth was seen in the LytR mutant. However, a connection between cell growth phase and transcription of lytR was found.
TI  - Genetic analysis of a unique bacteriocin, Smb, produced by Streptococcus mutans GS5.
AB  - A dipeptide lantibiotic, named Smb, in Streptococcus mutans GS5 was characterized by molecular genetic approaches. The Smb biosynthesis gene locus is encoded by a 9.5-kb region of chromosomal DNA and consists of seven genes in the order smbM1, -T, -F, -M2, -G, -A, -B. This operon is not present in some other strains of S. mutans, including strain UA159. The genes encoding Smb were identified as smbA and smbB. Inactivation of smbM1, smbA, or smbB attenuated the inhibition of the growth of the indicator strain RP66, confirming an essential role for these genes in Smb expression. Mature Smb likely consists of the 30-amino-acid SmbA together with the 32-amino-acid SmbB. SmbA exhibited similarity with the mature lantibiotic lacticinA2 from Lactococcus lactis, while SmbB was similar to the mersacidin-like peptides from Bacillus halodurans and L. lactis. We also demonstrated that Smb expression is induced by the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) and that a com box-like sequence is located in the smb promoter region. These results suggest that Smb belongs to the class I bacteriocin family, and its expression is dependent on CSP-induced quorum sensing.
TI  - Bacteriophage defense systems and strategies for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - The fibrinogen receptor FbsA promotes adherence of Streptococcus agalactiae to human epithelial cells.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in human neonates. During the course of infection, S. agalactiae adheres to a variety of epithelial cells but the underlying mechanisms are only poorly understood. The present report demonstrates the importance of the fibrinogen receptor FbsA for the streptococcal adherence and invasion of epithelial cells. Deletion of the fbsA gene in various S. agalactiae strains substantially reduced their binding of soluble fibrinogen and their adherence to and invasion of epithelial cells, indicating a role of FbsA in these different processes. The adherence and invasiveness of an fbsA deletion mutant were partially restored by reintroducing the fbsA gene on an expression vector. Heterologous expression of fbsA in Lactococcus lactis enabled this bacterium to adhere to but not to invade epithelial cells, suggesting that FbsA is a streptococcal adhesin. Flow cytometry experiments revealed a dose-dependent binding of FbsA to the surface of epithelial cells. Furthermore, tissue culture experiments exhibited an intimate contact of FbsA-coated latex beads with the surfaces of human epithelial cells. Finally, host cell adherence and invasion were significantly blocked in competition experiments with either purified FbsA protein or a monoclonal antibody directed against the fibrinogen-binding epitope of FbsA. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that FbsA promotes the adherence of S. agalactiae to epithelial cells but that FbsA does not mediate the bacterial invasion into host cells. Our results also indicate that fibrinogen-binding epitopes within FbsA are involved in the adherence of S. agalactiae to epithelial cells.
TI  - FbsA, a fibrinogen-binding protein from Streptococcus agalactiae, mediates platelet aggregation.
AB  - The bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae is an etiologic agent in the pathogenesis  of endocarditis in humans. FbsA, a fibrinogen-binding protein produced by this pathogen, is considered an important virulence factor. In the present study we provide evidence that S agalactiae clinical isolates bearing FbsA attach to fibrinogen and elicit a fibrinogen-dependent aggregation of platelets. Mutants of S agalactiae lacking the fbsA gene lost the ability to attach to fibrinogen and to aggregate platelets. Plasmid-mediated expression of fbsA restored the capability for fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation in S agalactiae fbsA mutants, and allowed Lactococcus lactis to interact with fibrinogen and to aggregate human platelets. Moreover, a monoclonal anti-FbsA antibody inhibited bacterial adherence to fibrinogen and S agalactiae-induced platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation was inhibited by aspirin, prostaglandin E(1,) the peptide RGDS, and the antibody abciximab, demonstrating the specificity of platelet aggregation by S agalactiae and indicating an involvement of integrin glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in the induction of platelet aggregation. Aggregation was also dependent on anti-FbsA IgG and could be inhibited by an antibody against the platelet FcgammaRIIA receptor. These findings indicate that FbsA is a crucial factor in S agalactiae-induced platelet aggregation and may therefore play an important role in S agalactiae-induced endocarditis.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Use of tuf sequences for genus-specific PCR detection and phylogenetic analysis of 28 streptococcal species.
AB  - A 761-bp portion of the tuf gene (encoding the elongation factor Tu) from 28 clinically relevant streptococcal species was obtained by sequencing amplicons generated using broad-range PCR primers. These tuf sequences were used to select Streptococcus-specific PCR primers and to perform phylogenetic analysis. The specificity of the PCR assay was verified using 102 different bacterial species, including the 28 streptococcal species. Genomic DNA purified from all streptococcal species was efficiently detected, whereas there was no amplification with DNA from 72 of the 74 nonstreptococcal bacterial species tested. There was cross-amplification with DNAs from Enterococcus durans and Lactococcus lactis. However, the 15 to 31% nucleotide sequence divergence in the 761-bp tuf portion of these two species compared to any streptococcal tuf sequence provides ample sequence divergence to allow the development of internal probes specific to streptococci. The Streptococcus-specific assay was highly sensitive for all 28 streptococcal species tested (i.e., detection limit of 1 to 10 genome copies per PCR). The tuf sequence data was also used to perform extensive phylogenetic analysis, which was generally in agreement with phylogeny determined on the basis of 16S rRNA gene data. However, the tuf gene provided a better discrimination at the streptococcal species level that should be particularly useful for the identification of very closely related species. In conclusion, tuf appears more suitable than the 16S ribosomal RNA gene for the development of diagnostic assays for the detection and identification of streptococcal species because of its higher level of species-specific genetic divergence.
TI  - Biosurfactant from Lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  - The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, Candida albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. This study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Immobilized lactic acid bacteria for application as dairy starters and probiotic  preparations.
AB  
TI  - Influence of biosurfactants from probiotic bacteria on formation of biofilms on voice prostheses.
AB  - Biofilms were grown on preconditioned voice prostheses with biosurfactants obtained from probiotic bacteria Lactococcus lactis 53 and Streptococcus thermophilus A in an artificial throat model. Both biosurfactants greatly reduced microbial numbers on prostheses and also induced a decrease in the airflow resistance that occurs on voice prostheses after biofilm formation. This study presents a promising strategy for prolonging the lifespan of voice prostheses.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Enhancement of 2-methylbutanal formation in cheese by using a fluorescently tagged Lacticin 3147 producing Lactococcus lactis strain.
AB  - The amino acid conversion to volatile compounds by lactic acid bacteria is important for aroma formation in cheese. In this work, we analyzed the effect of the lytic bacteriocin Lacticin 3147 on transamination of isoleucine and further formation of the volatile compound 2-methylbutanal in cheese. The Lacticin 3147 producing strain Lactococcus lactis IFPL3593 was fluorescently tagged (IFPL3593-GFP) by conjugative transfer of the plasmid pMV158GFP from Streptococcus pneumoniae, and used as starter in cheese manufacture. Starter adjuncts were the bacteriocin-sensitive strains L. lactis T1 and L. lactis IFPL730, showing branched chain amino acid aminotransferase and alpha-keto acid decarboxylase activity, respectively. Adjunct strains were selected to complete the isoleucine conversion pathway and, hence, increase formation of 2-methylbutanal conferring aroma to the cheese. The non-bacteriocin-producing strain L. lactis IFPL359-GFP was included as starter in the control batch. Fluorescent tagging of the starter strains allowed their tracing in cheese during ripening by fluorescence microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy. The bacteriocin produced by L. lactis IFPL3593-GFP enhanced lysis of the adjuncts with a concomitant increase in isoleucine transamination and about a two-fold increase of the derived volatile compound 2-methylbutanal. This led to an enhancement of the cheese aroma detected by a sensory panel. The improvement of cheese flavour and aroma may be of significant importance for the dairy industry.
TI  - Mucosal vaccine made from live, recombinant Lactococcus lactis protects mice against pharyngeal infection with Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A novel vaccine (LL-CRR) made from live, nonpathogenic Lactococcus lactis that expresses the conserved C-repeat region (CRR) of M protein from Streptococcus pyogenes serotype 6 was tested in mice. Nasally vaccinated mice produced CRR-specific salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG. Subcutaneously vaccinated mice produced CRR-specific serum IgG but not salivary IgA. A combined regimen produced responses similar to the salivary IgA of nasally vaccinated mice and serum IgG of subcutaneously vaccinated mice. Mice vaccinated nasally or with the combined regimen were significantly protected against pharyngeal infection following a nasal challenge with S. pyogenes M serotype 14. Mice vaccinated subcutaneously were not protected against pharyngeal infection. Mice in all three LL-CRR vaccination groups were significantly protected against the lethal effects of S. pyogenes. Only 1 of 77 challenged mice that were vaccinated with LL-CRR died, whereas 60 of 118 challenged mice that were vaccinated with a control strain or phosphate-buffered saline died. In conclusion, mucosal vaccination with LL-CRR produced CRR-specific salivary IgA and serum IgG, prevented pharyngeal infection with S. pyogenes, and promoted survival.
TI  - Attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  - Candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, Thermotogales and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. This allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. In particular, orthologs of ygeA of Escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. Three new families of histidine transporters were predicted, orthologs of yuiF and yvsH of Bacillus subtilis, and lysQ of Lactococcus lactis. In Pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thrA was predicted to be regulated not only by threonine and isoleucine, as in E. coli, but also by methionine. In alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvIH was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. Histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in Bacillus cereus and Clostridium difficile, and by histidine T-boxes in L. lactis and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 10140: identification of the atp (atpBEFHAGDC) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  - The atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16S rRNA gene. PCR primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpD gene to amplify partial atpD sequences from 12 Bifidobacterium species and nine Lactobacillus species. All PCR products were sequenced and aligned with other atpD sequences retrieved from public databases. Genes encoding the subunits of the F(1)F(0)-ATPase of Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 10140 (atpBEFHAGDC) were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. We identified specific sequence signatures for the genus Bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. Northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpC, atpD, atpG, and atpA genes. The transcription initiation sites of these two mRNAs were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the atpD genes demonstrated that the Lactobacillus atpD gene clustered with the genera Listeria, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus and that the higher G+C content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there was probably horizontal gene transfer. The acid inducibility of the atp operon of B. lactis DSM 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using RNA isolated from acid-treated cultures of B. lactis DSM 10140. The rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low pH suggested that the ATPase complex of B. lactis DSM 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.
TI  - Indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  - Nostrano di Primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park area in the Italian Dolomites. In summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, Passo Rolle and Vanoi, in the Paneveggio Natural Park. During the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. The microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by RAPD analysis and identified by 16S rRNA sequence. The milk of the Passo Rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic Streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the Vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei. The plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. The dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. Moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. The Vanoi cheese was dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus macedonicus in the first two days and mesophilic 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. In the first few days, the Rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic S. macedonicus and S. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. During ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. The taxonomical identification by 16S rRNA sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of S. macedonicus, Lactobacillus plantarum, 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum and E. faecium were detected in both cheeses.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression among low G+C gram-positive genomes.
AB  - We present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes in the low G+C Gram-positive genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Clostridium perfringens. Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.
TI  - The prophages of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.
AB  - Two non-inducible, but apparently complete prophages were identified in the genome of the sequenced Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC 533. The 38- and 40-kb-long prophages Lj928 and Lj965 represent distinct lineages of Sfi11-like pac-site Siphoviridae unrelated at the DNA sequence level. The deduced structural proteins from Lj928 demonstrated aa sequence identity with Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1, while Lj965 shared sequence links with Streptococcus thermophilus phage O1205. With the exception of tRNA genes, inserted between DNA replication and DNA packaging genes, the transcription of the prophage was restricted to the genome segments near both attachment sites. Transcribed genes unrelated to phage functions were inserted between the phage repressor and integrase genes; one group of genes shared sequence relatedness with a mobile DNA element in Staphylococcus aureus. A short, but highly transcribed region was located between the phage lysin and right attachment site; it lacked a protein-encoding function in one prophage.
TI  - Controlled autolysis and enzyme release in a recombinant lactococcal strain expressing the metalloendopeptidase enterolysin A.
AB  - This study concerns the exploitation of the lytic enzyme enterolysin A (EntL), produced by Enterococcus faecalis strain DPC5280, to elicit the controlled autolysis of starter lactococci. EntL, a cell wall metalloendopeptidase secreted by some E. faecalis strains, can kill a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including lactococci. The controlled expression of entL, which encodes EntL, was achieved using a nisin-inducible expression system in a lactococcal host. Zymographic analysis of EntL activity demonstrated that active enzyme is produced by the recombinant lactococcal host. Indeed, expression of EntL resulted in almost complete autolysis of the host strain 2 h after induction with nisin. Model cheese experiments using a starter strain in addition to the inducible enterolysin-producing strain showed a 27-fold increase in activity with respect to the release of lactate dehydrogenase in the strain overexpressing EntL, demonstrating the potential of EntL production in large-scale cheese production systems. Indeed, the observation that a wide range of lactic bacteria are sensitive to EntL suggests that EntL-induced autolysis has potential applications with a variety of lactic acid bacteria and could be a basis for probiotic delivery systems.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the Lactococcus lactis temperate phage phiLC3: comparative analysis of phiLC3 and its relatives in lactococci and streptococci.
AB  - Complete genome sequencing of the P335 temperate Lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phiLC3 (32, 172 bp) revealed fifty-one open reading frames (ORFs). Four ORFs did not show any homology to other proteins in the database and twenty-one ORFs were assigned a putative biological function. phiLC3 contained a unique replication module and orf201 was identified as the putative replication initiator protein-encoding gene. phiLC3 was closely related to the L. lactis r1t phage (73% DNA identity). Similarity was also shared with other lactococcal P335 phages and the Streptococcus pyogenes prophages 370.3, 8232.4 and 315.5 over the non-structural genes and the genes involved in DNA packaging/phage morphogenesis, respectively. phiLC3 contained small homologous regions distributed among lactococcal phages suggesting that these regions might be involved in mediating genetic exchange. Two regions of 30 and 32 bp were conserved among the streptococcal and lactococcal r1t-like phages. These two regions, as well as other homologous regions, were located at mosaic borders and close to putative transcriptional terminators indicating that such regions together might attract recombination. The conserved regions found among lactococcal and streptococcal phages might be used for identification of phages/prophages/prophage remnants in their hosts.
TI  - Changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  - Whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. During this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. This study surveyed industry samples of Cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees C) and abuse (37.8 degrees C) temperatures. Samples stored at 4 degrees C did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. Mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees C. Whey samples derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. Starter cultures evaluated included Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Whey derived from L. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees C as compared with the other cultures. Galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from L. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees C in comparison with the other cultures. Results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees C) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees C varies depending on the culture(s) used in cheese production.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the Streptococcus salivarius methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP).
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) was purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing the S. salivarius map gene, which codes for MetAP. S. salivarius map coded for a protein of 286 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31,723 Da and a pI of 4.6. The native enzyme eluted from a Superdex column as a protein with a molecular mass of 30.6 kDa and cleaved N-terminal Met of peptide only when the penultimate amino acid was Gly, Ala, Ser, Val, Pro, or Thr. The enzyme was more active against tetrapeptides than tripeptides and did not recognize dipeptides. It required the presence of a metal cation for activity, with a preference for Co(2+) over Mn(2+). S. salivarius MetAP has a pH optimum of 8.0 and an optimal temperature at 50 degrees C. The S. salivarius protein had an extra sequence of 24 amino acids between two conserved aspartate residues involved in the coordination of the metal ion. A similar extra sequence is present in MetAP from other streptococci and from Lactococcus lactis, but not from other bacteria or eukaryotes.
TI  - Multiple competitive PCR-DGGE as a tool for quantifying and profiling defined mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria during production of probiotics from complex polysaccharides.
AB  - AIMS: To apply a denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (DGGE) method to quantify and profile individual strains during a mixed culture fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was extracted during the culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and amplified in a multiple competitive PCR (cPCR) using general primers targeting 16S rDNA and DNA from Streptococcus salivarius as competitive DNA. Subsequently the 200-kb amplified fragments were separated by DGGE. The method was validated in pure cultures and used to profile a mixture of three LAB grown on glucose, soluble starch and glycogen from mussel processing waste. The inclusion of a starch- and glycogen-degrading strain (Lactobacillus plantarum) and a weakly amylotic nisin-resistant strain (Lact. paracasei) allowed proliferation of the nisin producing Lactococcus lactis which in itself is unable to grow on complex carbohydrates. cPCR-DGGE permitted the monitoring of a different strain succession on the different carbohydrates, related to amylolytic activity and substrate consumption, acid production and nisin production. CONCLUSIONS: cPCR-DGGE is a useful tool for profiling defined mixed cultures of bacteria and hence allows their interaction to be studied. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Provided validation of the method for each specific case, it may be appropriate to monitor and control the reproducibility of any defined mixed culture of bacteria, with the advantage that an increase in the strain numbers to be monitored does not yield an increase in the labour of the procedure.
TI  - Genomic organization and molecular characterization of SM1, a temperate bacteriophage of Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The direct binding of Streptococcus mitis to human platelets is mediated in part  by two proteins (PblA and PblB) encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage (SM1). Since SM1 is the first prophage of S. mitis that has been identified and because of the possible role of these phage-encoded proteins in virulence, we sought to characterize SM1 in greater detail. Sequencing of the SM1 genome revealed that it consisted of 34,692 bp, with an overall G+C content of 39 mol%. Fifty-six genes encoding proteins of 40 or more amino acids were identified. The genes of SM1 appear to be arranged in a modular, life cycle-specific organization. BLAST analysis also revealed that the proteins of SM1 have homologies to proteins from a wide variety of lambdoid phages. Bioinformatic analyses, in addition to N-terminal sequencing of the proteins, led to the assignment of possible functions to a number of proteins, including the integrase, the terminase, and two major structural proteins. Examination of the phage structural components indicates that the phage head may assemble using stable multimers of the major capsid protein, in a process similar to that of phage r1t. These findings indicate that SM1 may be part of a discrete subfamily of the Siphoviridae that includes at least phages r1t of Lactococcus lactis and SF370.3 of Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - A potential food-grade cloning vector for Streptococcus thermophilus that uses cadmium resistance as the selectable marker.
AB  - A potential food-grade cloning vector, pND919, was constructed and transformed into S. thermophilus ST3-1, a plasmid-free strain. The vector contains DNAs from two different food-approved organisms, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The 5.0-kb pND919 is a derivative of the cloning vector pND918 (9.3 kb) and was constructed by deletion of the 4.3-kb region of pND918 which contained DNA from non-food-approved organisms. pND919 carries a heterologous native cadmium resistance selectable marker from L. lactis M71 and expresses the Cd(r) phenotype in S. thermophilus transformants. With the S. thermophilus replicon derived from the shuttle vector pND913, pND919 is able to replicate in the two S. thermophilus industrial strains tested, ST3-1 and ST4-1. Its relatively high retention rate in S. thermophilus further indicates its usefulness as a potential food-grade cloning vector. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a replicative potential food-grade vector for the industrially important organism S. thermophilus.
TI  - M1 protein triggers a phosphoinositide cascade for group A Streptococcus invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  - Invasion of nonphagocytic cells by bacteria provides a favorable niche for persistence and evasion of host defenses and antibiotics. M protein is a major virulence factor because it promotes high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells by group A Streptococcus (GAS) and also renders the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. In this study, we investigated the role of M1 protein from serotype M1 strain 90-226 in regulating mammalian signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement for bacterial entry. LY294002 and wortmannin, which are inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) blocked invasion of epithelial cells by GAS by 75 and 80%, respectively, but failed to inhibit invasion by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Also, epithelial cells transiently transfected with dominant negative p85 and p110 genes, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PI 3-K, respectively, were less able to be invaded by GAS. To separate the influence of other streptococcal virulence factors from M protein, Lactococcus lactis was engineered to express M1 protein on its surface. L. lactis(pLM1) invaded epithelial cells efficiently in vitro, and PI 3-K inhibitors blocked 90% of this invasion. Purified soluble M1 protein stimulated the formation of stress fibers and actin tuffs on epithelial cells. LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited these cellular changes. A phosphoinositide analogue also inhibited the invasion of epithelial cells by GAS. Therefore, M1 protein, either directly or via bound fibronectin, initiates signals that depend on the lipid kinase PI 3-K pathway, which paves the way for cytoskeletal rearrangement that internalize the bacterium.
TI  - Effect of acidic pH on expression of surface-associated proteins of Streptococcus oralis.
AB  - Streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. We undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of S. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. Surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. The most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein HPr, was present as three isoforms. Neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. Eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at pH 5.2 versus pH 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase V from Lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors G, Tu, and Ts. This study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. Further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.
TI  - PH-sensing 96-well microtitre plates for the characterization of acid production  by dairy starter cultures.
AB  - A new method for characterization of acid production by dairy starter cultures is presented. Microplates with integrated optical pH sensors are developed. Two fluorophores, a pH-sensitive and a pH-insensitive one are immobilised at the bottom of a polystyrene 96-well microtitre plate. The pH-insensitive fluorophore serves as an internal reference and makes calibration unnecessary. The sensor measures pH accurately in optically well-defined media. Particles and fluorophores contained in the bulk medium disturbed the measurements. Despite these disturbances it was possible to clearly sense differences in inoculum type and in inoculum sizes of cultures of Lactococcus lactis and of Streptococcus thermophilus at 30 and 37 degrees C. Besides a pH-related signal there is information about other changes during milk fermentation. The cultivation results were compared with those from the established CINAC-method. From this comparison it can be concluded that the new method can be used reliably to characterize particularly a large number of strains for screening purposes but also for quality control.
TI  - Effects of cultivation conditions on folate production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A variety of lactic acid bacteria were screened for their ability to produce folate intracellularly and/or extracellularly. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc spp. all produced folate, while most Lactobacillus spp., with the exception of Lactobacillus plantarum, were not able to produce folate. Folate production was further investigated in L. lactis as a model organism for metabolic engineering and in S. thermophilus for direct translation to (dairy) applications. For both these two lactic acid bacteria, an inverse relationship was observed between growth rate and folate production. When cultures were grown at inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics or salt or when the bacteria were subjected to low growth rates in chemostat cultures, folate levels in the cultures were increased relative to cell mass and (lactic) acid production. S. thermophilus excreted more folate than L. lactis, presumably as a result of differences in the number of glutamyl residues of the folate produced. In S. thermophilus 5,10-methenyl and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate were detected as the major folate derivatives, both containing three glutamyl residues, while in L. lactis 5,10-methenyl and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate were found, both with either four, five, or six glutamyl residues. Excretion of folate was stimulated at lower pH in S. thermophilus, but pH had no effect on folate excretion by L. lactis. Finally, several environmental parameters that influence folate production in these lactic acid bacteria were observed; high external pH increased folate production and the addition of p-aminobenzoic acid stimulated folate production, while high tyrosine concentrations led to decreased folate biosynthesis.
TI  - Application of the shsp gene, encoding a small heat shock protein, as a food-grade selection marker for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Plasmid pSt04 of Streptococcus thermophilus contains a gene encoding a protein with homology to small heat shock proteins (A. Geis, H. A. M. El Demerdash, and K. J. Heller, Plasmid 50:53-69, 2003). Strains cured from the shsp plasmids showed significantly reduced heat and acid resistance and a lower maximal growth temperature. Transformation of the cloned shsp gene into S. thermophilus St11 lacking a plasmid encoding shsp resulted in increased resistance to incubation at 60 degrees C or pH 3.5 and in the ability to grow at 52 degrees C. A food-grade cloning system for S. thermophilus, based on the plasmid-encoded shsp gene as a selection marker, was developed. This approach allowed selection after transfer of native and recombinant shsp plasmids into different S. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis strains. Using a recombinant plasmid carrying an erythromycin resistance (Em(r)) gene in addition to shsp, we demonstrated that both markers are equally efficient in selecting for plasmid-bearing cells. The average transformation rates in S. thermophilus (when we were selecting for heat resistance) were determined to be 2.4 x 10(4) and 1.0 x 10(4) CFU/0.5 micro g of DNA, with standard deviations of 0.54 x 10(4) and 0.32 x 10(4), for shsp and Em(r) selection, respectively. When we selected for pH resistance, the average transformation rates were determined to be 2.25 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(3) CFU/0.5 micro g of DNA, with standard deviations of 0.63 x 10(4) and 3.48 x 10(3), for shsp and Em(r) selection, respectively. The applicability of shsp as a selection marker was further demonstrated by constructing S. thermophilus plasmid pHRM1 carrying the shsp gene as a selection marker and the restriction-modification genes of another S. thermophilus plasmid as a functional trait.
TI  - Microbial and physiological characterization of weakly amylolytic but fast-growing lactic acid bacteria: a functional role in supporting microbial diversity in pozol, a Mexican fermented maize beverage.
AB  - Pozol is an acid beverage obtained from the natural fermentation of nixtamal (heat- and alkali-treated maize) dough. The concentration of mono- and disaccharides from maize is reduced during nixtamalization, so that starch is the main carbohydrate available for lactic acid fermentation. In order to provide some basis to understand the role of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria (ALAB) in this fermented food, their diversity and physiological characteristics were determined. Forty amylolytic strains were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Four different biotypes were distinguished via ribotyping; Streptococcus bovis strains were found to be predominant. Streptococcus macedonicus, Lactococcus lactis, and Enterococcus sulfureus strains were also identified. S. bovis strain 25124 showed extremely low amylase yield relative to biomass (139 U g [cell dry weight](-1)) and specific rate of amylase production (130.7 U g [cell dry weight](-1) h(-1)). In contrast, it showed a high specific growth rate (0.94 h(-1)) and an efficient energy conversion yield to bacterial cell biomass (0.31 g of biomass g of substrate(-1)). These would confer on the strain a competitive advantage and are the possible reasons for its dominance. Transient accumulation of maltooligosaccharides during fermentation could presumably serve as energy sources for nonamylolytic species in pozol fermentation. This would explain the observed diversity and the dominance of nonamylolytic lactic acid bacteria at the end of fermentation. These results are the first step to understanding the importance of ALAB during pozol fermentation.
TI  - Pediocin production by recombinant lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Production of the anti-listerial bacteriocin, pediocin, by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformed with the cloning vector pPC418 (Ped+, 9.1 kb) was influenced by composition of media and incubation temperature. Maximum pediocin production, tested against Listeria innocua, by electrotransformants of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis was measured in tryptone/lactose/yeast extract medium after 24 h growth at 30 degrees C, while incubation at 40 degrees C was optimum for Ped+ transformants of Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis. The amount of pediocin produced by S. thermophilus in skim milk and cheese whey supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract was estimated as 51,000 units ml(-1) and 25,000 units ml(-1), respectively. Pediocin production remained essentially unchanged in reconstituted skim milk or whey media diluted up to 10-fold. The results demonstrate the capacity of recombinant strains of LAB to produce pediocin in a variety of growth media including skim milk and inexpensive cheese whey-based media, requiring minimum nutritional supplementation.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin Salers cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  - Microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin Salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in France, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. The aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of RDO Salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. This included DNA extraction, PCR, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Bacterial and high-GC% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify V2 or V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. SSCP patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. Patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. Bacteria belonging to the high-GC% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. The present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of plasmids from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of eight plasmids isolated from seven Streptococcus thermophilus strains have been determined. Plasmids pSt04, pER1-1, and pJ34 are related and replicate via a rolling circle mechanism. Plasmid pJ34 encodes for a replication initiation protein (RepA) and a small polypeptide with unknown function. Plasmids pSt04 and pER1-1 carry in addition to repA genes coding for small heat shock proteins (sHsp). Expression of these proteins is induced at elevated temperatures or low pH and increases the thermo- and acid resistance. Plasmids pER1-2 and pSt22-2 show identical sequences with five putative open reading frames (ORFs). The gene products of ORF1 and ORF4 reveal some similarities to transposon encoded proteins of Bacillus subtilis and Tn916. ORF1 of plasmid pSt106 encodes a protein similar to resolvases of different Gram-positive bacteria. Integrity of ORF2 and 3, encoding a putative DNA primase and a replication protein, is essential for replication. ORF1 to 3 of plasmid pSt08, which are organized in a tricistronic operon, encode a RepA protein, an adenosine-specific methyltransferase, and a type II restriction endonuclease. Another type II restriction-modification (R/M) system is encoded on plasmid pSt0 which is highly similar to those encoded on lactococcal plasmid pHW393 and B. subtilis plasmid pXH13. Plasmid-free derivatives of strains St0 and St08 show increased phage sensitivity, indicating that in the wild-type strains the R/M systems are functionally expressed. Recombinant plasmids based on the replicons of plasmids pSt04, pJ34, pSt106, pSt08, and pSt0, are able to replicate in Lactococcus lactis and B. subtilis, respectively, whereas constructs carrying pER1-2 only replicate in S. thermophilus.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Construction of the mobilizable plasmid pMV158GFP, a derivative of pMV158 that carries the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein.
AB  - Plasmid pMV158 has been employed to construct cloning non-mobilizable vectors for various Gram-positive organisms. Here we report the construction of a mobilizable pMV158-based plasmid that harbors the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein under the control of a promoter inducible by maltose. The plasmid was mobilized between strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as from S. pneumoniae to Lactococcus lactis or Enterococcus faecalis at the same frequency as its parental. Transconjugant that received the GFP-tagged plasmid could be detected by their fluorescence, which was especially high in E. faecalis cells.
TI  - Cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  - The C-terminal region (cA) of the major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (LysM domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. The cA domain could be deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. This AcmA derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete. The cA domain and a chimeric protein consisting of cA fused to the C terminus of MSA2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via cA. The fusion protein also bound to many other Gram-positive bacteria. By chemical treatment of purified cell walls of L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with cA. Immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, B. subtilis, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus casei cells. Based on these studies, we propose that LysM-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of AcmA. Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed.
TI  - 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region polymorphism of Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis and Lactococcus lactis as revealed by PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis.
AB  - The intergenic spacer region (ISR) between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes was tested  as a tool for differentiating lactococci commonly isolated in a dairy environment. 17 reference strains, representing 11 different species belonging to the genera Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Leuconostoc, and 127 wild streptococcal strains isolated during the whole fermentation process of "Fior di Latte" cheese were analyzed. After 16S-23S rDNA ISR amplification by PCR, species or genus-specific patterns were obtained for most of the reference strains tested. Moreover, results obtained after nucleotide analysis show that the 16S-23S rDNA ISR sequences vary greatly, in size and sequence, among Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis as well as other streptococci from dairy environments. Because of the high degree of inter-specific polymorphism observed, 16S-23S rDNA ISR can be considered a good potential target for selecting species-specific molecular assays, such as PCR primer or probes, for a rapid and extremely reliable differentiation of dairy lactococcal isolates.
TI  - Feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations Actimel and Indian Dahi.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. The design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the Delhi University College Hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre Nand Nagri, a resettlement colony in East Delhi. Children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. Group 1 was given a fermented milk, Actimel, containing 10(8) of each Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per gram. Group 2 was given Indian Dahi (Lf 40) containing 10(8) of each Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus lactis cremoris and Leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. Group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). Actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. In the hospital study Indian Dahi and Actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3 and 0.6 day (P<0.001), respectively. The corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (P<0.05), respectively. The families using Actimel as a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. In conclusion, Actimel, fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, and Indian Dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.
TI  - [Part of biological activity of peptidoglycan from Streptococcus lactis SB900].
AB  - Peptidoglycan of Streptococcus lactis SB900(LABPG) was isolated. It's chemical composition was analyzed and part of biological activity was examined. The PG contained 9.84% protein, 0.871 mumol/m NAG, 1.14 mumol/mg NAM. The amino acids of relatively high concentrations were Ala, Glu, Asp and their concentrations were 1.046, 0.775, 0.304 mumol/mg respectively. Using mice as subject, the animal experiment confirmed that LABPG was non-toxic and safe. Effect of i.p. LABPG 0.5 mg/mouse on the phagocytic function were studied. It was suggested that the phagocytic activity of PM phi had markedly enhanced, the activity of serum lysozyme was increased significantly. YC-Rosette experiment suggested that the activity of C3b receptors of PM phi were increased and the YC-Rosette forming ratio were higher than controls. The difference was significant by statistical analysis. Therefore, it is considered that LABPG was able to activate M phi and improve immune function in mice.
TI  - Isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a Ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  - One hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from Uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. Isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using API 50 CHL kits and additional biochemical tests. Coliforms, yeasts and LAB were enumerated in bushera. The pH, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. The LAB counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). The coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). The pH of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. Ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. The initial numbers of LAB and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the LAB numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. LAB counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. Coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). Yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. The pH declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. Lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus genera. Tentatively, Lactobacillus isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. LAB isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus. Eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch and were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), Weissella confusa (one strain) and L. plantarum (one strain).
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria of kefir grains.
AB  - A Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with high exopolysaccharide activity was selected from among 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains. By associating the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with Streptococcus thermophilus T15, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C15, Lactobacillus helveticus MP12, and Sacharomyces cerevisiae A13, a kefir starter was formed. The associated cultivation of the lactobacteria and yeast had a positive effect on the exopolysaccharide activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1. The maximum exopolysaccharide concentration of the starter culture exceeded the one by the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 monoculture by approximately 1.7 times, and the time needed to reach the maximum concentration (824.3 mg exopolysacharides/l) was shortened by 6 h. The monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides from the kefir starter culture was represented by glucose and galactose in a 1.0:0.94 ratio, which proves that the polymer synthesized is kefiran.
TI  - Cell-wall proteinases PrtS and PrtB have a different role in Streptococcus thermophilus/Lactobacillus bulgaricus mixed cultures in milk.
AB  - The manufacture of yoghurt relies on the simultaneous utilization of two starters: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb. bulgaricus). A protocooperation usually takes place between the two species, which often results in enhanced milk acidification and aroma formation compared to pure cultures. Cell-wall proteinases of Lactococcus lactis and lactobacilli have been shown to be essential to growth in milk in pure cultures. In this study, the role of proteinases PrtS from S. thermophilus and PrtB from Lb. bulgaricus in bacterial growth in milk was evaluated; a negative mutant for the prtS gene of S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 was constructed for this purpose. Pure cultures of S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 and its PrtS-negative mutant were made in milk as well as mixed cultures of S. thermophilus and Lb. bulgaricus: S. thermophilus CNRZ 385 or its PrtS-negative mutant was associated with several strains of Lb. bulgaricus, including a PrtB-negative strain. The pH and growth of bacterial populations of the resulting mixed cultures were followed, and the Lactobacillus strain was found to influence both the extent of the benefit of Lb. bulgaricus/S. thermophilus association on milk acidification and the magnitude of S. thermophilus population dominance at the end of fermentation. In all mixed cultures, the sequential growth of S. thermophilus then of Lb. bulgarius and finally of both bacteria was observed. Although proteinase PrtS was essential to S. thermophilus growth in milk in pure culture, it had no effect on bacterial growth and thus on the final pH of mixed cultures in the presence of PrtB. In contrast, proteinase PrtB was necessary for the growth of S. thermophilus, and its absence resulted in a higher final pH. From these results, a model of growth of both bacteria in mixed cultures in milk is proposed.
TI  - Cloning vectors for Streptococcus thermophilus derived from a native plasmid.
AB  - A 3.5-kb native plasmid (pND103) was identified in Streptococcus thermophilus ST2-1. Preliminary sequence analysis indicated that pND103 belongs to group I S. thermophilus plasmids. A region of approximately 2 kb appears to contain three components: a plus origin of replication (ori) typical of plasmids that replicate via rolling circle replication; a gene encoding a replication protein (rep); and a gene encoding a small heat shock protein (hsp). pND103 was then used to construct S. thermophilus/Escherichia coli hybrid cloning vectors by ligating different portions of pND103 to an origin-probe vector (pND330) composed of pUC19 and a Gram-positive erythromycin resistance gene. The shuttle vectors (pND913, pND914 and pND915) were successfully introduced back into plasmid-free S. thermophilus ST3-1 as well as to Lactococcus lactis LM0230 and E. coli JM109. Segregational and structural stability study indicated that these vectors can be maintained in these hosts. The results indicated that pND913, pND914 and pND915 are potential shuttle cloning vectors for S. thermophilus.
TI  - Molecular characterization of cadmium resistance in Streptococcus thermophilus strain 4134: an example of lateral gene transfer.
AB  - Two genes (cadC(St) and cadA(St) [subscript St represents Streptococcus thermophilus]), located on the chromosome of S. thermophilus 4134, were shown to constitute a cadmium/zinc resistance cassette. The genes seem to be organized in an operon, and their transcription is cadmium dependent in vivo. The proposed product of the cadA open reading frame (CadA(St)) is highly similar to P-type cadmium efflux ATPases, whereas the predicted protein encoded by cadC(St) (CadC(St)) shows high similarity to ArsR-type regulatory proteins. The observed homologies and G+C content of this cassette and surrounding regions suggest that this DNA was derived from Lactococcus lactis and may have been introduced relatively recently into the S. thermophilus 4134 genome by a lateral gene transfer event. The complete cassette confers cadmium and zinc resistance to both S. thermophilus and L. lactis, but expression of cadA(St) alone is sufficient to give resistance. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays it was shown that the CadC(St) protein is a DNA binding protein that binds specifically to its own promoter region, possibly to two copies of an inverted repeat, and that this CadC(St)-DNA interaction is lost in the presence of cadmium. Using lacZ fusion constructs it was shown that the cadmium-dependent expression of CadA(St) is mediated by the negative regulator CadC(St). A model for the regulation of the expression of cadmium resistance in S. thermophilus is discussed.
TI  - The dilemma of phage taxonomy illustrated by comparative genomics of Sfi21-like Siphoviridae in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The complete genome sequences of two dairy phages, Streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201 and Lactobacillus casei phage A2, are reported. Comparative genomics reveals that both phages are members of the recently proposed Sfi21-like genus of Siphoviridae, a widely distributed phage type in low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. Graded relatedness, the hallmark of evolving biological systems, was observed when different Sfi21-like phages were compared. Across the structural module, the graded relatedness was represented by a high level of DNA sequence similarity or protein sequence similarity, or a shared gene map in the absence of sequence relatedness. This varying range of relatedness was found within Sfi21-like phages from a single species as demonstrated by the different prophages harbored by Lactococcus lactis strain IL1403. A systematic dot plot analysis with 11 complete L. lactis phage genome sequences revealed a clear separation of all temperate phages from two classes of virulent phages. The temperate lactococcal phages share DNA sequence homology in a patchwise fashion over the nonstructural gene cluster. With respect to structural genes, four DNA homology groups could be defined within temperate L. lactis phages. Closely related structural modules for all four DNA homology groups were detected in phages from Streptococcus or Listeria, suggesting that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages that have not uniquely evolved in L. lactis. It seems reasonable to base phage taxonomy on data from comparative genomics. However, the peculiar modular nature of phage evolution creates ambiguities in the definition of phage taxa by comparative genomics. For example, depending on the module on which the classification is based, temperate lactococcal phages can be classified as a single phage species, as four distinct phage species, or as two if not three different phage genera. We propose to base phage taxonomy on comparative genomics of a single structural gene module (head or tail genes). This partially phylogeny-based taxonomical system still mirrors some aspects of the current International Committee on Taxonomy in Virology classification system. In this system the currently sequenced lactococcal phages would be grouped into five genera: c2-, sk1, Sfi11-, r1t-, and Sfi21-like phages.
TI  - Utilization of tmRNA sequences for bacterial identification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ribosomal RNA molecules are widely used for phylogenetic and in situ  identification of bacteria. Nevertheless, their use to distinguish microorganisms within a species is often restricted by the high degree of sequence conservation and limited probe accessibility to the target in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To overcome these limitations, we examined the use of tmRNA for in situ identification. In E. coli, this stable 363 nucleotides long RNA is encoded by the ssrA gene, which is involved in the degradation of truncated proteins. RESULTS: Conserved sequences at the 5'- and 3'-ends of tmRNA genes were used to design universal primers that could amplify the internal part of ssrA from Gram-positive bacteria having low G+C content, i.e. genera Bacillus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Sequence analysis of tmRNAs showed that this molecule can be used for phylogenetic assignment of bacteria. Compared to 16S rRNA, the tmRNA nucleotide sequences of some bacteria, for example Listeria, display considerable divergence between species. Using E. coli as an example, we have shown that bacteria can be specifically visualized by FISH with tmRNA targeted probes. CONCLUSIONS: Features of tmRNA, including its presence in phylogenetically distant bacteria, conserved regions at gene extremities and a potential to serve as target for FISH, make this molecule a possible candidate for identification of bacteria.
TI  - Frequent oligonucleotide motifs in genomes of three streptococci.
AB  - Complete genomes of three closely related Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Lactococcus lactis are analyzed for abundances of short DNA sequence motifs (frequent words). The character and extent of frequent words are strikingly different among these genomes. The frequent words of S.pneumoniae split into three categories: parts of the previously characterized RUP and BOX repetitive elements and a 24 bp tandem repeat in the gene SP1772. The most abundant frequent words of L.lactis are all related to the 13 bp motif, WWNTTACTGACRR or its inverted complement YYGTCAGTAANWW. Distributional analysis of this motif, which we called highly repetitive motif (HRM), indicates its possible dual role. Frequent occurrences immediately downstream of genes suggest a possible role in transcription termination whereas spacings of consecutive HRMs consistent with the DNA helical period are indicative of a protein-binding site. Two regions of the L.lactis genome feature an intriguing pattern of several periodically occurring HRMs separated by precisely 59 bp. In a striking contrast to S.pneumoniae and L.lactis, S.pyogenes contains hardly any frequent words.
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - The evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  - The effectiveness of yeast extracts (YE) and potato extracts (PE) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (AS). Two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using ODmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) Eleven lots from the same PE-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. The ODmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. The growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% PE than in base medium containing 100% YE for both ODmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in PE. In AS assays, highest OD values for Lactobacillus casei EQ28, Lactobacillus rhamnosus R-011, Lactobacillus plantarum EQ12, and Streptococcus thermophilus R-083 were obtained with a mixture of PE and YE. Fermentations (2 L) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of AS to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. In these fermentations, replacement of 50% YE with PE was shown to enable good growth of S. thermophilus. With L. rhamnosus R-011, a high correlation (R2 = 0.95) was found between ODmax data obtained in the AS assays and that of the 2-L bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. However, AS was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. The relationship was still good for ODmax between AS data and that of the bioreactor data with L. rhamnosus R-011 in industrial LBS medium (R2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the S. thermophilus R-083 on Rosell #43 industrial medium (R2 = 0.33). Since PE cost 40% less than YE, there are strong economic advantages in considering such a partial replacement of YE by PE.
TI  - [A study on anti-caries activity of genetic recombinant vaccine of Streptococcus  lactis. II. Immunization in vein with recombinant S. lactis in pregnant rabbits].
AB  - The effects of immunization in vein with recombinant S. lactis HL107 carring the  S. mutans surface protein PAc gene in pregnant rabbits were studied. The results indicated that specific anti-PAc IgG in serum and milk were obviously induced 1 week after immunization and retained at high level for several weeks. It suggests that the recombinant S. lactis HL107 possessing immunogenicity of S. mutans surface protein PAc is able to stimulate specific systemic immune response against PAc.
TI  - Direct observation of bacterial exopolysaccharides in dairy products using confocal scanning laser microscopy.
AB  - The objective of this work was to develop a methodology for direct visualization  of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) in fully hydrated dairy products. The new method involved staining EPS with wheat germ agglutinin labeled with Alexa fluor 488 or staining with concanavalin A 488. Samples were observed using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Distribution of EPS produced by Lactococcus lactis (CHCC 3367), a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus (CHCC 3534) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (CHCC 769) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus RR in milk was compared in stirred and unstirred fermented milk. The EPS and proteins were observed as distinct entities, with EPS present in the protein network pores. EPS was observed in greater amounts in milk fermented by the ropy L. lactis culture than in milk fermented by the less ropy strain of S. thermophilus. Stirring the fermented milk caused aggregation of EPS into more extended structures. The more ropy the culture, the longer and larger the strands formed during stirring. The method was also applied to Feta cheese made with an EPS-producing strain of S. thermophilus. EPS was observed in the cheese as thick sheets filling pores in the protein network.
TI  - Functional study of Lactococcus lactis RNase III in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Endoribonuclease III (RNase III) is known to participate in a number of RNA maturation and decay pathways. Previous research carried out on citQRP mRNA processing had provided strong evidence that RNase III exists in Lactococcus lactis and acts as a major endoribonuclease in the control of citQRP mRNA stability. The DNA coding (rnc) for the putative lactococcal RNase III was cloned by PCR technology. In addition, we provide the transcriptional analysis of rnc gene and compared the lactococcal RNase III sequence to those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. This computer-assisted comparison showed an identity ranking from 37% to 54%, and the highest score was obtained with Streptococcus pneumoniae RNase III. Moreover, heterologous complementation indicated that lactococcal RNase III is able to complement the loss of Escherichia coli RNase III for both 30S RNA processing and lambda N posttranscriptional regulator.
TI  - The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in PmpA, the PrsA-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The prsA-like gene from Lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to PrsA, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in Bacillus subtilis, was characterized. This gene, annotated pmpA, encodes a lipoprotein of 309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. A slight increase in the expression of the PrsA-like protein (PLP) in L. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the Staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. This shows that PmpA either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease HtrA. Unlike the case for B. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding PmpA reduced only slightly the growth rate of L. lactis in standard conditions. However, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. Like PrsA of B. subtilis and PrtM of L. lactis, the L. lactis PmpA protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. These proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (PPIases) for which parvulin is the prototype. Almost all PLP from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the PPIase signature. An exception to this situation was found only in Streptococcaceae, the family to which L. lactis belongs. PLP from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of L. lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus mutans do not. However, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of PLP is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. The activity associated with the expression of PmpA in L. lactis and these genomic data show that either the PPIase motif is not necessary for PPIase activity or, more likely, PmpA foldase activity does not necessarily require PPIase activity.
TI  - Selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. We examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two Streptococcus thermophilus and two Lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ176. Two of them, Strep. thermophilus NCC1561 and Lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis NCC2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. Furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. In this system, Lactoc. lactis NCC2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of Streptococcus oralis OMZ607, Veillonella dispar OMZ493, Actinomyces naeslundii OMZ745 and of the cariogenic Strep. sobrinus OMZ176. These findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.
TI  - Complete genomic sequence of bacteriophage ul36: demonstration of phage heterogeneity within the P335 quasi-species of lactococcal phages.
AB  - The complete genomic sequence of the Lactococcus lactis virulent phage ul36 belonging to P335 lactococcal phage species was determined and analyzed. The genomic sequence of this lactococcal phage contained 36,798 bp with an overall G+C content of 35.8 mol %. Fifty-nine open reading frames (ORFs) of more than 40 codons were found. N-terminal sequencing of phage structural proteins as well as bioinformatic analysis led to the attribution of a function to 24 ORFs (41%). A lysogeny module was found within the genome of this virulent phage. The putative integrase gene seems to be the product of a horizontal transfer because it is more closely related to Streptococcus pyogenes phages than it is to L. lactis phages. Comparative genome analysis with six complete genomes of temperate P335-like phages confirmed the heterogeneity among phages of P335 species. A dUTPase gene is the only conserved gene among all P335 phages analyzed as well as the phage BK5-T. A genetic relationship between P335 phages and the phage-type of the BK5-T species was established. Thus, we proposed that phage BK5-T be included within the P335 species and thereby reducing the number of lactococcal phage species to 11.
TI  - [Comparison of the homologous SfeI and LlaBI restriction-modification systems].
AB  - A fragment containing the SfeI restriction-modification system (RMS) operon was cloned from a Streptococcus faecalis SE72 plasmid. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed its high (99.2%) homology to the operon for Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W56 LlaBI RMS recognizing the same site, 5'-CTRYAG-3'. A substantial difference was that SfeI RMS operon had an additional 198-bp fragment and a larger gene for the putative control protein. No homology was observed between operon-flanking sequences of the two closely related species, suggesting horizontal transfer of the operon.
TI  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. For this aim, a total of 48 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. The detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. A variety of interactions was demonstrated. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit S. thermophilus strains. Among probiotic cultures, Lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium). In general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. The study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). The possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.
TI  - Evaluation of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - N-Acetylchitooligosaccharides ((GlcNAc)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. A chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using HCl. After purification, the purity of each (GlcNAc)(1-6) was >86%. The growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (BM) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium limosum could use (GlcNAc)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (GlcNac)(1-6). GlcNAc was used more readily than (GlcNAc)(2-6) by Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. In BM, Streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.
TI  - Autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from traditional Tunisian dairy products.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the autolytic properties of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from artisan Tunisian dairy products, their peptidoglycan hydrolase content and their activity spectrum. METHODS AND RESULTS: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. The results obtained highlighted a high degree of diversity among the strains analysed, allowing the identification of high and low autolytic Lactococcus lactis strains. Peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing SDS-PAGE using cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity. A major activity band migrating at about 45 kDa was observed. The lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 8% NaCl, 15 mmol l(-1) CaCl2, and in a pH range between 5 and 9.5. The substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolase from Lactococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing SDS-PAGE incorporating cells of different bacterial species. The major autolysin of Lactococcus lactis was active against cells of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Autolytic activity is widely distributed in Lactococcus lactis and the rate of autolysis is strain-dependent. The major peptidoglycan hydrolase showed a wide spectrum of activity against several lactic acid bacteria and bacterial species involved in food-related infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The autolytic phenotype of Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from Tunisian artisan dairy products has been determined, and the data obtained should allow the selection of strains of technological interest in the cheese-ripening process.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  - In an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (A)-->kefir made from kefir grains (B)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (C), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Yeasts (10-17%) identified were Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida inconspicua and Candida maris. In the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. Within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. Along the pathway A-->B-->C, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. K. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir C.
TI  - Diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal Sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA analysis.
AB  - The diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of Ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in Sicily (Italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. The latter included PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes (rDNA). Bacterial and Lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the V6 to V8 and V1 to V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. DGGE profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. Cloning and sequencing of rDNA amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including species of Leuconostoc, Lactococcus lactis, and Macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while Streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. Other thermophilic LAB, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. Comparison of the rRNA-derived patterns obtained by RT-PCR to the rDNA DGGE patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. Identification of cultivated LAB isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16S rDNA analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16S rDNA clone libraries, with the significant exception of the Lactobacillus delbrueckii species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. The present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.
TI  - The potential of a polyphasic PCR-dGGE approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production: bias of culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  - A polyphasic PCR-DGGE approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (NWCs) for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production. Total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing DNA directly extracted from the original samples of NWC. In addition, DNA extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. The 16S rDNA V3 region was amplified using DNA from NWC as well as DNA from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by DGGE. The microbial entities occurring in NWCs were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing of DGGE bands: four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) closest relative of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of DNA directly extracted from NWC while two other LAB, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified by analyzing DNA from the cultivable community. The developed PCR-DGGE analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from NWC and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. Moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
TI  - Production and targeting of the Brucella abortus antigen L7/L12 in Lactococcus lactis: a first step towards food-grade live vaccines against brucellosis.
AB  - Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterial pathogen  that infects humans and animals by entry mainly through the digestive tract. B. abortus causes abortion in pregnant cattle and undulant fever in humans. The immunogenic B. abortus ribosomal protein L7/L12 is a promising candidate antigen for the development of oral live vaccines against brucellosis, using food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a carrier. The L7/L12 gene was expressed in Lactococcus lactis, the model LAB, under the nisin-inducible promoter. Using different signals, L7/L12 was produced in cytoplasmic, cell-wall-anchored, and secreted forms. Cytoplasmic production of L7/L12 gave a low yield, estimated at 0.5 mg/liter. Interestingly, a secretable form of this normally cytoplasmic protein via fusion with a signal peptide resulted in increased yield of L7/L12 to 3 mg/liter; secretion efficiency (SE) was 35%. A fusion between the mature moiety of the staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) and L7/L12 further increased yield to 8 mg/liter. Fusion with a synthetic propeptide (LEISSTCDA) previously described as an enhancer for heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis (Y. Le Loir, A. Gruss, S. D. Ehrlich, and P. Langella, J. Bacteriol. 180:1895-1903, 1998) raised the yield to 8 mg/liter and SE to 50%. A surface-anchored L7/L12 form in L. lactis was obtained by fusing the cell wall anchor of Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein to the C-terminal end of L7/L12. The fusions described allow the production and targeting of L7/L12 in three different locations in L. lactis. This is the first example of a B. abortus antigen produced in a food-grade bacterium and opens new perspectives for alternative vaccine strategies against brucellosis.
TI  - Extracellular arginine aminopeptidase from Streptococcus gordonii FSS2.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. This is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. However, strain FSS2 of S. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a pH-controlled batch culture. In this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (RAP) with some cysteine class characteristics. Isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of approximately 70 kDa, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Nested-PCR cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long DNA fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid N terminus of RAP. Culture activity profiles and N-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. Homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from Streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactococcus lactis. We believe that RAP may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during SBE pathology.
TI  - Sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25.
AB  - The complete 50,237-bp DNA sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25 was determined. The plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23S RNA methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pIP501. Genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in Tn5405 from Staphylococcus aureus and in pJH1 from E. faecalis. One interrupted and five complete IS elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pRE25 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pIP501. It is concluded that pRE25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.
TI  - Surface expression of the conserved C repeat region of streptococcal M6 protein within the Pip bacteriophage receptor of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The C repeat region of the M6 protein (M6c) from Streptococcus pyogenes was expressed within the Pip bacteriophage receptor on the surface of Lactococcus lactis. M6c was also detected in the culture medium. The pip-emm6c allele was integrated into the chromosome and stably expressed without antibiotic selection. The level of cell-associated surface expression of PipM6c was 0.015% of total cellular protein. The amount of PipM6c on the cell surface was increased about 17-fold by expressing pip-emm6c from a high-copy-number plasmid. Replacing the native pip promoter with stronger promoters isolated previously from Lactobacillus acidophilus increased surface expression of PipM6c from the high-copy-number plasmid up to 27-fold. Concomitantly, the amount of PipM6c in the medium increased 113-fold. The amount of PipM6c did not vary greatly between exponential- and stationary-phase cultures. Western blots indicated that the full-length PipM6c protein and most of the numerous proteolytic products were found only on the cell surface, whereas only one proteolytic fragment was found in the culture medium.
TI  - Genetic dissection of the Streptococcus pyogenes M1 protein: regions involved in  fibronectin binding and intracellular invasion.
AB  - Entry of serotype M1 Streptococcus pyogenes into host cells depends on binding of the host glycoprotein fibronectin (Fn) by the bacterial M1 protein. The present study was undertaken to localize the Fn binding region in M1 and assess other potential functions of M1. A set of recombinant M1 protein fragments were assayed for their capacities to bind Fn and inhibit ingestion of streptococci by epithelial cells. M1 protein, M6 protein and internally-deleted derivatives of M1 were expressed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis. Lactococci that expressed M1 or M6 protein bound Fn and were efficiently taken up by epithelial cells. Deletion of both the N-terminal A and B repeats regions of M1 abrogated Fn binding and intracellular invasion. Deletion of either the A domain (M1DeltaA) or B repeats (M1DeltaB) significantly reduced, but did not completely eliminate, Fn binding indicating that M1 protein may possess two independent Fn binding sites. Fn binding by the M1DeltaA or M1DeltaB proteins was insufficient for efficient invasion, however, suggesting that M protein binding alters the structure of Fn that, in turn, affects the interaction between Fn and epithelial cells. Although expression of M1, M6 or M1DeltaB proteins led to aggregation of lactococcal cells, aggregation did not significantly contribute to invasion efficiency.
TI  - Biofilm formation on voice prostheses: in vitro influence of probiotics.
AB  - In order to determine the influence of probiotic bacteria on biofilm formation on Groningen and Provox 2 voice prostheses in an artificial throat, we grew biofilms on both types of voice prostheses and exposed them 3 times daily to a probiotic bacterial suspension. As a control, we perfused an artificial throat with phosphate-buffered saline solution. Perfusion with Lactococcus lactis 53 suspension reduced the percentage numbers of bacteria and yeasts, respectively, on the Groningen prostheses to 17% and 22% and on the Provox 2 prostheses to 19% and 45%, compared to the number of colony-forming units on the control prosthesis, which was set at 100%. A suspension of Streptococcus thermophilus B reduced the percentage numbers of bacteria and yeasts, respectively, on the Groningen prostheses to 53% and 33% and on the Provox 2 prostheses to 14% and 0%, as compared to the control prosthesis. All other probiotic strains tested caused some reduction in the percentages of bacteria or yeasts, but strong differences between the types of prostheses were observed. In conclusion, L. lactis 53 and S. thermophilus B strongly reduce the occurrence of yeasts and bacteria in voice prosthetic biofilms.
TI  - Comparative genomics reveals close genetic relationships between phages from dairy bacteria and pathogenic Streptococci: evolutionary implications for prophage-host interactions.
AB  - The genome of the highly pathogenic M1 serotype Streptococcus pyogenes isolate SF370 contains eight prophage elements. Only prophage SF370.1 could be induced by mitomycin C treatment. Prophage SF370.3 showed a 33.5-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of the cos-site temperate Siphovirus r1t infecting the dairy bacterium Lactococcus lactis. The two-phage genomes shared between 60 and 70% nucleotide sequence identity over the DNA packaging, head and tail genes. Analysis of the SF370.3 genome revealed mutations in the replisome organizer gene that may prevent the induction of the prophage. The mutated phage replication gene was closely related to a virulence marker identified in recently emerged M3 serotype S. pyogenes strains in Japan. This observation suggests that prophage genes confer selective advantage to the lysogenic host. SF370.3 encodes a hyaluronidase and a DNase that may facilitate the spreading of S. pyogenes through tissue planes of its human host. Prophage SF370.2 showed a 43-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of pac-site temperate Siphoviridae infecting the dairy bacteria S. thermophilus and L. lactis. Over part of the structural genes, the similarity between SF370.2 and S. thermophilus phage O1205 extended to the nucleotide sequence level. SF370.2 showed two probable inactivating mutations: one in the replisome organizer gene and another in the gene encoding the portal protein. Prophage SF370.2 also encodes a hyaluronidase and in addition two very likely virulence factors: prophage-encoded toxins acting as superantigens that may contribute to the immune deregulation observed during invasive streptococcal infections. The superantigens are encoded between the phage lysin and the right attachment site of the prophage genome. The genes were nearly sequence identical with a DNA segment in S. equi, suggesting horizontal gene transfer. The trend for prophage genome inactivation was even more evident for the remaining five prophage sequences that showed massive losses of prophage DNA. In these prophage remnants only 13-0.3 kb of putative prophage DNA was detected. We discuss the genomics data from S. pyogenes strain SF370 within the framework of Darwinian coevolution of prophages and lysogenic bacteria and suggest elements of genetic cooperation and elements of an arms race in this host-parasite relationship.
TI  - Heterologous expression and characterization of the exopolysaccharide from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi39.
AB  - The genes responsible for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis in Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi39 were identified on a 20-kb genomic fragment. The two genes, epsE and epsG, were shown to be involved in EPS synthesis as their disruption lead to the loss of the ropy phenotype. Several naturally selected nonropy mutants were isolated, one acquired an insertion sequence (IS)-element (IS905) in the middle of the eps gene cluster. The eps gene cluster was cloned and transferred into a nonEPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363. The EPS produced was shown by chemical analysis and NMR spectroscopy to be identical to the EPS produced by S. thermophilus Sfi39. This demonstrated first that all genes needed for EPS production and export were present in the S. thermophilus Sfi39 eps gene cluster, and second that the heterologous production of an EPS was possible by transfer of the complete eps gene cluster alone, provided that the heterologous host possessed all necessary genetic information for precursor synthesis.
TI  - Utilization of tmRNA sequences for bacterial identification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ribosomal RNA molecules are widely used for phylogenetic and in situ  identification of bacteria. Nevertheless, their use to distinguish microorganisms within a species is often restricted by the high degree of sequence conservation and limited probe accessibility to the target in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To overcome these limitations, we examined the use of tmRNA for in situ identification. In E. coli, this stable 363 nucleotides long RNA is encoded by the ssrA gene, which is involved in the degradation of truncated proteins. RESULTS: Conserved sequences at the 5'- and 3'-ends of tmRNA genes were used to design universal primers that could amplify the internal part of ssrA from Gram-positive bacteria having low G+C content, i.e. genera Bacillus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Sequence analysis of tmRNAs showed that this molecule can be used for phylogenetic assignment of bacteria. Compared to 16S rRNA, the tmRNA nucleotide sequences of some bacteria, for example Listeria, display considerable divergence between species. Using E. coli as an example, we have shown that bacteria can be specifically visualized by FISH with tmRNA targeted probes. CONCLUSIONS: Features of tmRNA, including its presence in phylogenetically distant bacteria, conserved regions at gene extremities and a potential to serve as target for FISH, make this molecule a possible candidate for identification of bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of Streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  - Fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. DNA for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction, cloned into a surface display vector pSAK332, and introduced into L. casei. The fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of Staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of Lactococcus lactis NCDO 763. The fibronectin binding ability of the resulting L. casei was confirmed with Western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. These results indicate that L. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. This L. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.
TI  - Studies on the genomic organization of recombinant Streptococcus gordonii and the development of a novel intergenic integration site for foreign gene expression.
AB  - The methods currently employed to produce recombinant Streptococcus gordonii strains for use as vaccines and/or protein expression vectors result in the insertion of foreign genes into an unknown integration site with no information on the transcriptional context or potential phenotypic consequences. Therefore, the genomic organization surrounding the insertion site of a recombinant strain of S. gordonii (GP1223) containing a portion of the emm6 gene of Streptococcus pyogenes was determined. The nucleotide sequence of chromosomal walks in both directions from the insertion site revealed that the insert was flanked by a duplicated 3061-bp ClaI fragment. A consensus gram-positive promoter and a factor-independent RNA polymerase terminator sequence could be deduced in the fragment immediately upstream of the insertion site. The ClaI fragment also encoded open reading frames (ORFs) with high homology and parallel structural organization to the leucine biosynthesis operon of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Chromosomal walks downstream of the identified promoter region on the non-recombinant parental strain, GP204, yielded the sequence of two ORFs which would be normal targets of the transcription derived from this promoter. Northern analyses detected a highly expressed M6-specific transcript in recombinant strain GP1223 consistent in size with the proposed transcription unit. Transcripts analogous in length to those observed for the leucine biosynthesis operon of L. lactis subsp. lactis were also detected encompassing the homologous ORFs of S. gordonii. This information has enabled the construction of a recombinant S. gordonii strain in which the emm6 gene from S. pyogenes was targeted to a distinct intergenic locus within the S. gordonii genome. This new recombination site allows for expression of foreign gene products with minimal perturbation of the genomic organization of the wild-type S. gordonii strain and has provided information essential for further optimization of foreign gene expression levels.
TI  - Determination of Enterococcus faecalis groESL full-length sequence and application for species identification.
AB  - Amplification of the partial Cpn60 (or GroEL) gene segment has been used for identification of many bacteria, including Enterococcus species. To obtain more sequence data from groESL genes of Enterococcus faecalis, the full-length sequence of the E. faecalis groESL genes containing groES (285 bp), spacer (57 bp), and groEL (1,626 bp) was determined. A database search of GenBank revealed that the deduced E. faecalis GroES and GroEL proteins show significant homology to the GroES and GroEL proteins of other bacteria. The GroEL (groEL) of E. faecalis had the highest identity with Streptococcus pneumoniae (81.8% amino acid sequence identity and 73.0% nucleotide sequence identity), followed by Lactococcus zeae, while GroES (groES) had 60.2% (64.6%) identity with Lactobacillus zeae and 58.5% (66.2%) identity with Lactococcus lactis, followed by 57.0% (65.5%) identity with Bacillus subtilis. Based on the groES sequence, an E. faecalis-specific PCR assay was developed, and this PCR assay was positive for all the E. faecalis strains tested. Dot blot hybridization using either groES or groEL as the probe distinguished E. faecalis clearly from other species, indicating that both genes can be used as suitable targets for E. faecalis identification. Moreover, broad-range PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of groESL was designed to differentiate eight commonly encountered Enterococcus species. The Enterococcus species of reference strains could be easily differentiated on the basis of restriction patterns produced by HaeIII and RsaI. The DNA-based assays developed in this study provide an alternative to currently used methods of identification for clinically important enterococcal species.
TI  - [Viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (Streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en Venezuela].
AB  - National and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. In Venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. This research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. For this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. The different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. These samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of pH and acidity. The absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. The succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. The data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.
TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus in cheddar cheese--production and fate of galactose.
AB  - The behaviour of Streptococcus thermophilus in combination with Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental Cheddar cheese is reported. In a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38 degrees C cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of Str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. At a 41 degrees C cook temperature, the Str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). Lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using Str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of cheese ripening. Adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. Some possible consequences for cheese quality of using Str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.
TI  - [Study on the vaccine against dental caries of recombinant Streptococcus lactis and artificial active immunization. V. Extraction, purification and dot blot analysis of RNA in the recombinant S. lactis].
AB  - To investigate the transcription level of the pac gene in the recombinant S. lactis, the amount of PAc-specific mRNA was measured by RNA dot blot analysis with the biotin-labeled 1.5 kb PstI fragment of the pac gene. RNA were extracted with guanidinium thiocyanate followed by centrifugation in cesium chloride solutions. These results indicated the sequence of PAc-mRNA in S. lactis HL107 or HL45 was the same as that in S. mutans Ingbritt and showed similar density photograph. The PAc-specific mRNA plated an intermediary role of protein synthesis in recombinant S. lactis and made it complete the expression of cloned pac gene.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria as live vaccines.
AB  - Mucosal routes for vaccine delivery offer several advantages over systemic inoculation from both immunological and practical points of view. The development of efficient mucosal vaccines therefore represents a top prority in modern vaccinology. One way to deliver protective antigens at the mucosal surfaces is to use live bacterial vectors. Until recently most of these were derived from attenuated pathogenic microorganisms. As an alternative to this strategy, non-pathogenic food grade bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are being tested for their efficacy as live antigen carriers. The LABVAC european research network is presently comparing the vaccine potential of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus gordonii and Lactobacillus spp. To date, it has been shown that systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immune responses can be elicited in mice through the nasal route using the three LAB systems under study. Data on successful oral and vaginal immunisations are also accumulating for L. lactis and S. gordonii, respectively. Moreover, the immune responses can be potentiated by co-expression of interleukins. Future areas of research include improvement of local immunisation efficiency, analysis of in vivo antigen production, unravelling of the Lactobacillus colonisation mechanisms and construction of biologically contained strains.
TI  - Of staphs, streps and other things.
AB  
TI  - Design of a protein-targeting system for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - We designed an expression and export system that enabled the targeting of a reporter protein (the staphylococcal nuclease Nuc) to specific locations in Lactococcus lactis cells, i.e., cytoplasm, cell wall, or medium. Optimization of protein secretion and of protein cell wall anchoring was performed with L. lactis cells by modifying the signals located at the N and C termini, respectively, of the reporter protein. Efficient translocation of precursor (approximately 95%) is obtained using the signal peptide from the lactococcal Usp45 protein and provided that the mature protein is fused to overall anionic amino acids at its N terminus; those residues prevented interactions of Nuc with the cell envelope. Nuc could be covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan by using the cell wall anchor motif of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein. However, the anchoring step proved to not be totally efficient in L. lactis, as considerable amounts of protein remained membrane associated. Our results may suggest that the defect is due to limiting sortase in the cell. The optimized expression and export vectors also allowed secretion and cell wall anchoring of Nuc in food-fermenting and commensal strains of Lactobacillus. In all strains tested, both secreted and cell wall-anchored Nuc was enzymatically active, suggesting proper enzyme folding in the different locations. These results provide the first report of a targeting system in lactic acid bacteria in which the final location of a protein is controlled and biological activity is maintained.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - The complete genome sequence of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis IL1403.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is a nonpathogenic AT-rich gram-positive bacterium closely related to the genus Streptococcus and is the most commonly used cheese starter. It is also the best-characterized lactic acid bacterium. We sequenced the genome of the laboratory strain IL1403, using a novel two-step strategy that comprises diagnostic sequencing of the entire genome and a shotgun polishing step. The genome contains 2,365,589 base pairs and encodes 2310 proteins, including 293 protein-coding genes belonging to six prophages and 43 insertion sequence (IS) elements. Nonrandom distribution of IS elements indicates that the chromosome of the sequenced strain may be a product of recent recombination between two closely related genomes. A complete set of late competence genes is present, indicating the ability of L. lactis to undergo DNA transformation. Genomic sequence revealed new possibilities for fermentation pathways and for aerobic respiration. It also indicated a horizontal transfer of genetic information from Lactococcus to gram-negative enteric bacteria of Salmonella-Escherichia group.
TI  - Comparative genomics of lactococcal phages: insight from the complete genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis phage BK5-T.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis phage BK5-T and Streptococcus thermophilus phage Sfi21, two cos-site temperate Siphoviridae with 40-kb genomes, share an identical genome organization, sequence similarity at the amino acid level over about half of their genomes, and nucleotide sequence identity of 60% over the DNA packaging and head morphogenesis modules. Siphoviridae with similarly organized genomes and substantial protein sequence similarity were identified in several genera of low-GC-content Gram-positive bacteria. These phages demonstrated a gradient of relatedness ranging from nucleotide sequence similarity to protein sequence similarity to gene map similarity over the DNA packaging and head morphogenesis modules. Interestingly, the degree of relatedness was correlated with the evolutionary distance separating their bacterial hosts. These observations suggest elements of vertical evolution in phages. The structural genes from BK5-T shared no sequence relationships with corresponding genes/proteins from lactococcal phages belonging to distinct lactococcal phage species, including phage sk1 (phage species 936) that showed a closely related gene map. Despite a clearly distinct genome organization, lactococcal phages sk1 and c2 showed nine sequence-related proteins. Over the early gene cluster phage BK5-T shared nine regions of high nucleotide sequence similarity, covering at most two adjacent genes, with lactococcal phage r1t (phage species P335). Over the structural genes, the closest relatives of phage r1t were not lactococcal phages belonging to other phage species, but Siphoviridae from Mycobacteria (high-GC-content Gram-positive bacteria). Evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer between distinct phage species was obtained for dairy phages, but these transfers were limited to phages infecting the same bacterial host species.
TI  - Dynamics of the microbial community responsible for traditional sour cassava starch fermentation studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative rRNA hybridization.
AB  - The microbial community developing during the spontaneous fermentation of sour cassava starch was investigated by cultivation-independent methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partially amplified 16S rDNA followed by sequencing of the most intense bands showed that the dominant organisms were all lactic acid bacteria (LAB), mainly close relatives of Bifidobacterium minimum, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus sp., Enterococcus saccharolyticus and Lactobacillus plantarum., Close relatives of Lb. panis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Ln. citreum were also found. A complementary analysis using hybridization of 16S rRNA with phylogenetic probes was necessary to detect the presence of the recently discovered species Lb. manihotivorans. Although it represented up to 13% of the total lactic acid bacteria of sour cassava starch, this species could not be detected by DGGE as the PCR product migrated to the same position as Lc. lactis. In addition, it was shown that a strong pH decrease in the time course of fermentation was most probably responsible for the competitive selection of acid-resistant LAB vs. both homo and heterofermentative acid-sensitive LAB.
TI  - Flow cytometric assessment of viability of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The viability of lactic acid bacteria is crucial for their applications as dairy  starters and as probiotics. We investigated the usefulness of flow cytometry (FCM) for viability assessment of lactic acid bacteria. The esterase substrate carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) and the dye exclusion DNA binding probes propidium iodide (PI) and TOTO-1 were tested for live/dead discrimination using a Lactococcus, a Streptococcus, three Lactobacillus, two Leuconostoc, an Enterococcus, and a Pediococcus species. Plate count experiments were performed to validate the results of the FCM assays. The results showed that cFDA was an accurate stain for live cells; in exponential-phase cultures almost all cells were labeled, while 70 degrees C heat-killed cultures were left unstained. PI did not give clear live/dead discrimination for some of the species. TOTO-1, on the other hand, gave clear discrimination between live and dead cells. The combination of cFDA and TOTO-1 gave the best results. Well-separated subpopulations of live and dead cells could be detected with FCM. Cell sorting of the subpopulations and subsequent plating on agar medium provided direct evidence that cFDA labels the culturable subpopulation and that TOTO-1 labels the nonculturable subpopulation. Applied to cultures exposed to deconjugated bile salts or to acid, cFDA and TOTO-1 proved to be accurate indicators of culturability. Our experiments with lactic acid bacteria demonstrated that the combination of cFDA and TOTO-1 makes an excellent live/dead assay with versatile applications.
TI  - Lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a Mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total DNA extraction and purification procedure and PCR amplification of 16S rDNA for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. Thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. These partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database of NCBI. The identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. This analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus suis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lact. casei, Lact. alimentarium, and Lact. delbruekii and Clostridium sp. Two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. Unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. Use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques
TI  - Live bacterial delivery systems for development of mucosal vaccines.
AB  - By expression of foreign antigens in attenuated strains derived from bacterial pathogens and in non-pathogenic commensal bacteria, recombinant vaccines are being developed that aim to stimulate mucosal immunity. Recent advances in the pathogenesis and molecular biology of these bacteria have allowed rational development of new and improved bacterial carriers and more effective gene expression systems. These advances have improved the performance and versatility of these delivery systems to induce mucosal immunity to recombinant antigens in animal models. Application of these (improved) technologies for development of human vaccines is still limited and awaits further exploration.
TI  - The microbiology of South African traditional fermented milks.
AB  - A total of 15 samples of traditional fermented milk were collected from individual households in South Africa and Namibia. Lactic acid bacteria dominated the microflora of these samples, especially the genera Leuconostoc, Lactococcus and Lactobacillus. Other groups identified included pyogenic streptococci and enterococci. The dominant lactococci species was Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Eighty-three percent of the leuconostoc isolates were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum. Other species identified included Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus plantarum.
TI  - Analysis of the genetic switch and replication region of a P335-type bacteriophage with an obligate lytic lifestyle on Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The DNA sequence of the replication module, part of the lysis module, and remnants of a lysogenic module from the lytic P335 species lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was determined, and its regulatory elements were investigated. The identification of a characteristic genetic switch including two divergent promoters and two cognate repressor genes strongly indicates that phi31 was derived from a temperate bacteriophage. Regulation of the two early promoters was analyzed by primer extension and transcriptional promoter fusions to a lacLM reporter. The regulatory behavior of the promoter region differed significantly from the genetic responses of temperate Lactococcus lactis phages. The cro gene homologue regulates its own production and is an efficient repressor of cI gene expression. No detectable cI gene expression could be measured in the presence of cro. cI gene expression in the absence of cro exerted minor influences on the regulation of the two promoters within the genetic switch. Homology comparisons revealed a replication module which is most likely expressed from the promoter located upstream of the cro gene homologue. The replication module encoded genes with strong homology to helicases and primases found in several Streptococcus thermophilus phages. Downstream of the primase homologue, an AT-rich noncoding origin region was identified. The characteristics and location of this region and its ability to reduce the efficiency of plaquing of phi31 10(6)-fold when present at high copy number in trans provide evidence for identification of the phage origin of replication. Phage phi31 is an obligately lytic phage that was isolated from commercial dairy fermentation environments. Neither a phage attachment site nor an integrase gene, required to establish lysogeny, was identified, explaining its lytic lifestyle and suggesting its origin from a temperate phage ancestor. Several regions showing extensive DNA and protein homologies to different temperate phages of Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus were also discovered, indicating the likely exchange of DNA cassettes through horizontal gene transfer in the dynamic ecological environment of dairy fermentations.
TI  - Characterization by molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding an aminopeptidase from Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - The pepC gene of Listeria monocytogenes encodes aminopeptidase C that is predicted to share 72% amino acid sequence similarity and 53% sequence identity with the cysteine aminopeptidase PepC from Lactococcus lactis. The gene product also shows strong similarity to aminopeptidase C from Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus, and to a cysteine proteinase/bleomycin hydrolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme from L. monocytogenes displayed broad N-terminal hydrolytic activity, with a similar substrate specificity to its lactic acid bacterial counterpart. The inhibition spectrum shows a great deal of similarity with enzymes from the family of lactic acid bacteria. In addition, one of the clones studied contained DNA sequences that could encode a regulatory protein of the deoR helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein family. The organization of the locus, designated pep, is presented along with the characterization of the gene products of the pep locus.
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Genetic loci of Streptococcus mitis that mediate binding to human platelets.
AB  - The direct binding of bacteria to platelets is a postulated major interaction in  the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. To identify bacterial components that mediate platelet binding by Streptococcus mitis, we screened a Tn916deltaE-derived mutant library of S. mitis strain SF100 for reduced binding to human platelets in vitro. Two distinct loci were found to affect platelet binding. The first contains a gene (pblT) encoding a highly hydrophobic, 43-kDa protein with 12 potential membrane-spanning segments. This protein resembles members of the major facilitator superfamily of small-molecule transporters. The second platelet binding locus consists of an apparent polycistronic operon. This region includes genes that are highly similar to those of Lactococcus lactis phage r1t and Streptococcus thermophilus phage 01205. Two genes (pblA and pblB) encoding large surface proteins are also present. The former encodes a 107-kDa protein containing tryptophan-rich repeats, which may serve to anchor the protein within the cell wall. The latter encodes a 121-kDa protein most similar to a tail fiber protein from phage 01205. Functional mapping by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and gene complementation indicates that PblB may be a platelet adhesin and that expression of PblB may be linked to that of PblA. The combined data indicate that at least two genomic regions contribute to platelet binding by S. mitis. One encodes a probable transmembrane transporter, while the second encodes two large surface proteins resembling structural components of lysogenic phages.
TI  - Analysis of six prophages in Lactococcus lactis IL1403: different genetic structure of temperate and virulent phage populations.
AB  - We report the genetic organisation of six prophages present in the genome of Lactococcus lactis IL1403. The three larger prophages (36-42 kb), belong to the already described P335 group of temperate phages, whereas the three smaller ones (13-15 kb) are most probably satellites relying on helper phage(s) for multiplication. These data give a new insight into the genetic structure of lactococcal phage populations. P335 temperate phages have variable genomes, sharing homology over only 10-33% of their length. In contrast, virulent phages have highly similar genomes sharing homology over >90% of their length. Further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, MYCOBACTERIUM: and Streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. This might reflect different intensities of horizontal DNA exchange: low among purely virulent phages and high among temperate phages and their lytic homologues. We suggest that the constraints on genetic exchange among purely virulent phages reflect their optimal genetic organisation, adapted to a more specialised and extreme form of parasitism than temperate/lytic phages.
TI  - Cloning of genomic DNA of Lactococcus lactis that restores phage sensitivity to an unusual bacteriophage sk1-resistant mutant.
AB  - An unusual, spontaneous, phage sk1-resistant mutant (RMSK1/1) of Lactococcus lactis C2 apparently blocks phage DNA entry into the host. Although no visible plaques formed on RMSK1/1, this host propagated phage at a reduced efficiency. This was evident from center-of-infection experiments, which showed that 21% of infected RMSK1/1 formed plaques when plated on its phage-sensitive parental strain, C2. Moreover, viable cell counts 0 and 4 h after infection were not significantly different from those of an uninfected culture. Further characterization showed that phage adsorption was normal, but burst size was reduced fivefold and the latent period was increased from 28.5 to 36 min. RMSK1/1 was resistant to other, but not all, similar phages. Phage sensitivity was restored to RMSK1/1 by transformation with a cloned DNA fragment from a genomic library of a phage-sensitive strain. Characterization of the DNA that restored phage sensitivity revealed an open reading frame with similarity to sequences encoding lysozymes (beta-1,4-N-acetylmuramidase) and lysins from various bacteria, a fungus, and phages of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus and also revealed DNA homologous to noncoding sequences of temperate phage of L. lactis, DNA similar to a region of phage sk1, a gene with similarity to tRNA genes, a prophage attachment site, and open reading frames with similarities to sun and to sequences encoding phosphoprotein phosphatases and protein kinases. Mutational analyses of the cloned DNA showed that the region of homology with lactococcal temperate phage was responsible for restoring the phage-sensitive phenotype. The region of homology with DNA of lactococcal temperate phage was similar to DNA from a previously characterized lactococcal phage that suppresses an abortive infection mechanism of phage resistance. The region of homology with lactococcal temperate phage was deleted from a phage-sensitive strain, but the strain was not phage resistant. The results suggest that the cloned DNA with homology to lactococcal temperate phage was not mutated in the phage-resistant strain. The cloned DNA apparently suppressed the mechanism of resistance, and it may do so by mimicking a region of phage DNA that interacts with components of the resistance mechanism.
TI  - Characterization of the cryptic plasmid pSBO2 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid designated pSBO2 (3582 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. The pSBO2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (Cop), countertranscribed RNAs (ctRNAs), and a replication protein (Rep), which were similar to those from pMV158 and pLS1, which were isolated from S. agalactiae, and pWVO1, isolated from Lactococcus lactis. The putative single-strand origin (sso) of pSBO2 was similar to pER341 and pST1, which were isolated from S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmid designated pSBE2 was constructed to bind pECM184 vector and the DNA fragment containing sso, dso, Cop, ctRNAs, and Rep of pSBO2. When pSBE2 was introduced into S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. This plasmid, designated pSBE2A, was capable of transforming Escherichia coli and S. bovis strains 12-U-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, pSBE2A is an effective shuttle vector.
TI  - Molecular properties of Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid pER35 encoding a restriction modification system.
AB  - Bacteriophage attack on lactic fermentation bacteria (LFB) is costly to the dairy industry because it results in product loss. One mechanism used by LFB to protect themselves from bacteriophage attack is restriction of foreign DNA. Three plasmids, pER16, pER35, and pER36, from three different strains of the thermotolerant dairy fermentation bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus were sequenced. One of these plasmids, pER35, isolated from S. thermophilus ST135, encoded a type IC restriction-modification (R-M) system very similar to those encoded on plasmids pIL2614 in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pND861 in Lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis. The high degree of identity between the R-M systems encoded on pER35, pIL2614, and pND861 indicated the potential for horizontal transfer of these genes between different species of lactic fermentation bacteria. Similar to the functional R-M system encoded on pIL2614 that protects the mesophilic L. lactis subsp. lactis against phage attack, the R-M system on pER35 most likely functions in the same role in S. thermophilus ST135. The plasmid pER16 was found to encode the specificity subunit of the R-M system, but not the R or M subunits. In addition, all three plasmids encoded proteins that are present on other S. thermophilus plasmids, including a protein for rolling-circle replication (RepA) and a low-molecular-weight stress protein (Hsp). The presence of a complete R-M system encoded on a plasmid in S. thermophilus, a species that often lacks plasmids, is novel and may be beneficial for protecting S. thermophilus from bacteriophage attack under dairy fermentation conditions.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal transfer of SsuDAT1I restriction-modification genes to the Streptococcus suis genome.
AB  - Different strains of Streptococcus suis serotypes 1 and 2 isolated from pigs either contained a restriction-modification (R-M) system or lacked it. The R-M system was an isoschizomer of Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII, which recognizes nucleotide sequence 5'-GATC-3'. The nucleotide sequencing of the genes encoding the R-M system in S. suis DAT1, designated SsuDAT1I, showed that the SsuDAT1I gene region contained two methyltransferase genes, designated ssuMA and ssuMB, as does the DpnII system. The deduced amino acid sequences of M. SsuMA and M.SsuMB showed 70 and 90% identity to M.DpnII and M.DpnA, respectively. However, the SsuDAT1I system contained two isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease genes, designated ssuRA and ssuRB. The deduced amino acid sequence of R.SsuRA was 49% identical to that of R.DpnII, and R.SsuRB was 72% identical to R.LlaDCHI of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris DCH-4. The four SsuDAT1I genes overlapped and were bounded by purine biosynthetic gene clusters in the following gene order: purF-purM-purN-purH-ssuMA-ssuMB-ssuRA++ +-ssuRB-purD-purE. The G+C content of the SsuDAT1I gene region (34.1%) was lower than that of the pur region (48.9%), suggesting horizontal transfer of the SsuDAT1I system. No transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the flanking regions. The SsuDAT1I genes were functional by themselves, as they were individually expressed in Escherichia coli. Comparison of the sequences between strains with and without the R-M system showed that only the region from 53 bp upstream of ssuMA to 5 bp downstream of ssuRB was inserted in the intergenic sequence between purH and purD and that the insertion target site was not the recognition site of SsuDAT1I. No notable substitutions or insertions could be found, and the structures were conserved among all the strains. These results suggest that the SsuDAT1I system could have been integrated into the S. suis chromosome by an illegitimate recombination mechanism.
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Bacteria have always been considered ideal organisms for genetic analysis. While  this is true for some model organisms, like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and, more recently, Lactococcus lactis, genetic analysis of other organisms is often prevented by lack of valuable tools, like vectors, transposons and methods for transformation, gene inactivation and random insertional mutagenesis. This is the case of the moderately thermophilic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, an organism that, in spite of its widespread use for food fermentations, is only poorly characterized. We report here an insertional mutagenesis system that allows efficient random mutagenesis, easy characterization of the interrupted genes and construction of stable null mutations. This may become a powerful S. thermophilus tool for both genetic analysis and construction of 'food-grade' mutants of this biotechnologically relevant microorganism.
TI  - Branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis is essential for optimal growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are nutritionally demanding bacteria which need, among other things, amino acids for optimal growth. We identified the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway as an essential pathway for optimal growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk. Through random insertional mutagenesis, we isolated and characterized two mutants for which growth in milk is affected as a consequence of ilvB and ilvC gene interruptions. This situation demonstrates that the BCAA biosynthesis pathway is active in S. thermophilus. BCAA biosynthesis is necessary but not sufficient for optimal growth of S. thermophilus and is subject to retro-inhibition processes. The specificity of the BCAA biosynthesis pathway in S. thermophilus lies in the independent transcription of the ilvC gene encoding a keto acid reductoisomerase acting on acetolactate at the junction of the BCAA and acetoin biosynthesis pathways. The possible advantages for S. thermophilus of keeping this biosynthesis pathway active could be linked either to adaptation of the organism to milk, which is different than that of other dairy bacteria, or to the role of the pathway in maintaining the internal pH.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor Tu in enterococci.
AB  - The elongation factor Tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a GTP binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. One to three tuf genes per genome are present, depending on the bacterial species. Most low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. We have designed degenerate PCR primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned inserts containing putative amplicons. Two different tuf genes (tufA and tufB) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus pseudoavium, and Enterococcus raffinosus. For the other six enterococcal species (Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus columbae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sulfureus, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, and Enterococcus solitarius), only the tufA gene was present. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. The presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufA gene branches with the Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufB gene clusters with the genera Streptococcus and Lactococcus. Primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufB genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and Lactococcus lactis. The data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and Vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Data from four recent studies (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; A. Y. C. Kwok et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) gene, amplified by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (ID). This Cpn60 gene ID method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and Streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. We report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 Enterococcus species (Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus rattus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam, and Enterococcus saccharolyticus), and Vagococcus fluvialis, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus garvieae. From 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the Facklam and Collins phenotyping method (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the Cpn60 ID method. In each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the Cpn60 ID method. The species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam (ATCC 700913), 3; E. asini, 1; E. rattus, 4; E. dispar, 2; E. gallinarum, 20; E. hirae, 9; E. durans, 9; E. faecalis, 12; E. mundtii, 3; E. casseliflavus, 8; E. faecium, 25; E. malodoratus, 3; E. raffinosus, 8; E. avium, 4; E. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown Enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain R871; Vagococcus fluvialis, 4; Lactococcus garvieae, 3; Lactococcus lactis, 3; Leuconostoc sp., 1; and Pediococcus sp., 1. The Cpn60 gene ID method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of Enterococcus and related organisms.
TI  - Biodegradability of food-associated extracellular polysaccharides.
AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on humans. Although the biodegradability of EPSs is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. Therefore, the biodegradability of eight EPSs, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. EPS-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Xanthan, clavan, and the EPSs produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi 39 and SFi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the EPSs produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris B40, Lactobacillus sakei 0-1, S. thermophilus SFi20, and Lactobacillus helveticus Lh59. Clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - Viability of probiotic (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in Argentinian Fresco cheese.
AB  - We evaluated the suitability of Argentinian Fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. We used cultures of Bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), Bifidobacterium longum (two strains), Bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), Lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and Lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. Probiotic, lactic starter (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. Furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (pH 2 and 3) of Fresco cheese. The results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and L. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. Both combinations of bifidobacteria and L. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for L. casei). On the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, L. acidophilus, and L. casei tested adapted well to the Fresco cheese environment. When a cheese homogenate at pH 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. At pH 2, the cell viability was more affected; B. bifidum was the most resistant organism. This study showed that the Argentinian Fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from Lactobacillus phages.
AB  - Three prophage sequences were identified in the Lactobacillus johnsoni strain NCC533. Prophage Lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site Streptococcus thermophilus phages over its DNA packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. Sequence similarity linked the putative DNA packaging and head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. Prophage Lj965/S. thermophilus phage Sfi11/Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1 on one hand and Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H/Lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/Listeria monocytogenes phage A118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 linked both sublines. The putative major head and tail proteins from Lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from Gram-negative bacteria. A clearly independent line of structural genes in Siphoviridae from low-GC Gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site phages including Lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage D3 infecting a Gram-negative bacterium. A phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the ClpP-like protein identified in four cos-site Siphoviridae from Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. The tree suggested that the ClpP-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.
TI  - Regulation of growth inhibition at high temperature, autolysis, transformation and adherence in Streptococcus pneumoniae by clpC.
AB  - The ClpC ATPase is a subfamily of HSP100/Clp molecular chaperones-regulators of proteolysis. By screening a library of loss of function mutants for the ability to survive treatment with penicillin, we identified the gene clpC. The corresponding protein was identified as a ClpC ATPase, sharing strong peptide sequence identity with ClpC of Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactococcus lactis. Northern blot experiments showed that expression of clpC was induced in response to high temperature (40-42 degrees C) versus 37 degrees C, suggesting that ClpC is a heat shock protein. Insertional duplication mutagenesis of clpC resulted in increased tolerance to high temperature; a result in contrast to other bacterial Clp proteases. The clpC-deficient mutant formed long chains and failed to undergo lysis after treatment with penicillin or vancomycin. The effect of the clpC mutation extended to deficiency of adherence to the human type II alveolar cells. Finally, the clpC disruption resulted in decreased genetic transformation. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mutant failed to express pneumolysin and the choline-binding proteins LytA, CbpA, CbpE, CbpF, CbpJ. These results suggest that the heat shock protein ClpC plays an essential complex pleiotropic role in pneumococcal physiology, including cell growth under heat stress, cell division, autolysis, adherence and transformation.
TI  - Characterization of OpuA, a glycine-betaine uptake system of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A Lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli proP proU mutant with a gene library from L. lactis sbsp. cremoris. The cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opuA, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of Bacillus subtilis. Disruption of opuA in L. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. OpuA belongs to the so-called "ABC transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. In B. subtilis OpuA system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. In contrast, in the L. lactis opuA operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. Mapping of L. lactis opuA transcription start identified one mRNA, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. Construction of an opuA-gusA fusion confirmed that opuA transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in L. lactis. When recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of E. coli, the opuA promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in L. lactis.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk during fermentation with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The behavior of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk during fermentation with starter and nonstarter lactic acid bacteria was investigated. Pasteurized milk was co-inoculated with approximately 10(4) CFU/ml of L. monocytogenes and 10(6) CFU/ml of Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, or Streptococcus thermophilus. Inoculated milks were incubated at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 to 72 h. Listeria monocytogenes survived and also grew to some extent during incubation in the presence of all starter cultures; however, inhibition ranged from 83 to 100% based on maximum cell populations. During incubation with L. bulgaricus and L. plantarum, L. monocytogenes was completely inactivated after 20 h and 64 h of incubation at 37 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. The pH of the fermenting milks declined steadily throughout the fermentation periods and was approximately 4.2 at the conclusion of the experimental period regardless both of the starter culture and pathogen combination or the temperature of incubation.
TI  - Identification of saliva-regulated genes of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 by differential display using random arbitrarily primed PCR.
AB  - Attachment of Streptococcus gordonii to the acquired pellicle of the tooth surface involves specific interactions between bacterial adhesins and adsorbed salivary components. To study saliva-regulated gene expression in S. gordonii, we used random arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR). Bacteria were incubated in either brain heart infusion medium or saliva. Total RNA from both conditions was purified and RAP fingerprinted and then PCR amplified with an arbitrary primer. The differentially displayed DNA fragments were cloned, sequenced, and analyzed using the BLAST search network service. Three DNA products were up-regulated. One was identified as that of the sspA and -B genes, which encode the salivary agglutinin glycoprotein-binding proteins SspA and SspB of S. gordonii; another had 79% identity with the Lactococcus lactis clpE gene, encoding a member of the Clp protease family; and the third product showed no significant homology to known genes. Five down-regulated genes were identified which encode proteins involved in bacterial metabolism. We have shown, for the first time, direct induction of sspA and -B in S. gordonii by human saliva.
TI  - Differential protein expression in phenotypic variants of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae undergoes spontaneous phase variation resulting in opaque and transparent colony forms. Differences in colony opacity correlate with differences in virulence: the transparent variants are more capable of colonizing the nasopharynx, whereas the opaque variants show increased virulence during systemic infections. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease at the molecular level, protein expression patterns of the phenotypic variants of two pneumococcal strains were compared by high-resolution two-dimensional protein electrophoresis. In comparison with transparent variants, the opaque variants reduced the expression of two proteins and overexpressed one protein. The proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. The protein overexpressed in the opaque phenotype revealed significant homology to elongation factor Ts of Helicobacter pylori. One of the two proteins that were underexpressed in the opaque variants revealed significant homology to the proteinase maturation protein PrtM of Lactocobacillus paracasei, a member of the family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases. A consensus lipoprotein signal sequence suggests that the putative proteinase maturation protein A, designated PpmA, is located at the surface of the pneumococcus and may play a role in the maturation of surface or secreted proteins. The second underexpressed protein was identified as pyruvate oxidase, SpxB. The lower SpxB expression in opaque variants most probably explains the reduced production of hydrogen peroxide, a reaction product of SpxB, in this variant. Since a spxB-defective pneumococcal mutant has decreased ability to colonize the nasopharynx (B. Spellerberg, D. R. Cundell, J. Sandros, B. J. Pearce, I. Idanpaan-Heikkila, C. Rosenow, and H. R. Masure, 1996. Mol. Microbiol. 19:803-813, 1996), our data suggest that SpxB plays an important role in enhancing the ability of transparent variants to efficiently colonize the nasopharynx.
TI  - Genetic locus for streptolysin S production by group A streptococcus.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS) is an important human pathogen that causes pharyngitis and invasive infections, including necrotizing fasciitis. Streptolysin S (SLS) is the cytolytic factor that creates the zone of beta-hemolysis surrounding GAS colonies grown on blood agar. We recently reported the discovery of a potential genetic determinant involved in SLS production, sagA, encoding a small peptide of 53 amino acids (S. D. Betschel, S. M. Borgia, N. L. Barg, D. E. Low, and J. C. De Azavedo, Infect. Immun. 66:1671-1679, 1998). Using transposon mutagenesis, chromosomal walking steps, and data from the GAS genome sequencing project (www.genome.ou.edu/strep. html), we have now identified a contiguous nine-gene locus (sagA to sagI) involved in SLS production. The sag locus is conserved among GAS strains regardless of M protein type. Targeted plasmid integrational mutagenesis of each gene in the sag operon resulted in an SLS-negative phenotype. Targeted integrations (i) upstream of the sagA promoter and (ii) downstream of a terminator sequence after sagI did not affect SLS production, establishing the functional boundaries of the operon. A rho-independent terminator sequence between sagA and sagB appears to regulate the amount of sagA transcript produced versus transcript for the entire operon. Reintroduction of the nine-gene sag locus on a plasmid vector restored SLS activity to the nonhemolytic sagA knockout mutant. Finally, heterologous expression of the intact sag operon conferred the SLS beta-hemolytic phenotype to the nonhemolytic Lactococcus lactis. We conclude that gene products of the GAS sag operon are both necessary and sufficient for SLS production. Sequence homologies of sag operon gene products suggest that SLS is related to the bacteriocin family of microbial toxins.
TI  - Effect of carbon dioxide under high pressure on the survival of cheese starter cultures.
AB  - A new processing method that rapidly forms curds and whey from milk has the potential to improve cheesemaking procedures if cheese starter cultures can tolerate the processing conditions. The survival of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, or Streptococcus thermophilus through this new process was evaluated. Inoculated milk containing 0, 1, or 3.25% fat or Lactobacillus MRS broth or tryptone yeast lactose broth (depending on microorganism used) was sparged with CO2 to a pressure of 5.52 MPa and held for 5 min at 38 degrees C. Broth contained 7.93 to 8.78 log CFU/ ml before processing and 7.84 to 8.66 log CFU/ml afterward. Before processing, milk inoculated with L bulgaricus, L. lactis, or S. thermophilus contained 6.81, 7.35, or 6.75 log CFU/ml, respectively. After processing, the curds contained 5.68, 7.32, or 6.50 log CFU/g, and the whey had 5.05, 6.43, or 6.14 log CFU/ml, respectively. After processing, the pHs of control samples were lower by 0.41 units in broth, 0.53 units in whey, and 0.89 units in curd. The pH of the processed inoculated samples decreased by 0.3 to 0.53 units in broth, 0.32 to 0.37 units in whey, and 0.93 to 0.98 units in the curd. Storing curds containing L. lactis at 30 degrees C or control curds and curds with L. bulgaricus or S. thermophilus at 37 degrees C for an additional 48 h resulted in pHs of 5.22, 5.41, 4.53, or 4.99, respectively. This study showed that milk inoculated with cheese starter cultures and treated with CO2 under high pressure to precipitate casein-produced curds that contained sufficient numbers of viable starter culture to produce lactic acid, thereby decreasing the pH.
TI  - Dynamic changes of intracellular pH in individual lactic acid bacterium cells in  response to a rapid drop in extracellular pH.
AB  - We describe the dynamics of changes in the intracellular pH (pH(i)) values of a number of lactic acid bacteria in response to a rapid drop in the extracellular pH (pH(ex)). Strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis were investigated. Listeria innocua, a gram-positive, non-lactic acid bacterium, was included for comparison. The method which we used was based on fluorescence ratio imaging of single cells, and it was therefore possible to describe variations in pH(i) within a population. The bacteria were immobilized on a membrane filter, placed in a closed perfusion chamber, and analyzed during a rapid decrease in the pH(ex) from 7.0 to 5.0. Under these conditions, the pH(i) of L. innocua remained neutral (between 7 and 8). In contrast, the pH(i) values of all of the strains of lactic acid bacteria investigated decreased to approximately 5.5 as the pH(ex) was decreased. No pronounced differences were observed between cells of the same strain harvested from the exponential and stationary phases. Small differences between species were observed with regard to the initial pH(i) at pH(ex) 7.0, while different kinetics of pH(i) regulation were observed in different species and also in different strains of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Amplified expression and membrane reconstitution of transport proteins.
AB  
TI  - Mur1, a Streptococcus thermophilus peptidoglycan hydrolase devoid of a specific cell wall binding domain.
AB  - The gene encoding Mur1, a Streptococcus thermophilus peptidoglycan hydrolase, was cloned by homology with acmA, the Lactococcus lactis major autolysin gene. Mur1 is a 24.7-kDa protein endowed with a putative signal peptide. Sequence analysis evidenced that Mur1 encompasses exactly the AcmA region containing the catalytic domain, but lacks the one containing amino acid repeats involved in cell wall binding. Mur1 appears to be expressed and cell-associated in S. thermophilus, as revealed by immunoblot analysis. These results suggest that the cell wall attachment mode of Mur1 differs from that of most peptidoglycan hydrolases described so far.
TI  - Effects of a muramidase on a mixed bacterial community.
AB  - In bacterial communities one bacterium can influence the growth of other members  of the population. These interactions may be based on nutritional factors or may occur via bacterial signaling molecules that are released in the medium. We present an example, showing that in addition to the above means of interactions, muramidases, enzymes that specifically cleave peptidoglycan chains, can also mediate interactions between bacteria. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization we demonstrate that Lactococcus lactis muramidase AcmA can hydrolyze the cell wall of Streptococcus thermophilus, without affecting viability. This intercellular activity of the lactococcal muramidase results in chain disruption of streptococci in vivo. Our data lead us to propose that chains can give growth advantages to streptococci in aerobic conditions.
TI  - Heterologous expression of an immunogenic pneumococcal type 3 capsular polysaccharide in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - In order to develop a new system for the analysis of capsular biosynthetic pathways we have explored the possibility of expressing type 3 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) from the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae in Lactococcus lactis, an unencapsulated lactic acid bacterium being developed as a vaccine delivery vehicle for mucosal immunization. Only three of the four type 3 CPS biosynthesis genes were found to be necessary for the abundant formation (120 mg liter(-1)) of an extracellular type 3 CPS in L. lactis, implying a role for the type 3-specific synthase in the extracellular transport of the CPS or implying the existence of an alternative export system in L. lactis. The authenticity of the expressed heterologous polysaccharide was established by chemical and immunological analyses. Proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of CPSs purified from L. lactis and S. pneumoniae showed that the two CPS structures were identical. When mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 3.5 x 10(6) CFU of live recombinant lactococci expressing a total of approximately 0.5 microgram of type 3 CPS, the immune responses elicited appeared identical to those observed in mice inoculated with 0.5 microgram of type 3 CPS purified from S. pneumoniae. These findings show that L. lactis is a useful host in which to study the role and function of genes involved in the production of bacterial capsules. Additionally, L. lactis shows potential as a host for the safe production of capsule antigens and as a vaccine delivery vehicle for polysaccharide antigens.
TI  - Heterologous inducible expression of Enterococcus faecalis pCF10 aggregation substance asc10 in Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii contributes to cell hydrophobicity and adhesion to fibrin.
AB  - Aggregation substance proteins encoded by the sex pheromone plasmid family of Enterococcus faecalis have been shown previously to contribute to the formation of a stable mating complex between donor and recipient cells and have been implicated in the virulence of this increasingly important nosocomial pathogen. In an effort to characterize the protein further, prgB, the gene encoding the aggregation substance Asc10 on pCF10, was cloned in a vector containing the nisin-inducible nisA promoter and its two-component regulatory system. Expression of aggregation substance after nisin addition to cultures of E. faecalis and the heterologous bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus gordonii was demonstrated. Electron microscopy revealed that Asc10 was presented on the cell surfaces of E. faecalis and L. lactis but not on that of S. gordonii. The protein was also found in the cell culture supernatants of all three species. Characterization of Asc10 on the cell surfaces of E. faecalis and L. lactis revealed a significant increase in cell surface hydrophobicity upon expression of the protein. Heterologous expression of Asc10 on L. lactis also allowed the recognition of its binding ligand (EBS) on the enterococcal cell surface, as indicated by increased transfer of a conjugative transposon. We also found that adhesion of Asc10-expressing bacterial cells to fibrin was elevated, consistent with a role for the protein in the pathogenesis of enterococcal endocarditis. The data demonstrate that Asc10 expressed under the control of the nisA promoter in heterologous species will be an useful tool in the detailed characterization of this important enterococcal conjugation protein and virulence factor.
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - Coinvasion of dentinal tubules by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii depends upon binding specificity of streptococcal antigen I/II adhesin.
AB  - Cell wall-anchored polypeptides of the antigen I/II family are produced by many species of oral streptococci. These proteins mediate adhesion of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins and to other oral microorganisms and promote binding of cells to collagen type I and invasion of dentinal tubules. Since infections of the root canal system have a mixed anaerobic bacterial etiology, we investigated the hypothesis that coadhesion of anaerobic bacteria with streptococci may facilitate invasive endodontic disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 cells were able to invade dentinal tubules when cocultured with Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) but not when cocultured with Streptococcus mutans NG8. An isogenic noninvasive mutant of S. gordonii, with production of SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family) polypeptides abrogated, was deficient in binding to collagen and had a 40% reduced ability to support adhesion of P. gingivalis. Heterologous expression of the S. mutans SpaP (antigen I/II) protein in this mutant restored collagen binding and tubule invasion but not adhesion to P. gingivalis or the ability to promote P. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. An isogenic afimbrial mutant of P. gingivalis had 50% reduced binding to S. gordonii cells but was unaffected in the ability to coinvade dentinal tubules with S. gordonii wild-type cells. Expression of the S. gordonii SspA or SspB polypeptide on the surface of Lactococcus lactis cells endowed these bacteria with the abilities to bind P. gingivalis, penetrate dentinal tubules, and promote P. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. The results demonstrate that collagen-binding and P. gingivalis-binding properties of antigen I/II polypeptides are discrete functions. Specificity of antigen I/II polypeptide recognition accounts for the ability of P. gingivalis to coinvade dentinal tubules with S. gordonii but not with S. mutans. This provides evidence that the specificity of interbacterial coadhesion may influence directly the etiology of pulpal and periapical diseases.
TI  - Engineering a disulfide bond and free thiols in the lantibiotic nisin Z.
AB  - The antimicrobial peptide nisin contains the uncommon amino acid residues lanthionine and methyl-lanthionine, which are post-translationally formed from Ser, Thr and Cys residues. To investigate the importance of these uncommon residues for nisin activity, a mutant was designed in which Thr13 was replaced by a Cys residue, which prevents the formation of the thioether bond of ring C. Instead, Cys13 couples with Cys19 via an intramolecular disulfide bridge, a bond that is very unusual in lantibiotics. NMR analysis of this mutant showed a structure very similar to that of wild-type nisin, except for the configuration of ring C. The modification was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in antimicrobial activity to less than 1% of wild-type activity, indicating that the lanthionine of ring C is very important for this activity. The nisin Z mutants S5C and M17C were also isolated and characterized; they are the first lantibiotics known that contain an additional Cys residue that is not involved in bridge formation but is present as a free thiol. Secretion of these peptides by the lactococcal producer cells, as well as their antimicrobial activity, was found to be strongly dependent on a reducing environment. Their ability to permeabilize lipid vesicles was not thiol-dependent. Labeling of M17C nisin Z with iodoacetamide abolished the thiol-dependence of the peptide. These results show that the presence of a reactive Cys residue in nisin has a strong effect on the antimicrobial properties of the peptide, which is probably the result of interaction of these residues with thiol groups on the outside of bacterial cells.
TI  - The natural food grade inhibitor, lacticin 3147, reduced the incidence of mastitis after experimental challenge with Streptococcus dysgalactiae in nonlactating dairy cows.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by the food-grade organism Lactococcus lactis. Lacticin 3147 is active at a neutral pH and has been shown to be bactericidal to streptococci and staphylococci in vitro. The effectiveness of an intramammary teat seal formulation, and a teat seal containing lacticin 3147 was evaluated at drying off in 68 uninfected quarters of 18 cows. Following infusion of either teat seal or lacticin 3147 combined with teat seal, a deliberate infection challenge of Streptococcus dysgalactiae (approximately equal to 1.5 x 10(4) cfu per teat) was administered by direct inoculation into the teat sinus. During an 8-d experimental period following inoculation, 61% of control quarters and 6% of the treatment quarters either developed clinical mastitis or were shedding the challenge organism. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction genetic typing was used to confirm that both the new infections and the bacteria surviving in the teats at the end of the experiment were the challenge strain. The combination of teat seal and lacticin 3147 was well tolerated within the udder and elicited only a temporary increase in somatic cell count to 5.7 x 10(5)/ml (88 h after infusion) in a previously uninfected lactating udder quarter. Therefore, we concluded that this nonantibiotic approach to mastitis prevention may contribute to a reduction in the routine application of antibiotics at drying off in the future.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria for bile salt hydrolase activity.
AB  - Bile salt hydrolysis is an important metabolic reaction in the bile salt metabolism of mammals. This reaction has a facilitating effect for bile salt excretion but can also be involved in various illnesses. In recent years interest has increased to use bile salt hydrolysis to influence the cholesterol metabolism of humans and farm animals. To understand the distribution and range of bile salt hydrolase activity in lactic acid bacteria, we screened more than 300 strains of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and the species Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Results obtained for 273 strains showed that bile salt hydrolase activity is common in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus but absent in L. lactis, Leu. mesenteroides, and S. thermophilus. Nearly all bifidobacteria species and strains have bile salt hydrolase activity, whereas this activity can only be found in selected species of lactobacilli. A strong correlation can be observed between the habitat of a genus or species and the presence of bile salt hydrolase activity. Most often bile salt hydrolase activity is found in strains that have been isolated from the intestines or from feces from mammals--an environment rich in conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. Strains and species from other habitats like milk or vegetables--environments from which bile salts are absent--do normally not have bile salt hydrolase activity. In two independent assays, we established that bile salt hydrolase activity in bifidobacteria is, in general, much higher than in lactobacilli.
TI  - Chromosomal integration of the green fluorescent protein gene in lactic acid bacteria and the survival of marked strains in human gut simulations.
AB  - An integration vector was constructed to allow introduction of the gfp gene into  the chromosomes of Gram-positive bacteria. Integration depends on homologous recombination between a short 458-nt sequence of the tet(M) gene in the vector and a copy of Tn916 in the host chromosome. Strains of Lactococcus lactis IL1403, Enterococcus faecalis JH2-SS, and Streptococcus gordonii DL1 stably marked with single chromosomal copies of the gfp were readily visualised by epifluorescence microscopy. The marked L. lactis strain survived poorly in a continuous culture system inoculated with human faecal flora, while the laboratory E. faecalis strain was lost at approximately the dilution rate of the fermenter.
TI  - On the microbiological profile of traditional Portuguese sourdough.
AB  - Traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. To this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. More than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via Biomerieux API galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. The dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The most frequently isolated yeasts were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida pelliculosa. The most frequently isolated LAB were (heterofermentative) Leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) Lactobacillus spp.; L. brevis, L. curvatus, and L. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the Lactobacillus genera; Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. durans, and E. faecium for enterococci; and Streptococcus constellantus and S. equinus for streptococci.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - TPW22, a lactococcal temperate phage with a site-specific integrase closely related to Streptococcus thermophilus phage integrases.
AB  - The temperate phage TPW22, induced from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W22, and the evolutionarily interesting integrase of this phage were characterized. Phage TPW22 was propagated lytically on L. lactis subsp. cremoris 3107, which could also be lysogenized by site-specific integration. The attachment site (attP), 5'-TAAGGCGACGGTCG-3', of phage TPW22 was present on a 7.5-kb EcoRI fragment, a 3.4-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment of which was sequenced. Sequence information revealed the presence of an integrase gene (int). The deduced amino acid sequence showed 42 and 28% identity with integrases of streptococcal and lactococcal phages, respectively. The identities with these integrase-encoding genes were 52 and 45%, respectively, at the nucleotide level. This could indicate horizontal gene transfer. A stable integration vector containing attP and int was constructed, and integration in L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 was obtained. The existence of an exchangeable lactococcal phage integration module was suggested. The proposed module covers the phage attachment site, the integrase gene, and surrounding factor-independent terminator structures. The phages phiLC3, TP901-1, and TPW22 all have different versions of this module. Phylogenetically, the TPW22 Int links the phiLC3 lactococcal integrase with known Streptococcus thermophilus integrases.
TI  - A protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria derived from hrcA, a unique heat-shock regulatory gene.
AB  - The dnaK operon from Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria with low  G + C DNA content contains additional heat-shock genes, including hrcA. The hrcA gene encodes a transcription factor that negatively regulates heat-shock genes and is uniformly present in all Gram-positive bacteria studied to date. An hrcA homologue is also present in Synechocystis species, Leptospira interrogans, Chlamydia trachomatis, Caulobacter crescentus and Methanococcus jannaschii, organisms that diverged early on from the common ancestor of all Gram-positive bacteria and Proteobacteria, according to 16S rRNA phylogeny. A partial, protein-based phylogenetic tree, derived using amino acid sequence homology of hrcA proteins from Gram-positive bacteria, is presented here, and the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. The location of the hrcA gene and the genome organization of the dnaK operon support the division of all Gram-positive bacteria into three major groups: one group contains high-G + C Gram-positive bacteria, and two others contain low-G + C Gram-positive bacteria. Among the Gram-positive bacteria with low G + C DNA content, the results indicate that there is a close phylogenetic relationship between Bacillus species and Clostridium species on the one hand and between Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus mutans on the other. Streptomyces and Mycobacterium species also exhibited a close relationship. A hierarchical arrangement of Gram-positive bacteria based on HrcA sequences is proposed as an additional refinement of the phylogenetic relationships within this important bacterial group.
TI  - Characterization in vitro and in vivo of a new HU family protein from Streptococcus thermophilus ST11.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic gram-positive bacterium belonging to the lactic acid group. We report the isolation and characterization of a new 9.6-kDa DNA-binding protein, HSth, belonging to the HU family of nucleoid-associated proteins. The hsth gene was isolated in a 2.5-kb genomic region, upstream of a gene with strong homology to Lactococcus lactis pyrD. It is transcribed from a single E. coli sigma(70)-like promoter. Based on its high level of sequence similarity to B. subtilis and E. coli HU, HSth appears to be an HU homologue. The HSth protein shows biochemical and functional properties typical of HU proteins from gram-positive bacteria, being heat-stable, acid-soluble, and homodimeric. When expressed in HU-deficient E. coli cells, HSth supported the growth of bacteriophage Mu as efficiently as E. coli HU homo- and heterodimeric proteins. It did not, however, display any IHF-specific functions. Finally, we show that HSth binds to linear DNA with no apparent specificity, forming protein-DNA complexes similar but not identical to those observed with E. coli HU proteins.
TI  - In vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (Amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  - It has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and strains of Eubacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. In fact, C. butyricum and Bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. Starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides cells and were extracellular for C. butyricum. Active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on SDS-PAGE gels showed that the Bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (M(r)) weights (>160,000), medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). It was concluded that Bifidobacterium spp. and C. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.
TI  - Multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases encoded by the genes prtB of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, prtH of Lactobacillus helveticus, prtP of Lactococcus lactis, scpA of Streptococcus pyogenes and csp of Streptococcus agalactiae have been compared using multiple sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and database homology searching methods. This comparative analysis has led to the prediction of a number of different domains in these cell-envelope proteinases, and their homology, characteristics and putative function are described. These domains include, starting from the N-terminus, a pre-pro-domain for secretion and activation, a serine protease domain (with a smaller inserted domain), two large middle domains A and B of unknown but possibly regulatory function, a helical spacer domain, a hydrophilic cell-wall spacer or attachment domain, and a cell-wall anchor domain. Not all domains are present in each cell-envelope proteinase, suggesting that these multi-domain proteins are the result of gene shuffling and domain swapping during evolution.
TI  - Low-redundancy sequencing of the entire Lactococcus lactis IL1403 genome.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is an AT-rich gram positive bacterium phylogenetically close to the genus Streptococcus. Various strains of L. lactis are used in dairy industry as starters for cheese making. L. lactis is also one of the well characterized laboratory microorganisms, widely used for studies on physiology of lactic acid bacteria. We describe here a low redundancy sequence of the genome of the strain L. lactis IL1403. The strategy which we followed to determine the sequence consists of two main steps. First, a limited number of plasmids and lambda-phages that carry random segments of the genome were sequenced. Second, sequences of the inserts were used for production of novel sequencing templates by applying Multiplex Long Accurate PCR protocols. Using of these PCR products allowed to determine the sequence of the entire 2.35 Mb genome with a very low redundancy, close to 2. The error rate of the sequence is estimated to be below 1%. The correctness of the sequence assembly was confirmed by PCR amplification of the entire L. lactis IL1403 genome, using a set of 266 oligonucleotides. Anotation of the sequence was undertaken by using automatic gene prediction computer tools. This allowed to identify 1495 protein-encoding genes, to locate them on the genome map and to classify their functions on the basis of homology to known proteins. The function of about 700 genes expected to encode proteins that lack homologs in data bases cannot be reliably predicted in this way. The approach which we used eliminates high redundancy sequencing and mapping efforts, needed to obtain detailed and comprehensive genetic and physical maps of a bacterium. Availability of detailed genetic and physical maps of the L. lactis IL1403 genome provides many entries to study metabolism and physiology of bacteria from this group. The presence of 42 copies of five different IS elements in the IL1403 genome confirms the importance of these elements for genetic exchange in Lactococci. These include two previously unknown elements, present at seven and fifteen copies and designated IS1077 and IS983, respectively. Five potential or rudimentary prophages were identified in the genome by detecting clusters of phage-related genes. The metabolic and regulatory potential of L. lactis was evaluated by inspecting gene sets classified into different functional categories. L. lactis has the genetic potential to synthesise 20 standard amino acids, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and at least four cofactors. Some of these metabolites, which are usually present in chemically defined media, can probably be omitted. About twenty compounds can be used by L. lactis as a sole carbon source. Some 83 regulators were revealed, indicating a regulatory potential close to that of Haemophilus influenzae, a bacterium with a similar genome size. Unexpectedly, L. lactis has a complete set of late competence genes, which may have concerted transcriptional regulation and unleadered polycistronic mRNAs. These findings open new possibilities for developing genetic tools, useful for studies of gene regulation in AT-rich gram positive bacteria and for engineering of new strains for the diary industry.
TI  - The natural food grade inhibitor, lacticin 3147, reduced the incidence of mastitis after experimental challenge with Streptococcus dysgalactiae in nonlactating dairy cows.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by the food-grade organism Lactococcus lactis. Lacticin 3147 is active at a neutral pH and has been shown to be bactericidal to streptococci and staphylococci in vitro. The effectiveness of an intramammary teat seal formulation, and a teat seal containing lacticin 3147 was evaluated at drying off in 68 uninfected quarters of 18 cows. Following infusion of either teat seal or lacticin 3147 combined with teat seal, a deliberate infection challenge of Streptococcus dysgalactiae (approximately equal to 1.5 x 10(4) cfu per teat) was administered by direct inoculation into the teat sinus. During an 8-d experimental period following inoculation, 61% of control quarters and 6% of the treatment quarters either developed clinical mastitis or were shedding the challenge organism. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction genetic typing was used to confirm that both the new infections and the bacteria surviving in the teats at the end of the experiment were the challenge strain. The combination of teat seal and lacticin 3147 was well tolerated within the udder and elicited only a temporary increase in somatic cell count to 5.7 x 10(5)/ml (88 h after infusion) in a previously uninfected lactating udder quarter. Therefore, we concluded that this nonantibiotic approach to mastitis prevention may contribute to a reduction in the routine application of antibiotics at drying off in the future.
TI  - Functional analysis of glycosyltransferase genes from Lactococcus lactis and other gram-positive cocci: complementation, expression, and diversity.
AB  - Sixteen exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing Lactococcus lactis strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their EPSs and the locations, sequences, and organization of the eps genes involved in EPS biosynthesis. This allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in detail. Previously, we have characterized the eps gene cluster of strain NIZO B40 (group I) and determined the function of three of its glycosyltransferase (GTF) genes. Fragments of the eps gene clusters of strains NIZO B35 (group II) and NIZO B891 (group III) were cloned, and these encoded the NIZO B35 priming galactosyltransferase, the NIZO B891 priming glucosyltransferase, and the NIZO B891 galactosyltransferase involved in the second step of repeating-unit synthesis. The NIZO B40 priming glucosyltransferase gene epsD was replaced with an erythromycin resistance gene, and this resulted in loss of EPS production. This epsD deletion was complemented with priming GTF genes from gram-positive organisms with known function and substrate specificity. Although no EPS production was found with priming galactosyltransferase genes from L. lactis or Streptococcus thermophilus, complementation with priming glucosyltransferase genes involved in L. lactis EPS and Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule biosynthesis could completely restore or even increase EPS production in L. lactis.
TI  - Cold shock proteins and low-temperature response of Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302.
AB  - Low-temperature adaptation and cryoprotection were studied in the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302. S. thermophilus actively adapts to freezing during a pretreatment at 20 degrees C, resulting in an approximately 1, 000-fold increased survival after four freeze-thaw cycles compared to mid-exponential-phase cells grown at an optimal temperature of 42 degrees C. No adaptation is observed when cells are exposed to a temperature (10 degrees C) below the minimal growth temperature of the strain (just below 15 degrees C). By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis several 7-kDa cold-induced proteins were identified, which are the major induced proteins after a shift to 20 degrees C. These cold shock proteins were maximally expressed at 20 degrees C, while the induction level was low after cold shock to 10 degrees C. To confirm the presence of csp genes in S. thermophilus, a PCR strategy was used which yielded products of different sizes. Sequence analysis revealed csp-like sequences that were up to 95% identical to those of csp genes of S. thermophilus ST1-1, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactococcus lactis. Northern blot analysis revealed a seven- to ninefold induction of csp mRNA after a temperature shift to 20 degrees C, showing that this thermophilic bacterium indeed contains at least one cold-inducible csp gene and that its regulation takes place at the transcriptional level.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  - Production of pediocin in Pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pMBR1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. These four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. We have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter ST(P2201) from Streptococcus thermophilus, and repA from the 2-kbp S. thermophilus plasmid pER8. The recombinant plasmid, pPC318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in Escherichia coli. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with pPC418, a modified vector fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. Pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. The expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.
TI  - PepS from Streptococcus thermophilus. A new member of the aminopeptidase T family of thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - The proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria is essential for bacterial growth  in milk but also for the development of the organoleptic properties of dairy products. Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry. In comparison with the model lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, S. thermophilus possesses two additional peptidases (an oligopeptidase and the aminopeptidase PepS). To understand how S. thermophilus grows in milk, we purified and characterized this aminopeptidase. PepS is a monomeric metallopeptidase of approximately 45 kDa with optimal activity in the range pH 7.5-8.5 and at 55 degrees C on Arg-paranitroanilide as substrate. PepS exhibits a high specificity towards peptides possessing arginine or aromatic amino acids at the N-terminus. From the N-terminal protein sequence of PepS, we deduced degenerate oligonucleotides and amplified the corresponding gene by successive PCR reactions. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the PepS gene has high identity (40-50%) with the aminopeptidase T family from thermophilic and extremophilic bacteria; we thus propose the classification of PepS from S. thermophilus as a new member of this family. In view of its substrate specificity, PepS could be involved both in bacterial growth by supplying amino acids, and in the development of dairy products' flavour, by hydrolysing bitter peptides and liberating aromatic amino acids which are important precursors of aroma compounds.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the streptococcin A-FF22 lantibiotic regulon: model for production of the lantibiotic SA-FF22 by strains of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Streptococcin A-FF22 (SA-FF22) is a type AII linear lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus pyogenes strain FF22. Sequence analysis of an approximate 10 kb region of DNA showed it to contain nine open reading frames arranged in three operons responsible for regulation, biosynthesis and immunity of SA-FF22. This region is organized similarly to the Lactococcus lactis lacticin 481 region, however, unlike lacticin 481, a two-component regulatory system is essential for SA-FF22 production. Located immediately downstream of the scn region is a putative transposase gene, the presence of which supports earlier data that indicated a mobile nature to this region.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Introduction of the exopolysaccharide gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 into Lactococcus lactis MG1363: production and characterization of an altered polysaccharide.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 produces an exopolysaccharide (EPS) composed of glucose, galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine in the molar ratio of 1:2:1. The genes responsible for the EPS biosynthesis have been isolated previously and found to be clustered in a 14.5 kb region encoding 13 genes. Transfer of this gene cluster into a non-EPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363, yielded an EPS with a similar high molecular weight, but a different structure from the EPS from the native host. The structure of the recombinant EPS was determined by means of 1H homonuclear and 1H-13C heteronuclear two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and was found to be --> 3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-D-Galp-(1 --> 3)-beta-D-Galp-(1 --> as opposed to --> 3)[alpha-D-Galp-(1 --> 6)]-beta-D-Glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1 --> 3)-beta-D-Galp-(1 --> for the wild-type S. thermophilus Sfi6. Furthermore, L. lactis MG1363 (pFS101) was also lacking a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine C4-epimerase activity, which would provide UDP-GalNAc for a GalNAc incorporation into the EPS and probably caused the substitution of GalNAc by Gal in the recombinant EPS. This modification implies that (i) bacterial glycosyltransferases could potentially have multiple specificities for the donor and the acceptor sugar molecule; and (ii) the repeating unit polymerase can recognize and polymerize a repeating unit that differs in the backbone as well as in the side-chain from its native substrate.
TI  - Are horizontal transfers involved in the evolution of the Streptococcus thermophilus exopolysaccharide synthesis loci?
AB  - A 32.5kb variable locus of the Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 chromosome, the eps locus, contains 25 ORF and seven insertion sequences (IS). The putative products of 17 ORF are related to proteins involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides in various bacteria. The two distal regions and a small central region of the eps locus are constant and present in all or almost all of the S. thermophilus strains tested. The other regions are variable and present in only some S. thermophilus strains tested, particularly in the closely related strains CNRZ368 and A054. A 13.6kb variable region of the eps locus of S. thermophilus CNRZ368 contains two ORF that are almost identical to epsL and orfY of the eps locus of Lactococcus lactis NIZOB40 and seven IS belonging to four different families, ISS1, IS981, IS1193 and IS1194. Five of these sequences were probably acquired by horizontal transfer from L. lactis (Bourgoin, F., et al., 1996. Gene 178, 15-23). Three probes of this 13.6kb region hybridized with the DNA of several L. lactis strains tested. A specific probe for another sequence within the S. thermophilus eps locus, epsF, hybridized with the DNA of one of the L. lactis strains tested. Sequence comparisons also suggest that five ORF of the eps locus have a mosaic structure and probably result from recombinations between sequences that are 10 to 50% divergent. The chimeric structure of the eps locus suggests a very complex evolution. This evolution probably involves both the acquisition of the 13.6kb region from L. lactis by horizontal transfer and exchanges within the S. thermophilus species.
TI  - Lacticin 3147 displays activity in buffer against gram-positive bacterial pathogens which appear insensitive in standard plate assays.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. The reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Pneumococcus, Propionibacterium acne and Streptococcus mutans. This extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.
TI  - [Comparative study of the homology of DNA in thermophilic and mesophilic lactococcal strains of various origin].
AB  - A comparative study of DNA homology among 12 strains of thermophilic streptococci currently used as ferments in the dairy industry in different regions of the CIS and 16 strains of mesophilic lactococci obtained from different sources was performed by the method of optical reassociation in solution. These strains were found to form three groups with DNA homology generally not exceeding 30-35% between each other. These data indicate that strains commonly classified as Streptococcus thermophilus may belong to different taxa. At the same time, the DNA base composition was similar in all these strains (the G + C content was 38-40 mol %). Among 16 strains of mesophilic lactococci DNA homology was generally higher than 50%, i.e., all these strains indeed belong to the same species, Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria growth promoters from Spirulina platensis.
AB  - Spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. Some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, MRS and RM, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of Spirulina platensis in Zarrouk medium. In both MRS and RM media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic acid bacteria assayed. This stimulatory effect was observed in media with pH adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. No effect was observed in minimal saline medium.
TI  - Nisin independent induction of the nisA promoter in Lactococcus lactis during growth in lactose or galactose.
AB  - Nisin biosynthesis is autoregulated extracellularly by the mature and modified peptide. To investigate other regulatory effects on nisin biosynthesis, a transcription fusion of the nisA promoter from Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454 to the promoterless lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus was constructed. This fusion construct, pDOC99, expressed beta-galactosidase in L. lactis ATCC 11454 growing in M17 medium containing glucose (M17G). Consistent with the known model for transcription of nisA, pDOC99 did not express beta-galactosidase in the non-nisin producer, L. lactis LM0230 grown in M17G, unless the nisRK genes (cloned in pDOC23) were included in trans and nisin was added to the medium. Growth of this strain in M17 containing lactose or galactose, resulted in nisA transcription, even in the absence of exogenous nisin. This expression was independent of pDOC23. Furthermore, nisA transcription in L. lactis LM0230(pDOC99) grown in M17G could be induced by the addition of exogenous galactose, with maximum induction occurring at concentrations > 5 mM.
TI  - Persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dairy fermentation systems.
AB  - We examined (i) the persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of E. coli O157:H7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, RpoS, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the yogurt production process. In commercial products inoculated with 10(3) CFU/ml, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (pH 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (pH 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) CFU/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (pH 4.1). For the starter culture competition trials, the relative inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture mixture, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus R110 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis D280 alone, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris D62 alone, and Streptococcus thermophilus C90 alone showing the least inhibition. Recovery of the rpoS mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. No E. coli O157:H7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) CFU/ml. Our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of E. coli O157:H7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce E. coli O157:H7 CFU numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the RpoS protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.
TI  - Production of cholera toxin B subunit in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The intracellular expression of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was first achieved in Lactobacillus paracasei LbTGS1.4 with an expression cassette including the P25 promoter of Streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed L. pentosus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhD). Secretion of CTB was next attempted in L. paracasei LbTGS1.4 and L. plantarum NCIMB8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis Usp45 and PrtP, Enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and S. pyogenes M6 protein). Host-dependent secretion of CTB was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable CTB in the extracellular fraction of L. paracasei LbTGS1.4, secretion of CTB molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in L. plantarum NCIMB8826.
TI  - Distribution of plasmid-borne stress protein genes in Streptococcus thermophilus  and other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The presence of heat stress protein genes (hsp) was tested by Southern hybridization analysis in total DNA extracts from species of the genus Streptococcus (47 strains), Lactobacillus (34 strains), Lactococcus (24 strains), and Leuconostoc (5 strains). The biotinylated hsp16.4 probe prepared from an ORF2 fragment of pER341 (2.8 kb) tested positively with restricted DNA extracts of seven Streptococcus thermophilus strains and a single strain of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. In all positive S. thermophilus strains, the hsp was located on plasmids ranging from ca. 2.8 kb to 11 kb in size, while hsp was present in a 7.5-kb plasmid in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. Southern blots with a rep probe showed that all hsp16.4+ plasmids in S. thermophilus strains also shared homology with the replication function (rep) of pER341, suggesting the common origin of these plasmids.
TI  - Use of a broad-host-range bacteriocin-producing Lactococcus lactis transconjugant as an alternative starter for salami manufacture.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis DPC4268 is widely used for Cheddar cheese manufacture in Ireland where it is recognised for its reliable fast acid producing ability in dairy environments. A transconjugant of this strain, L. lactis DPC4275, was generated which produces the broad spectrum, two-component bacteriocin lacticin 3147, which is inhibitory to a variety of undesirable gram-positive bacteria including Clostridium, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Listeria, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Both DPC4268 and DPC4275 were used as single strain starters for manufacture of salamis. These products were compared with a salami manufactured with a conventional starter (Lactobacillus sake and Staphylococcus carnosus) in terms of pH development, a(w)-value, weight loss, colour development and sensory characteristics. Salamis produced with either lactococcal culture exhibited pH values below 5.1 and a(w)-values below 0.90 which is favourable for preservation and hygienic stability. In addition, these salamis had good sensory and colorimetric qualities. A minimum lacticin 3147 concentration of 640 AU/g was detected in the salamis which were produced with L. lactis DPC4275.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Binding properties of Streptococcus gordonii SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated SspA (1,542 amino acid residues) and SspB (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. These polypeptides are members of the antigen I/II family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as Actinomyces naeslundii. To determine if SspA and SspB have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspA and sspB genes were cloned into expression plasmid vector pTREX1-usp45LS to generate pTREX1-sspA and pTREX1-sspB, respectively, and the Ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface SspA or SspB polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen I/II polypeptide substrates. More than twice as many L. lactis cells expressing SspA bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (SAG) as did L. lactis cells expressing SspB. In contrast, lactococci expressing SspB adhered twice as well as lactococci producing SspA to collagen type I and to Candida albicans. The binding of A. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of Ssp polypeptides. L. lactis(pTREX1-sspB) cells bound in greater numbers to SAG than did Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 cells expressing SspB from pAM401EB-5. The results suggest that SspA and SspB have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by S. gordonii.
TI  - Use of the lactococcal nisA promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  - We characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisA promoter in strains of the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. nisA promoter activity was dependent on the proteins NisR and NisK, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the extracellular inducer nisin. The nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. Significant induction of the nisA promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is inhibited. The efficiency of the nisA promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the Spac, xylA, and lacA promoters in B. subtilis and in S. pyogenes. Because nisA promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.
TI  - Cofactor engineering: a novel approach to metabolic engineering in Lactococcus lactis by controlled expression of NADH oxidase.
AB  - NADH oxidase-overproducing Lactococcus lactis strains were constructed by cloning the Streptococcus mutans nox-2 gene, which encodes the H2O-forming NADH oxidase, on the plasmid vector pNZ8020 under the control of the L. lactis nisA promoter. This engineered system allowed a nisin-controlled 150-fold overproduction of NADH oxidase at pH 7.0, resulting in decreased NADH/NAD ratios under aerobic conditions. Deliberate variations on NADH oxidase activity provoked a shift from homolactic to mixed-acid fermentation during aerobic glucose catabolism. The magnitude of this shift was directly dependent on the level of NADH oxidase overproduced. At an initial growth pH of 6.0, smaller amounts of nisin were required to optimize NADH oxidase overproduction, but maximum NADH oxidase activity was twofold lower than that found at pH 7.0. Nonetheless at the highest induction levels, levels of pyruvate flux redistribution were almost identical at both initial pH values. Pyruvate was mostly converted to acetoin or diacetyl via alpha-acetolactate synthase instead of lactate and was not converted to acetate due to flux limitation through pyruvate dehydrogenase. The activity of the overproduced NADH oxidase could be increased with exogenously added flavin adenine dinucleotide. Under these conditions, lactate production was completely absent. Lactate dehydrogenase remained active under all conditions, indicating that the observed metabolic effects were only due to removal of the reduced cofactor. These results indicate that the observed shift from homolactic to mixed-acid fermentation under aerobic conditions is mainly modulated by the level of NADH oxidation resulting in low NADH/NAD+ ratios in the cells.
TI  - The -16 region of Bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacterial promoters.
AB  - The Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase promoter amy P contains an essential TGTG motif (-16 region) upstream of the -10 region. Mutations of this region significantly reduced in vitro promoter strength. A -15 G-->C transversion eliminated transcription from amy P by both B.subtilis and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP). A second alpha-amylase promoter ( amy P2) also required the -16 region for function. To determine conserved sequences in promoters containing -16 region elements, sequences of 64 B.subtilis promoters with the second TG motif of the -16 region were aligned and analyzed. Unlike the E.coli class of 'extended -10 promoters', with a similar TG motif but lacking a -35 region, the -16 region promoters contain highly conserved -35 regions. They also contain conserved A n and T n tracts upstream of the -35 region. In addition, we analyzed all available gram-positive bacterial promoter compilations to determine the generality of the -16 region. From this analysis, the -16 region TRTG motif (R = purine) appears to be a basic element found in a large portion of gram-positive bacterial promoters and is, in the case of at least the alpha-amylase promoters, necessary for transcription by the major form of B.subtilis and E.coli RNAP.
TI  - Characterization of a novel insertion sequence, IS1194, in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - A novel insertion sequence, IS1194, has been identified in the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368. This 1200-bp element has 16-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The single large open reading frame of this element encodes a 332-amino-acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS5 group of the IS4 family. A single copy of IS1194 was detected by hybridization in only 2 of the 19 S. thermophilus strains tested and in 4 of the 13 Lactococcus lactis strains investigated. This suggests that this IS element was acquired by horizontal transfer. The unique IS1194 copy of S. thermophilus CNRZ368 is located in a region of at least 12 kb that was probably acquired by horizontal transfer from L. lactis. Furthermore, the IS1194 right end is identical to sequences found in a broad-host-range conjugative plasmid from Streptococcus pyogenes, pSM19035.
TI  - Detection and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris R isolated from radish.
AB  - Bacteria isolated from radish were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris R and their bacteriocin was designated lactococcin R. Lactococcin R was sensitive to some proteolytic enzymes (proteinase-K, pronase-E, proteases, pepsin, alpha-chymotrypsin) but was resistant to trypsin, papain, catalase, lysozyme and lipase, organic solvents, or heating at 90 degrees C for 15, 30 and 60 min, or 121 degrees C for 15 min. Lactococcin R remained active after storage at -20 and -70 degrees C for 3 months and after exposure to a pH of 2-9. The molecular weight of lactococcin R was about 2.5 kDa. Lactococcin R was active against many food-borne pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria such as Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Listeria, Bacillus, Micrococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Pediococcus spp., but was not active against any Gram-negative bacteria. Lactococcin R was produced during log phase and reached a maximum activity (1600 AU ml-1) at early stationary phase. The highest lactococcin R production was obtained in MRS broth with 0.5% glucose, at 6.5-7.0 initial pH values, 30 degrees C temperature and 18-24-h incubation times. Lactococcin R adsorbed maximally to its heat-killed producing cells at pH 6-7 (95%). Crude lactococcin R at 1280 AU ml-1 was bactericidal, reducing colony counts of Listeria monocytogenes by 99.98% in 3 h. Lactococcin R should be useful as a biopreservative to prevent growth of food-borne pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria in ready-to-eat, dairy, meat, poultry and other food products. Lactococcin R differs from nisin in having a lower molecular weight, 2.5 kDa vs 3.4 kDa, and in being sensitive to pepsin and alpha-chymotrypsin to which nisin is resistant.
TI  - Evaluation of lacticin 3147 and a teat seal containing this bacteriocin for inhibition of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147 which is bactericidal against a range of mastitis-causing streptococci and staphylococci. In this study, both lacticin 3147 and the lantibiotic nisin were separately incorporated into an intramammary teat seal product. The seal containing lacticin 3147 exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity and might form the basis of an improved treatment for the prevention of mastitis in dry cows.
TI  - Identification of Lactococcus garvieae by PCR.
AB  - Lactococcus garvieae junior synonym Enterococcus seriolicida) is an emerging zoonotic agent isolated from economically important fish (rainbow trout and yellowtail), from cattle, and from humans. Clindamycin susceptibility is the only phenotypic test which can differentiate L. garvieae from Lactococcus lactis, another emerging agent in humans. A PCR assay for the identification of L. garvieae was developed and resulted in an amplified fragment of 1,100 bp in size. The PCR assay was shown to be specific to L. garvieae. The PCR assay was positive for all the L. garvieae strains tested, which originated from three different continents (Asia, Australia, and Europe). The PCR assay was negative for the phenotypically similar L. lactis and for all the other fish pathogens tested, including Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas salmonicida. The PCR assay was applied to plasma obtained from diseased animals and was found sensitive enough to detect bacteria from 1 microl of plasma. The PCR assay that was developed is the only practical test besides the clindamycin test which can specifically identify the zoonotic agent L. garvieae and which can differentiate it from L. lactis.
TI  - Molecular ecology and evolution of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages--a review.
AB  - Bacteriophages attacking Streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium used in milk fermentation, are a threat to the dairy industry. These small isometric-headed phages possess double-stranded DNA genomes of 31 to 45 kb. Yoghurt-derived phages exhibit a limited degree of variability, as defined by restriction pattern and host range, while a large diversity of phage types have been isolated from cheese factories. Despite this diversity all S. thermophilus phages, virulent and temperate, belong to a single DNA homology group. Several mechanisms appear to create genetic variability in this phage group. Site-specific deletions, one type possibly mediated by a viral recombinase/integrase, which transformed a temperate into a virulent phage, were observed. Recombination as a result of superinfection of a lysogenic host has been reported. Comparative DNA sequencing identified up to 10% sequence diversity due to point mutations. Genome sequencing of the prototype temperate phage phi Sfi21 revealed many predicted proteins which showed homology with phages from Lactococcus lactis suggesting horizontal gene transfer. Homology with phages from evolutionary unrelated bacteria like E. coli (e.g. lambdoid phage 434 and P1) and Mycobacterium phi L5 was also found. Due to their industrial importance, the existence of large phage collections, and the whole phage genome sequencing projects which are currently underway, the S. thermophilus phages may present an interesting experimental system to study bacteriophage evolution.
TI  - Evolution of Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes by modular exchanges followed by point mutations and small deletions and insertions.
AB  - Comparative sequence analysis of 40% of the genomes from two prototype Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages (lytic group I phage phi Sfi19 and the cos site containing temperate phage phi Sfi21) suggested two processes in the evolution of their genomes. In a first evolutionarily distant phase the basic genome structure was apparently constituted by modular exchanges. Over the 17-kb-long DNA segment analyzed in the present report, we observed clusters of genes with similarity to genes from Leuconostoc oenos phage L10, Lactococcus lactis phage BK5-T, and Streptococcus pneumoniae phage Dp-1. A chimeric protein was predicted for orf 1291 which showed similarity to both phage BK5-T and phage Dp-1 proteins. The very large orf 1626 gene product showed similarity to two adjacent genes from the Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage LL-H and further phage proteins (Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus subtills). The similarities were localized to distinct parts of this apparently multifunctional protein. The putative phi Sfi19 lysin showed similarity to both lysins of phages and cellular enzymes. In a second, evolutionarily more recent, phase the S, thermophilus phage genomes apparently diversified by point mutations and small deletions/insertions. Over the investigated 17-kb DNA region phi Sfi19 differed from phi Sfi21 by 10% base pair changes, the majority of which were point mutations (mainly at the third codon position), while a third of the base pair differences were contributed by small deletions/insertions. The base pair changes were unevenly distributed. Over the Leuconostoc phage-related DNA the change rate was high, while over the Lactococcus and S. pneumoniae phage-related DNA the change rate was low. We speculate that the degree of base pair change could provide relative time scales for the modular exchange reactions observed in S. thermophilus phages.
TI  - A chloride-inducible acid resistance mechanism in Lactococcus lactis and its regulation.
AB  - Previously, a promoter was identified in Lactococcus lactis that is specifically  induced by chloride. Here, we describe the nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of two genes transcribed from this promoter, gadC and gadB. GadC is homologous to putative glutamate-gamma-aminobutyrate antiporters of Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri and contains 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. GadB shows similarity to glutamate decarboxylases. A L. lactis gadB mutant and a strain that is unable to express both gadB and gadC was more sensitive to low pH than the wild type when NaCl and glutamate were present. Expression of gadCB in L. lactis in the presence of chloride was increased when the culture pH was allowed to decrease to low levels by omitting buffer from the medium, while glutamate also stimulated gadCB expression. Apparently, these genes encode a glutamate-dependent acid resistance mechanism of L. lactis that is optimally active under conditions in which it is needed to maintain viability. Immediately upstream of the chloride-dependent gadCB promoter Pgad, a third gene encodes a protein (GadR) that is homologous to the activator Rgg from Streptococcus gordonii. gadR expression is chloride and glutamate independent. A gadR mutant did not produce the 3kb gadCB mRNA that is found in wild-type cells in the presence of NaCl, indicating that GadR is an activator of the gadCB operon.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a phage-inducible middle promoter and its transcriptional activator from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31.
AB  - An inducible middle promoter from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was isolated previously by shotgun cloning an 888-bp fragment (P15A10) upstream of the beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) gene (lacZ.st) from Streptococcus thermophilus (D. J. O'Sullivan, S. A. Walker, S. G. West, and T. R. Klaenhammer, Bio/Technology 14:82-87, 1996). The promoter showed low levels of constitutive beta-Gal activity which could be induced two- to threefold over baseline levels after phage infection. During this study, the fragment was subcloned and characterized to identify a smaller, tightly regulated promoter fragment which allowed no beta-Gal activity until after phage infection. This fragment, defined within nucleotides 566 to 888 (P(566-888); also called fragment 566-888), contained tandem, phage-inducible transcription start sites at nucleotides 703 and 744 (703/744 start sites). Consensus -10 regions were present upstream of both start sites, but no consensus -35 regions were identified for either start site. A transcriptional activator, encoded by an open reading frame (ORF2) upstream of the 703/744 start sites, was identified for P(566-888). ORF2 activated P(566-888) when provided in trans in Escherichia coli. In addition, when combined with pTRK391 (P15A10::lacZ.st) in Lactococcus lactis NCK203, an antisense ORF2 construct was able to retard induction of the phage-inducible promoter as measured by beta-Gal activity levels. Finally, gel shift assays showed that ORF2 was able to bind to promoter fragment 566-888. Deletion analysis of the region upstream from the tandem promoters identified a possible binding site for transcriptional activation of the phage promoters. The DNA-binding ability of ORF2 was eliminated upon deletion of part of this region, which lies centered approximately 35 bp upstream of start site 703. Deletion analysis and mutagenesis studies also elucidated a critical region downstream of the 703/744 start sites, where mutagenesis resulted in a two- to threefold increase in beta-Gal activity. With these improvements, the level of expression achieved by an explosive-expression strategy was elevated from 3,000 to 11,000 beta-Gal units within 120 min after induction.
TI  - Sequence analysis of mutA and mutM genes involved in the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic mutacin II in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, along with many other gram-positive bacteria produce small  antibacterial peptides called bacteriocins. Bacteriocins elaborated by S. mutans, termed mutacins, may provide a selective force necessary for initial or sustained colonization in dental plaque by this major dental pathogen. Previously, we purified and characterized mutacin II, the first lantibiotic found in S. mutans. Specific oligonucleotides designed according to the N-terminal amino acid sequence permitted amplification of 0.7 kb upstream and 2.1 kb downstream of the N-terminus, using single-specific-primer PCR (SSP-PCR). The gene encoding the mutacin II prepeptide, mutA, was subsequently cloned and sequenced. The complete prepeptide consists of 53 amino acids, including the 26 amino acid amphipathic leader peptide with the Gly(-2)-Gly(-1) sequence at the processing site. The prepeptide showed similarity to the lantibiotics lacticin 481, variacin, salivaricin and streptococcin A-FF22. A 3 kb open reading frame immediately downstream of mutA, denoted mutM, showed sequence similarities to LCNDR2 from Lactococcus lactis. By analogy, mutM is probably involved in post-translational modification of the mutacin prepeptide. Gene disruption with an insertional vector pVA891 showed that intact copies of mutA and mutM are required for production of mutacin II.
TI  - Application of the extracellular alpha-amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis 148  to construction of a secretion vector for yogurt starter strains.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC 19258, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus T-11, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 were transformed with the alpha-amylase gene (amyA) from Streptococcus bovis 148 by using a wide host-range vector, and all the transformants secreted the alpha-amylase successfully. Since the promoter and the secretion signal of the amyA gene were functional in these strains, we constructed a secretion vector using the expression elements of amyA. Trials to secrete foreign enzymes in yogurt starter strains were performed using this novel secretion vector.
TI  - Isolation and overexpression of a gene encoding an extracellular beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis JB1 was found to produce a 25-kDa extracellular enzyme active against beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucans. A gene was isolated encoding a specific beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase that corresponds to this size and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 16. A 4- to 10-fold increase in supernatant beta-glucanase activity was obtained when the cloned beta-glucanase gene was reintroduced into S. bovis JB1 by use of constructs based on the plasmid vector pTRW10 or pIL253. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase gene was also expressed upon introduction of the pTRW10 construct pTRWL1R into Lactococcus lactis IL2661 and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-SS, although extracellular activity was 8- to 50-fold lower than that in S. bovis JB1. The beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase purified from the culture supernatant of S. bovis JB1 carrying pTRWL1R showed a K(m) of 2.8 mg per ml and a Vmax of 338 mumol of glucose equivalents per min per mg of protein with barley beta-glucan as the substrate. The S. bovis beta-(1,3-1,4)-glucanase may contribute to the ability of this bacterium to utilize starch by degrading structural polysaccharides present in endosperm cell walls.
TI  - A computerised system for the identification of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A generic computerised system for the identification of bacteria was developed. The system is equipped with a key to the identification of lactic acid bacteria. The identification is carried out in two steps. The first step distinguishes groups of bacteria by following a decision tree with general identification tests. The second step in the identification is the distinction of species within a group on the basis of biochemical fermentation patterns. During grouping, probabilities for test failure are used. These probabilities can be used for assessing the quality of a given test answer. The probabilities are also used to select the most probable test answer in cases where the test result is inconclusive. The probabilities of test failure were determined by a group of experts and a group of potential users of the identification system. During species identification, similarity indices are calculated for all bacteria in a group. The described identification system has the ability to "learn" from different sessions in the species identification step, improving both identification speed and accuracy. Because of the versatile way in which the system is set up, it can very easily be expanded with identification keys to other organisms.
TI  - A highly conserved DNA replication module from Streptococcus thermophilus phages  is similar in sequence and topology to a module from Lactococcus lactis phages.
AB  - A highly conserved DNA region extending over 5 kb was observed in Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages. Comparative sequencing of one temperate and 26 virulent phages demonstrated in the most extreme case an 18% aa difference for a predicted protein, while the majority of the phages showed fewer, if any aa changes. The relative degree of aa conservation was not homogeneous over the DNA segment investigated. Sequence analysis of the conserved segment revealed genes possibly involved in DNA transactions. Three predicted proteins (orf 233, 443, and 382 gene product (gp)) showed nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. Orf 443 gp showed in addition a DEAH box motif, characteristically found in a subgroup of helicases, and a variant zinc finger motif known from a phage T7 helicase/primase. Tree analysis classified orf 443 gp as a distant member of the helicase superfamily. Orf 382 gp showed similarity to putative plasmid DNA primases. Downstream of orf 382 a noncoding repeat region was identified that showed similarity to a putative minus origin from a cryptic S. thermophilus plasmid. Four predicted proteins showed not only high degrees of aa identity (34 to 63%) with proteins from Lactococcus lactis phages, but their genes showed a similar topological organization. We interpret this as evidence for a horizontal gene transfer event between phages of the two bacterial genera in the distant past.
TI  - The lytic enzyme of the pneumococcal phage Dp-1: a chimeric lysin of intergeneric origin.
AB  - We have localized, cloned and characterized the genes coding for the lytic system of the pneumococcal phage Dp-1. The lytic enzyme of this phage (Pal), previously identified as an N-acetyl-muramoyl-L-alanine amidase, shows a modular organization similar to that described for the lytic enzymes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages. The construction of chimeric enzymes between pneumococcus and bacteria (or phages) that belong to different Gram-positive families has shown that the interchange of functional domains switches enzyme specificity. Interestingly, Pal appears to be a natural chimeric enzyme of intergeneric origin, that is the N-terminal domain was highly similar to that of the murein hydrolase coded by a gene found in the phage BK5-T that infects Lactococcus lactis, whereas the C-terminal domain was homologous to those found in the lytic enzymes of the pneumococcal system that is responsible for the binding to the choline residues present in the cell wall substrate. Biochemical analysis of Pal revealed that this enzyme shares important properties with those of the major LytA101 autolysin found in an atypical, clinical pneumococcal isolate. These peculiar characteristics have been ascribed to a modified C-terminal domain. The natural chimeric enzyme described here provides further support for the theory of modular evolution of proteins and its characteristics also furnish interesting clues on the molecular mechanisms involved in the more invasive types of atypical pneumococci.

TI  - The pneumococcal cell wall degrading enzymes: a modular design to create new lysins?
AB  - Autolysins are enzymes that degrade different bonds in the peptidoglycan and, eventually, cause the lysis and death of the cell. Streptococcus pneumoniae contains a powerful autolytic enzyme that has been characterized as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. We have cloned the lytA gene coding for this amidase and studied in depth the genetics and expression of this gene, which represented the first molecular analysis of a bacterial autolysin. Two observations have been fundamental in revealing further knowledge on the lytic systems of pneumococcus: (a) The well-documented dependence of the pneumococcal autolysin on the presence of choline in the cell wall for activity, and (b) the early observation that most pneumococcal phages also required the presence of this amino-alcohol in the growth medium to achieve a successful liberation of the phage progeny. We concluded that choline would serve as an element of strong selective pressure to preserve certain structures of the host and phage lytic enzymes which should lead to sequence homologies. We constructed active chimeras between the lytic enzymes of S. pneumoniae and its bacteriophages using genes that share sequence homology as well as genes that completely lack homologous regions. In this way, we demonstrated that the pneumococcal lytic enzymes are the result of the fusion of two independent functional modules where the carboxy-terminal domain might be responsible for the specific recognition of choline-containing cell walls whereas the active center of these enzymes should be localized in the N-terminal part of the protein. The modular design postulated for the pneumococcal lysins seems to be a widespread model for many types of microbial proteins and the construction of functional chimeric proteins between the lytic enzymes of pneumococcus and those of several gram-positive microorganisms, like Clostridium acetobutylicum or Lactococcus lactis, provided interesting clues on the modular evolution of proteins. The study of several genes coding for the lytic enzymes of temperate phages of pneumococcus also highlighted on some evolutionary relationships between microorganisms. We suggest that lysogenic relationships may represent a common mechanism by which pathogenic organisms like pneumococcus should undergo a rapid adaptation to an evolving environment.
TI  - Identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  - When Lactic Acid Bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees C for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees C for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and Pediococcus pentosaceus PO2 (18%), but not for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of Lactobacillus helveticus LB1 and Streptococcus thermophilus TS2. When the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. Use of degenerate PCR primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis resulted in PCR products from all strains tested. The PCR product from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis M474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. Use of PCR primers based on the M474 sequence resulted in PCR products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not from the Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, or Pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.
TI  - Presence of additional peptidases in Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 302 compared to Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry but little is known about its peptidase system. The aim of this study was to determine the biochemical and genetic characteristics of this system, and to compare it to the well known system of Lactococcus lactis. We separated the intracellular proteins of Strep. thermophilus CNRZ 302 and L. lactis NCDO 763 by ion-exchange chromatography and we detected the activity of the different types of peptidases. In both L. lactis and Strep. thermophilus strains, we showed 13 different peptidase activities with biochemical homologies between both species. Streptococcus thermophilus also possessed two peptidases which we did not find in L. lactis: an aminopeptidase and an oligopeptidase. We performed Southern blot experiments and among the eight peptidase genes tested, only the genes encoding the general aminopeptidases, pepC and pepN, were homologous between the L. lactis and Strep. thermophilus strains. Besides biochemical and genetic similarities, the peptidase systems of Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis thus differed by the presence of additional peptidases in Strep. thermophilus.
TI  - Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB.
TI  - Use of an excision reporter plasmid to study the intracellular mobility of the conjugative transposon Tn916 in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - An excision reporter plasmid was constructed to characterize the intracellular mobility of Tn916 in various Gram-positive bacteria. The reporter component of this plasmid is a chloramphenicol-resistance gene which has been insertionally inactivated with the integrative vector pAT112 containing the attachment site of Tn916. Tn916-mediated excision of pAT112, to produce clones resistant to chloramphenicol, was detected in Enterococcus faecalis BM4110, Listeria monocytogenes L028-Str and Streptococcus gordonii BM120, but not in Lactococcus lactis MG1363-RF or in Streptococcus pneumoniae BM124, and always depended upon the ability of the bacterial host to generate circular forms of the transposon. The results suggest that (i) the excision event, although required, is not sufficient for conjugal transfer to occur and (ii) there is no linear relationship between the donor potential of E. faecalis strains and either the excision frequency of pAT112 or the copy number of Tn916 circular intermediates per cell in these hosts. Excision of pAT112 occurred mainly during the late exponential phase of growth of E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes and this recombination event was not stimulated by heat shock, salt and alcohol stresses or by the presence of tetracycline in the medium.
TI  - Characterization of a thiol-dependent endopeptidase from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32.
AB  - An endopeptidase gene (pepE) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32. The pepE gene consisted of a 1,314-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 52.1 kDa. Significant identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence of pepE and the sequences for aminopeptidase C from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290, L. helveticus CNRZ32, Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris AM2. A recombinant PepE fusion protein containing an N-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Characterization of PepE revealed that it was a thiol-dependent protease having a monomeric mass of 50 kDa, with optimum temperature, NaCl concentration, and pH for activity at 32 to 37 degrees C, 0.5%, and 4.5, respectively. PepE had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of ripening cheese (10 degrees C, 4% NaCl, pH 5.1). PepE hydrolyzed internal peptide bonds in Met-enkephalin and bradykinin; however, hydrolysis of alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins was not detected.
TI  - Primary and secondary structures of rRNA spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  - The 16S-23S and 23S-5S rRNA spacer DNA regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus mundtii were amplified by PCR. Their nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. Whereas lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without tRNA(Ala) were characterized. However, as shown for lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto, the tRNA(Ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal CCA trinucleotide. A putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the tRNA(Ala) gene. Based on comparison with Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. In E, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no tRNA(Ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. A similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in E. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. Such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23S rRNA coding sequences of some Gram-negative bacteria. The spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the tRNA(Ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of DNA-based typing methods.
TI  - Plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - Bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. During lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host chromosome at the 3' end of a tRNA(Ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (L. Dupont et al., J. Bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). A nonreplicative vector (pMC1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attP site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei (two strains), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Integrative recombination of pMC1 into the chromosomes of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pMC1 attP site. The isolation and sequencing of pMC1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pMC1 integrated into the conserved tRNA(Ser) gene. In the other bacterial species where this tRNA gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic DNA were used. A consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. The comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide CCT at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.
TI  - The lac operon of Lactobacillus casei contains lacT, a gene coding for a protein  of the Bg1G family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  - The 5' region of the lac operon of Lactobacillus casei has been investigated. An  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lacT, was identified upstream of lacE. The gene product encoded by lacT is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes BglG from Escherichia coli, ArbG from Erwinia chrysanthemi, SacT, SacY, and LicT from Bacillus subtilis, and BglR from Lactococcus lactis. Amino acid sequence identities range from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. The transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lacT. The corresponding mRNA would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus RNA binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. LacT was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a B. subtilis test system using the sacB target sequence. lacT directly precedes lacEGF, the genes coding for enzyme IICB, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme IIA, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. Northern hybridizations with probes against lacT, lacE, and lacF revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mRNAs of several L. casei strains. Since the length of the lac mRNA is just sufficient to contain lacTEGF, we conclude that the lac operon of L. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, or Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Characterization of a mosaic ISS1 element and evidence for the recent horizontal  transfer of two different types of ISS1 between Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 12-kb region of the Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 chromosome was found to  contain two copies of IS981 (one complete and one truncated) and three copies of ISS1 (two complete, ISS1SA and ISS1SC, and one truncated, delta ISS1SB). Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these ISS1 elements with those of previously identified iso-ISS1 elements from Lactococcus lactis and the Enterococcus genus indicated that the ISS1 group is divided into three distinct subgroups which we have named alpha, beta and gamma. Nucleotide sequences of elements belonging to the same subgroup share more than 97% identity whereas sequences of elements from different groups share only 75-85% identity. Sequence analysis of ISS1SA and delta ISS1SB showed that they are members of the alpha group. We found that ISS1SC from S. themophilus CNRZ368, an ISS1 from L. lactis IL964 and IS946 from L. lactis TEK1 resulted from recombinations between alpha and beta elements. In addition, ISS1W from L. lactis Wg2 resulted from a recombination event between a gamma element and an ISS1 belonging to an unidentified subgroup. ISS1 sequences belonging to the alpha and beta subgroups were found in both S. thermophilus and L. lactis and gamma sequences were found in both the Enterococcus genus and L. lactis. The quasi-identity of some ISS1 elements in S. thermophilus and L. lactis and the distribution of alpha and beta elements suggest that horizontal transfer of ISS1 elements recently took place from L. lactis to S. thermophilus, two lactic acid bacteria used in the manufacture of cheeses. Since the presence of IS981 in S. thermophilus CNRZ368 also probably resulted from a horizontal transfer from L. lactis [Guedon et al. (1995) Mol. Microbiol. 16, 69-78], the 12-kb region bearing IS981 and ISS1 elements could be due to the integration of a lactococcal DNA fragment into the chromosome.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the genes encoding lytic functions  of Bacteriophage phi g1e.
AB  - The lysis genes of a Lactobacillus phage phi g1e were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequencing of a 3813-bp phi g1e DNA revealed five successive open reading frames (ORF), Rorf50, Rorf118, hol, and lys and Rorf175, in the same DNA strand. By comparative analysis of the DNA sequence, the putative hol product (holin) has an estimated molecular weight is 14.2 kDa, and contains two potential transmembrane helices and highly charged N- and C-termini, resembling predicted holins (which are thought to be a cytoplasmic membrane-disrupting protein) encoded by other phages such as mv1 from Lactobacillus bulgaricus, phi adh from Lactobacillus gasseri, as well as monocins from Listeria. On the other hand, the putative phi g1e lys product (lysin) of 48.4 kDa shows significant similarity with presumed muramidase, known as a cell wall peptidoglycandegrading enzyme, encoded by the Lactobacillus phage mv1 and phi adh, the Lactococcus lactis phage phi LC3, and the Streptococcus pneumoniae phages Cp-1, Cp-7 and Cp-9. When expressed in E. coli, the phi g1e lysin and/or holin decreased the cell turbidity significantly, suggesting that the phi g1e hol-lys system is involved in cytolytic process.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria as vaccine delivery vehicles.
AB  
TI  - Genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis  and Streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Carnobacterium, is reviewed. The genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 Mbp. Plasmids are common in Lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. Five IS elements have been found in L. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. IS elements have been found in the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, but not in S. thermophilus. Prophages are also a normal component of the L. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in S. thermophilus. Physical and genetic maps for two L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and S. thermophilus A054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. The L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the S. thermophilus map has 35. The maps indicate significant plasticity in the L. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. The cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. A number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the L. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. These tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. Integration vectors based on temperate phage attB sites and the random insertion of IS elements have also been developed for L. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. In addition, a L. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with Escherichia coli Hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. With the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.
TI  - The effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - beta-Galactosidases from Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, Lb. casei 20094, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, Streptococcus thermophilus TS2, Pediococcus pentosaceus PE39 and Bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. The rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by Mg2+, while the effect of K+ and Na+ differed from strain to strain. The beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. The types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in each case, but the rates of their production differed. All the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, Lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.
TI  - Characterization of PepB, a group B streptococcal oligopeptidase.
AB  - Group B streptococci were recently reported to possess a cell-associated collagenase. Although the enzyme hydrolyzed the synthetic collagen-like substrate N-(3-[2-furyl]acryloyl)-Leu-Gly-Pro-Ala, we found that neither the highly purified enzyme nor crude group B streptococcal cell lysate solubilized a film of reconstituted rat tail collagen, an activity regarded as obligatory for a true collagenase. We cloned and sequenced the gene for the enzyme (pepB). The deduced amino acid sequence showed 66.4% identity to the PepF oligopeptidase from Lactococcus lactis, a member of the M3 or thimet family of zinc metallopeptidases. The group B streptococcal enzyme also showed oligopeptidase activity and degraded a variety of small bioactive peptides, including bradykinin, neurotensin, and peptide fragments of substance P and adrenocorticotropin.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a malic enzyme from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis ATCC 15352 and cloning and sequencing of its gene.
AB  - Malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39), which catalyzes L-malate oxidative decarboxylation and pyruvate reductive carboxylation, was purified to homogeneity from Streptococcus bovis ATCC 15352, and properties of this enzyme were determined. The 2.9-kb fragment containing the malic enzyme gene was cloned, and the sequence was determined and analyzed. The enzymatic properties of the S. bovis malic enzyme were almost identical to those of other malic enzymes previously reported. However, we found that the S. bovis malic enzyme catalyzed unknown enzymatic reactions, including reduction of 2-oxoisovalerate, reduction of 2-oxoisocaproate, oxidation of D-2-hydroxyisovalerate, and oxidation of D-2-hydroxyisocaproate. The requirement for cations and the optimum pH of these unique activities were different from the requirement for cations and the optimum pH of the L-malate oxidative decarboxylating activity. A sequence analysis of the cloned fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames that were 1,299 and 1,170 nucleotides long. The 389-amino-acid polypeptide deduced from the 1,170-nucleotide open reading frame was identified as the malic enzyme; this enzyme exhibited high levels of similarity to malic enzymes of Bacillus stearothermophilus and Haemophilus influenzae and was also similar to other malic enzymes and the malolactic enzyme of Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - [Expression of the PAC gene of S. mutans in S. lactis].
AB  - Expression of the pac gene in S. lactis were analyzed by dot immunoblotting with  rabbit anti-PAc serum. The amount of PAc produced by S. lactis HL107 (pLF107) was measured. This result indicated that a small amount of rPAc was detected in the culture supernatant and cell homogenate of S. lactis HL107 (pLF107) but not in the control strain S. lactis LM0230. The amount of rPAc in S.lacits HL107 (pLF107) was six times lower than that in S. mutans Ingbritt. Expression of cloned pac gene in S. lactis was also confirmed in this result.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Lactococcus lactis and Lactococcus garvieae and a proposed method to discriminate between them.
AB  - The MICs of antimicrobial agents contained in the SCEPTOR Streptococcus MIC panels (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) were determined for Lactococcus lactis, L. garvieae, and unknown Lactococcus species. Several isolates had reduced susceptibilities to many of the antimicrobial agents contained in the panel. For L. garvieae, the MICs of penicillin and, possibly, cephalothin were higher than for L. lactis, and unlike L. lactis, L. garvieae was resistant to clindamycin, indicating that knowledge of the Lactococcus species causing an infection might influence the choice of antimicrobial therapy. Susceptibility to clindamycin can also be used to differentiate between L. lactis and L. garvieae.
TI  - Sequence of a Lactococcus lactis DNA fragment homologous to the recF gene of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The recF gene of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 7962 is located 3 kb downstream from the lacZ gene and is transcribed in the opposite orientation. The recF gene is immediately preceded by a 121-codon ORF, and both recF and orf121 may be transcribed from the same promoter. The deduced RecF amino-acid sequence shows high homology to that of the Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pyogenes RecF proteins.
TI  - Development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  - Bacteriophages against Streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the Italian cheese industry. One possible control method involves replacing S. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. In this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. Because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 25744, P. pentosaceus ATCC 25745, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 12697 by electroporation with pPN-1, a 35-kb Lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. Transformants of P. pentosaceus ATCC 25745 and P. acidilactici ATCC 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. Both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained pPN-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. Paired starter combinations of Pediococcus spp. and Lactobacillus helveticus LH100 exhibited synergistic pH reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. Results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for S. thermophilus in Italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat S. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the eps (Exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - We report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis. This report is the first genetic work concerning EPS production in a food microorganism. The EPS secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D- D-Galp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Galp-D-GalpNAc-(1-->. The genetic locus The genetic locus was identified by Tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify Eps mutants. Sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of Sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. EPS expression in the non-EPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsA to epsM was capable of directing EPS synthesis and secretion in this host. Homology searches of the predicted proteins in the Swiss-Prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsA, B, C, D, and E and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsB, D, F, and H and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus for epsC, D, and E and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide I (EPSI) synthesis in Rhizobium meliloti for epsC to epsJ and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps K and lipB of Neisseria meningitidis. Genes (epsJ, epsL, and epsM) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the Swiss-Prot database were shown to be involved in EPS synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. We associated the insertion sequence ISS1 with the thermosensitive replicon pG+ host to generate a mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. ISS1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus thermophilus. High-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in Lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. After ISS1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated ISS1 sequences flanking pG+ host. This structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. In addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single ISS1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. Mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.
TI  - Development of an expression strategy using a lytic phage to trigger explosive plasmid amplification and gene expression.
AB  - A novel plasmid-based expression strategy, exploiting two features of lytic bacteriophages, was developed in Lactococcus lactis. Components of this system include a phage origin of replication and phage expression signals, which were induced to high efficiency upon phage infection of the host. Phage-specific expression signals were cloned from phi 31 in a promoter-screening strategy using the lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus. One clone exhibited a significant induction in beta-galactosidase production and concomitant increase in lacZ mRNA during the phi 31 infection cycle of the host. Molecular characterization of the cloned insert revealed 888 bp positioned near the phi 31 cos site. Primer extension analysis showed that transcription was induced approximately 20 min following phi 31 infection at four points, apparently organized in two sets of tandem promoters on the cloned phage insert. One of these middle phage promoters also showed a basal level of activity prior to phage infection. The phi 31 promoter lacZ cassette was cloned into a low-copy-number vector plasmid containing the phi 31 origin of replication (ori31) and the resulting low-copy-number plasmid exhibited negligible beta-galactosidase production in L. lactis. However, > 2,000 units were detected following a deliberate infection with phi 31. A control expression plasmid without ori31 could only be induced to 85 units. The combination of these phage-inducible expression signals together with ori31 functioned synergistically to drive rapid and high efficiency expression of a heterologous gene in L. lactis.
TI  - Highly bioluminescent Streptococcus thermophilus strain for the detection of diary-relevant antibiotics in milk.
AB  - Inefficient translational initiation is often the cause of poor foreign gene expression in gram-positive organisms. The expression of bacterial luciferase (lux) genes in Streptococcus thermophilus (bioluminescence) was improved by addressing this problem in two ways; by ribosome-binding site (RBS) replacement, and by enhancing lux RBS access by polymerase chain reaction modification either alone or combined with translational coupling to a truncated upstream open- reading frame (orf') having its own RBS. Lactococcal expression signals were employed for plasmid-based lux expression. The same constructs were used to monitor bioluminescence in Lactococcus lactis, as well as two non-lactic bacterial strains, for comparison. High lux expression was achieved in all four organisms with a heterodimeric thermostable enzyme. Surprisingly, where ready access to the lux RBS was predicted, translational coupling to the lactococcal orf remained a prerequisite for detectable lux expression in L. lactis. In contrast, high bioluminescence in S. thermophilus was independent of coupling. Consistent with these observations, inspection of published gene sequences suggests that RBS "strength" may be a more important factor in translation in S. thermophilus than in L. lactis. Using reduced light production in highly bioluminescent S. thermophilus as an indicator of biocide presence in milk, test times could be significantly shortened compared with a commercial test utilizing the related non-bioluminescent strain. lux genes appear to be sensitive, exponential-phase reporters of gene activity in S. thermophilus, an organism with molecular biology and genetics that remain largely unstudied.
TI  - A system to generate chromosomal mutations in Lactococcus lactis which allows fast analysis of targeted genes.
AB  - A system for generating chromosomal insertions in lactococci is described. It is  based on the conditional replication of lactococcal pWV01-derived Ori+ RepA- vector pORI19, containing lacZ alpha and the multiple cloning site of pUC19. Chromosomal AluI fragments of Lactococcus lactis were cloned in pORI19 in RepA+ helper strain Escherichia coli EC101. The frequency of Campbell-type recombinants, following introduction of this plasmid bank into L. lactis (RepA-), was increased by combining the system with temperature-sensitive pWV01 derivative pVE6007. Transformation of L. lactis MG1363 (pVE6007) with the pORI19 bank of lactococcal chromosomal fragments at the permissive temperature allowed replication of several copies of a recombinant plasmid from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of RepA-Ts from pVE6007. A temperature shift to 37 degrees C resulted in loss of pVE6007 and integration of the pORI19 derivatives at high frequencies. A bank of lactococcal mutants was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two mutations: one in the monocistronic 1.3-kb peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (acmA) and one in the hitherto uncharacterized maltose fermentation pathway. Reintroduction of pVE6007 into the Mal- mutant at 30 degrees C resulted in excision of the integrated plasmid and restoration of the ability of ferment maltose. The integration plasmid (pMAL) was rescued by using the isolated plasmid content of a restored Mal+ colony to transform E. coli EC101. Nucleotide sequencing of the 564-bp chromosomal fragment in pMAL revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant homology with ATP-binding proteins MalK of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Enterobacter aerogenes and MsmK of Streptococcus mutans. This combined use of two types of conditional replicating pWV01-derived vectors represents a novel, powerful tool for chromosomal gene inactivation, targeting, cloning, and sequencing of the labelled gene.
TI  - 16S-23S and 23S-5S intergenic spacer regions of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus salivarius, primary and secondary structure.
AB  - The 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 1) of Streptococcus salivarius, S. thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region (spacer region 2) of S. salivarius and L. lactis subsp. cremoris were sequenced and compared with the spacer regions 1 and 2 of other streptococci. A high degree of intraspecific conservation was observed for S. thermophilus and L. lactis, and very similar sequences were found for S. salivarius and S. thermophilus. Whereas spacer region 1 is highly conserved in the genus Streptococcus sensu-stricto, only the tRNA gene and the rRNA processing stems are highly conserved in the three genera: Streptococcus sensu-stricto, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus. The presence of a unique tRNA(Ala) gene without the 3' terminal CCA sequence seems to be a general feature of the streptococci spacer region 1. A secondary structure model was built to show the interaction between the spacer regions 1 and 2 of S. thermophilus and S. salivarius. The rapid evolution of spacer region 1 in streptococci is in part due to insertions and deletions of small RNA stem/loop structures.
TI  - Cloning and Sequencing of LlaII Restriction/Modification Genes from Lactococcus lactis and Relatedness of This System to the Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII System.
AB  - Volume 61, no. 6, p. 2193-2202: the restriction/modification system designation "LlaII" should read "LlaDCHI" throughout the paper to conform to conventional nomenclature for such systems. [This corrects the article on p. 2193 in vol. 61.].
TI  - Streptococcus lactis septicemia in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lantibiotic Pep5 biosynthetic gene cluster and functional analysis of PepP and PepC. Evidence for a role of PepC in thioether formation.
AB  - The biosynthesis of Pep5, a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide, is directed by the 20-kbp plasmid pED503. We identified a 7.9-kbp DNA-fragment within this plasmid which covers the information for Pep5 synthesis in the homologous host Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 which has been cured of pED503. This fragment contained, in addition to the previously described structural gene pepA and the immunity gene pepI [Reis, M., Eschbach-Bludau, M., Iglesias-Wind, M. I., Kupke, T. & Sahl, H.-G. (1994) Appl. Env. Microbiol. 60, 2876-2883], a gene pepT coding for a translocator of the ABC transporter family, a gene pepP coding for a serine protease and two genes pepB and pepC coding for putative modification enzymes; the gene arrangement is pepTIAPBC. We analyzed the biosynthetic genes with respect to their function in Pep5 biosynthesis. Deletion of PepT reduced Pep5 production to about 10%, indicating that it can be partially replaced by other host-encoded translocators. Inactivation of PepP by site-directed mutagenesis of the active-site His residue resulted in production of incorrectly processed Pep5 fragments with strongly reduced antimicrobial activity. Deletion of pepB and pepC leads to accumulation of Pep5 prepeptide in the cells without excretion of processed peptide. A pepC-deletion clone did not excrete correctly matured Pep5 but it did produce fragments from which serine and threonine were absent. Only one of these fragments contained a single lanthionine residue out of three expected while the remaining, unmodified cysteine residues could be detected by reaction with Ellman's reagent. These results demonstrate that PepC is a thioether-forming protein and strongly suggest that PepB is responsible for dehydration of serine and threonine.
TI  - Construction of a Streptococcus pyogenes recA mutant via insertional inactivation, and cloning and sequencing of the complete recA gene.
AB  - To facilitate future genetic studies with Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp), a recA mutant (Rec11) was constructed using a streptococcal integration vector carrying a PCR-derived internal recA fragment. The insertion of the plasmid in the mutant chromosome was identified by Southern hybridization. Resistance to UV and the ability to accept linear DNA transformation by Rec11 were greatly decreased, confirming its RecA phenotype. Using the PCR-derived fragment as a probe, we cloned and sequenced the complete Sp recA gene, which is highly homologous to the recA of S. pneumoniae and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the tetL gene and identification  of iso-ISS1 elements from Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1.
AB  - The tetracycline-resistance (TcR) determinant of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1 has been identified and located on a 2.2-kb RsaI-EcoRI fragment. The fragment was cloned in Escherichia coli, and specified TcR in this host. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1374 bp, designated tetL. The nt sequence of tetL from pJH1 was identical to that of the tetL present on pLS1 from Streptococcus agalactiae. Upstream of the pJH1 tetL, part of another ORF was found that, except for two single-nt substitutions, was identical to an iso-ISS1 element from Lactococcus lactis. Hybridization studies indicated the presence of several ISS1-like elements in plasmid pJH1, but not on the En. faecalis chromosome. To study its usefulness as a marker in Gram+ organisms, the pJH1 tetL was cloned on the broad-host-range plasmid pNZ124, resulting in pNZ280, that was found to give resistance to 40 micrograms Tc/ml in Lc. lactis and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Expression of a Lactococcus lactis Phage Resistance Mechanism by Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - The 7.8-kb lactococcal plasmid pSRQ700 encodes the LlaII restriction/modification system which recognizes and cleaves the sequence 3(prm1)-GATC-5(prm1). When the plasmid pSRQ700 is introduced into a phage-sensitive Lactococcus lactis strain, strong phage resistance is conferred by the LlaII system. In this report, we show that pSRQ700 cannot replicate in Streptococcus thermophilus. However, if cloned into the vector pNZ123, the native LlaII system is expressed and strong phage resistance is conferred to various industrial S. thermophilus strains. Resistance against phages isolated from yogurt and mozzarella wheys was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of increased phage resistance in S. thermophilus.
TI  - The formation of biogenic amines by fermentation organisms.
AB  - A total of 523 strains representing 35 species related to food fermentation organisms of practical importance were investigated for their potential for formation of biogenic amines (BA). The investigation was performed with resting cells in phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) and the formation of the following BAs was followed: putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine. No potential was observed in species of lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and several Lactobacillus spp., such as L. Pentosus and L. sake. A remarkable potential to form BA was observed in strains of carnobacteria, Lactobacillus buchneri, L. curvatus, L. reuteri, Staphylococcus carnosus and, to a lesser extent, in L. alimentarius, L. brevis, L. bavaricus, L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Micrococcus spp. and S. piscifermentans. In well known species with a practical function in the fermentation of dairy products, wine or cabbage a potential was observed for few strains only. In view of their role as starters in food fermentation, or their potential use in protective cultures and as probiotics, BA formation by the organisms has to be taken into consideration by selecting appropriate strains.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of LlaDCHI [corrected] restriction/modification genes from Lactococcus lactis and relatedness of this system to the Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII system.
AB  - The natural 7.8-kb plasmid pSRQ700 was isolated from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris DCH-4. It encodes a restriction/modification system named LlaDCHI [corrected]. When introduced into a phage-sensitive L. lactis strain, pSRQ700 confers strong phage resistance against the three most common lactococcal phage species, namely, 936, c2, and P335. The LlaDCHI [corrected] endonuclease was purified and found to cleave the palindromic sequence 5'-GATC-3'. It is an isoschizomer of Streptococcus pneumoniae DpnII. The plasmid pSRQ700 was mapped, and the genetic organization of LlaDCHI [corrected] was localized. Cloning and sequencing of the entire LlaDCHI [corrected] system allowed the identification of three open reading frames. The three genes (llaIIA, llaIIB, and llaIIC) overlapped and are under one putative promoter. A putative terminator was found at the end of llaIIC. The genes llaIIA and llaIIB coded for m6A methyltransferases, and llaIIC coded for an endonuclease. The LlaDCHI [corrected] system shares strong genetic similarities with the DpnII system. The deduced amino acid sequence of M.LlaIIA was 75% identical with that of M.DpnII, whereas M.LlaIIB was 88% identical with M.DpnA. However, R.LlalII shared only 31% identity with R.DpnII.
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - [Data on the cultural and morphologic features of dissociation forms of nisin-producing Streptococcus].
AB  - Colonies and cells of S and G variants of Streptococcus lactis, strain MSU were studied comparatively. It was shown that in the G form the growth rate and other biosynthetic peculiarities and in particular the capacity for the nisin synthesis were lower. Morphological properties of the colonies and cells of the S and G variants of the nisin-producing streptococcus were investigated.
TI  - Characterization and distribution of two insertion sequences, IS1191 and iso-IS981, in Streptococcus thermophilus: does intergeneric transfer of insertion sequences occur in lactic acid bacteria co-cultures?
AB  - A chromosomal repeated sequence from Streptococcus thermophilus was identified as a new insertion sequence (IS), IS1191. This is the first IS element characterized in this species. This 1313 bp element has 28 bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats and is flanked by short direct repeats of 8 bp. The single large open reading frame of IS1191 encodes a 391-amino-acid protein which displays homologies with transposases encodes by IS1201 from Lactobacillus helveticus (44.5% amino-acid sequence identity) and by the other ISs of the IS256 family. One of the copies of IS1191 is inserted into a truncated iso-IS981 element. The nucleotide sequences of two truncated iso-IS981s from S. thermophilus and the sequence of IS981 element from Lactococcus lactis share more than 99% identity. The distribution of these insertion sequences in L. lactis and S. thermophilus strains suggests that intergeneric transfers occur during cocultures used in the manufacture of cheese.
TI  - Specific antibody-mediated detection of Brochothrix thermosphacta in situ in British fresh sausage.
AB  - A rabbit polyclonal antibody-linked probe was developed which detected 76% of 800 food isolates of the spoilage bacterium Brochothrix thermosphacta when cells were bound to nitrocellulose. In slide cross-reaction tests all six environmental isolates tested were stained but the type strain was not. The antibody did not cross-react with Listeria grayi, L. monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus or B. subtilis. The antibody-linked probe detected Br. thermosphacta in thin sections of British fresh sausage when the viable count was greater than 10(6) g-1. Cells were detected mainly within 1 or 2 mm of the surface on the loose starchy material. They were not detected within muscle blocks or in the centre of the sausage. Such results suggest that growth of this organism occurs close to the surface of the sausage.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of hydrogen peroxide and copper or iron-containing complex ions in relation to leukocyte function.
AB  - Various combinations of hydrogen peroxide, reductant (ascorbic acid and superoxide ion), and copper or iron salts and their coordination complexes were examined to determine their cytotoxicity toward several bacteria with diverse metabolic capabilities and cell envelope structures. Four sets of bactericidal conditions were identified, comprising: (1) high concentration levels (5-100 mM) of H2O2 in the absence of exogenous metal ions and reductant; (2) ferrous or ferric coordination complexes plus enzymatically generated O2.- and H2O2 at relatively low steady-state concentration levels; (3) cupric ion plus low concentration levels of H2O2 (1 microM-1 mM) and ascorbate (10 microM-4 mM); (4) cuprous ion (or cupric ion plus ascorbate) in the absence of O2 and H2O2. Rates of losses in viabilities increased proportionately with increases in the concentration of H2O2 in metal-free environments and with each of the components in the Cu2+/ascorbate/H2O2 bactericidal assay system. Oxidant levels required for equivalent killing increased with increasing cell densities of the bacterial suspensions over the range investigated (2 x 10(7)-2 x 10(9) cfu/ml). Other experimental conditions or other combinations of reagents, most notably Fe3+/ascorbate/H2O2 systems, did not generate bactericidal environments. The patterns of response of the three organisms tested, Streptococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were similar, suggesting common bactericidal mechanisms. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the lethal lesions caused by the various bactericidal conditions are distinct: As discussed, each of the four bactericidal conditions could conceivably be attained within the phagosomes of leukocytes, although none has as yet been identified.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.
AB  - A gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified in a genomic library of the strain in pUC19 by screening Escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity on a medium containing autoclaved, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells. In cell extracts of L. lactis MG1363 and several halo-producing E. coli transformants, lytic bands of similar sizes were identified by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels containing L. lactis or M. lysodeikticus cell walls. Of these clearing bands, corresponding to the presence of lytic enzymes with sizes of 46 and 41 kDa, the 41-kDa band was also present in the supernatant of an L. lactis culture. Deletion analysis of one of the recombinant plasmids showed that the information specifying lytic activity was contained within a 2,428-bp EcoRV-Sau3A fragment. Sequencing of part of this fragment revealed a gene (acmA) that could encode a polypeptide of 437 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular mass of AcmA (46,564 Da) corresponded to that of one of the lytic activities detected. Presumably, the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor protein which is processed by cleavage after the Ala at position 57, thus producing a mature protein with a size of 40,264 Da, which would correspond to the size of the enzyme whose lytic activity was present in culture supernatants of L. lactis. The N-terminal region of the mature protein showed 60% identity with the N-terminal region of the mature muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae and the autolysin of Streptococcus faecalis. Like the latter two enzymes, AcmA contains C-terminal repeated regions. In AcmA, these three repeats are separated by nonhomologous intervening sequences highly enriched in serine, threonine, and asparagine. Genes specifying identical activities were detected in various strains of L. lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detection assay and PCR experiments. By replacement recombination, an acmA deletion mutant which grew as long chains was constructed, indicating that AcmA is required for cell separation.
TI  - Primary structure and functional analysis of the lysis genes of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh.
AB  - The lysis genes of the Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh were isolated  by complementation of a lambda Sam mutation in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequencing of a 1,735-bp DNA fragment revealed two adjacent coding regions of 342 bp (hol) and 951 bp (lys) in the same reading frame which appear to belong to a common transcriptional unit. Proteins corresponding to the predicted gene products, holin (12.9 kDa) and lysin (34.7 kDa), were identified by in vitro and in vivo expression of the cloned genes. The phi adh holin is a membrane-bound protein with structural similarity to lysis proteins of other phage, known to be required for the transit of murein hydrolases through the cytoplasmic membrane. The phi adh lysin shows homology with mureinolytic enzymes encoded by the Lactobacillus bulgaricus phage mv4, the Streptococcus pneumoniae phage Cp-1, Cp-7, and Cp-9, and the Lactococcus lactis phage phi LC3. Significant homology with the N termini of known muramidases suggests that phi adh lysin acts by a similar catalytic mechanism. In E. coli, the phi adh lysin seems to be associated with the total membrane fraction, from which it can be extracted with lauryl sarcosinate. Either one of the phi adh lysis proteins provoked lysis of E. coli when expressed along with holins or lysins of phage lambda or Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29. Concomitant expression of the combined holin and lysin functions of phi adh in E. coli, however, did not result in efficient cell lysis.
TI  - High expression of a foreign reporter gene in Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The pFL10 plasmid vector for translational fusions was constructed. pFL10 is based in the promiscuous pLS1 replicon and contains the pC194 cat gene deprived of its transcriptional promoter and Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. Three promoters (Pcit, PpolA and PtetL) from Gram-positive bacteria, inserted in pFL10, were tested for their ability to drive transcription in Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These promoters were coupled to the SD sequence of the lactococcal citP gene fused to the cat gene. Determination of the 5' ends of the three mRNAs by primer extension revealed the same start sites in both bacterial systems. However, it was observed a differential efficiency of promoter utilization by the RNA polymerases from the two hosts. The transcriptional behavior correlates with expression of the cat gene measured by determinations of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. Substitution of the SD of citP by that of the T7 phi 10 gene rendered a similar decrease of the CAT production in both bacterial systems.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) from Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302.
AB  - A general aminopeptidase (St-PepN) was purified from an intracellular extract of  Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CNRZ 302 by ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in denaturing or nondenaturating conditions showed a single protein band. The enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 97 kDa. Its activity is maximal at pH 7 and 36 degrees C and is completely abolished by CuCl2 and ZnCl2. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by metal-chelating reagents, such as EDTA and o-phenanthroline, which suggests that St-PepN is a metalloenzyme. The enzyme showed activity toward p-nitroanilide derivatives or dipeptides and tripeptides and showed a preference for hydrophobic or basic amino acids at the N-terminal position. Longer peptide chains, such as the B-chain of insulin, glucagon, or peptides generated by the hydrolysis of caseins, were degraded, too. The sequence of the first 21 residues of the mature enzyme was determined and showed high homology with that of the aminopeptidase PepN isolated from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2. The properties of the enzyme are compared with those of corresponding enzymes of other species of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Heterogeneric conjugal transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 (IncHlyI) of Enterococcus faecalis in the apparent absence of pheromone induction.
AB  - Erythromycin-resistant derivatives of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 from Enterococcus faecalis were constructed to study its host range. This was done by inserting the integrative vector pAT112 and the related replicon pTCR1 harboring oriR of the broad host range plasmid pAM beta 1 into the hemolysin-bacteriocin operon of pIP964, to give pTCR2 and pTCR3, respectively. Plasmid pTCR2 was transferred by filter matings from E. faecalis to Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes at frequencies of 2 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) per donor, respectively, in the apparent absence of pheromone induction and cellular aggregation. In these hosts, pTCR2 remained intact as a self-replicating element and maintained its transfer capabilities. Plasmid pTCR3, but not pTCR2, was transferred at similar frequencies from E. faecalis to Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus agalactiae. Thus, the transfer system of pIP964 possesses a broader host-range than its replication system.
TI  - Aminopeptidase N from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573: purification and properties.
AB  - A 96 kDa aminopeptidase was purified from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus NCDO 573. The enzyme had similar properties to aminopeptidases isolated from lactococci and lactobacilli and showed a high degree of N-terminal amino acid sequence homology to aminopeptidase N from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. It catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides. In common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. Relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. The aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with L-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. The enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the N-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the N-terminal side of a proline residue.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and structural organization of the small, broad-host-range plasmid pCI411 from Leuconostoc lactis 533.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Leuconostoc lactis 533 cryptic plasmid pCI411 (2926 bp) was determined. Analysis revealed the presence of three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 was capable of encoding a 24.9 kDa peptide which shared homology with the replication initiation protein (RepB) from a number of Gram-positive rolling circle plasmids. ORF 2 could encode a peptide of 6.6 kDa which was homologous to the RepC protein of the lactococcal plasmid pWV01. A function could not be assigned to ORF 3, which was capable of encoding a 12.1 kDa peptide. Transcription-translation analysis indicated the presence of three peptides of the predicted molecular masses. A putative double strand origin of replication (DSO) was identified which showed strong similarity with the DSO of a number of Gram-positive plasmids including pE194 from Staphylococcus. Structural analysis identified a number of direct and indirect repeats in addition to putative recombination-specific sites (RSA and RSB) in the non-coding region of pCI411. The observed characteristics suggest that this plasmid replicates using the rolling circle mechanism. pCI411, which could be introduced into Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Bacillus is the first plasmid from the genus Leuconostoc to be characterized in such detail.
TI  - Gene cloning and characterization of PepC, a cysteine aminopeptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus, with sequence similarity to the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase.
AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ 302 contains at least three general aminopeptidases able to hydrolyze Phe-beta-naphthylamide substrate. The gene encoding one of these aminopeptidases was cloned from a total DNA library of S. thermophilus CNRZ 302 constructed in Escherichia coli TG1 using pBluescript plasmid. The wild-type TG1 strain, although not deficient in aminopeptidase activity, is unable to hydrolyze the substrate Phe-beta-naphthylamide, and thus the library could be screened with an enzymic plate assay using this substrate. One clone was selected which was shown to express an aminopeptidase, identified as a PepC-like enzyme on the basis of cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies directed against the lactococcal PepC cysteine aminopeptidase. The gene was further subcloned and sequenced. A complete open reading frame coding for a 445-residue (50414 Da) polypeptide was identified. 70% identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence and the sequence of PepC from Lactococcus lactis subspecies cremoris, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. High sequence similarity (38% identity) was also found with an eucaryotic enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase. In addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of the streptococcal PepC showed a region of strong similarity to the active site of cysteine proteinases with conservation of the residues involved in the catalytic site. The product of the cloned pepC gene was overproduced in E. coli and was purified from a cellular extract. Purification to homogeneity was achieved by two-step ion-exchange chromatography. Biochemical characterization of the pure recombinant enzyme confirms that the cloned peptidase is a thiol aminopeptidase possessing a broad specificity. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 300 kDa suggesting an hexameric structure. On the basis of sequence similarities as well as common biochemical and enzymic properties, the bacterial PepC-type enzymes and the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase constitute a new family of thiol aminopeptidases among the cysteine peptidases.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - Direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  - A system for direct screening of recombinant clones in Lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in the organism, was developed. The nuc gene (encoding SNase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. L. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete SNase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. A multicloning site (MCS) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature SNase, without affecting nuclease activity. Cloning foreign DNA fragments into any site of the MCS interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. The utility of this system for L. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA fragments into the MCS of the nucMCS cassette. Both cloning vectors containing the nucMCS cassette were also introduced into Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. The potential uses of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.
TI  - Cloning, molecular characterization, and expression of the genes encoding the lytic functions of lactococcal bacteriophage phi LC3: a dual lysis system of modular design.
AB  - The genes encoding the lysis proteins of Lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi LC3 were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The phi LC3 lysis genes, lysA and lysB, encode a membrane-disrupting protein (LysA) of 88 amino acids, and a cell wall degrading protein (LysB) of 429 amino acids, which shares significant sequence similarity with lysins from the Streptococcus pneumoniae phages Cp-1, Cp-7, and Cp-9, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii phage mv1. Both LysA and LysB function in E. coli, as judged by lysis of the E. coli host cells and by lytic activity against lactococcal cells when the cloned lysA and lysB genes are expressed. The LysA protein possesses two putative transmembrane helices and highly charged N- and C-termini, and is structurally similar to phage holins that are known to induce lesions in the inner membrane through which phage endolysin can be released to its cell wall substrate. The C-terminal end of LysB contains two highly homologous sequence repeats of 43 amino acids. The LysB repeats show strong sequence similarity to repeats found in lytic enzymes from other Gram-positive bacteria and from Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 and PZA, as well as in some functionally unrelated proteins, and they are possibly involved in binding of the enzyme to the cell wall substrate. The organization of the dual phi LC3 lysis system supports earlier suggestions that exchange of modular units is an important principle in protein evolution.
TI  - Molecular characterization of lactococcal bacteriophage Tuc2009 and identification and analysis of genes encoding lysin, a putative holin, and two structural proteins.
AB  - Bacteriophage Tuc2009 is a temperate bacteriophage with a small isometric head and is isolated from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris UC509. The phage genome is packaged by a headful mechanism, giving rise to circularly permuted molecules with terminal redundancy. The unit genome size is approximately 39 kb. A map of the phage genome on which several determinants could be localized was constructed: pac, the site of initiation of DNA packaging; lys (1,287 bp), specifying the phage lysin; S (267 bp), specifying a putative holin; and mp1 (522 bp) and mp2 (498 bp), each specifying one of the phage's structural proteins. lys, S, mp1, and mp2 were further characterized. lys and S are partially overlapping and appear to be part of one operon. The lysin shows homology to the lysins of the Streptococcus pneumoniae phages Cp-9, Cp-1, and Cp-7. The putative holin, which is thought to be involved in the release of lysin from the cytoplasm, contains two strongly hydrophobic presumptive transmembrane domains and a highly charged C-terminal domain.
TI  - The Lactococcus lactis sex-factor aggregation gene cluA.
AB  - A gene, cluA, was cloned from the chromosomally located sex factor of Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Sequence analysis revealed significant homology with previously described aggregation proteins in Enterococcus and Streptococcus species. The possibility that cluA was an equivalent protein involved in cell aggregation between donor and recipient bacteria during lactococcal conjugation was confirmed by its expression under the control of a heterologous promoter in L. lactis. Analysis of the homology between the CluA protein and the related proteins of Enterococcus and Streptococcus allowed a common structure for these proteins to be postulated. This consisted of five domains. Functionally conserved domains I and V act respectively as a secretory leader and C-terminal membrane anchor. Domains II and IV are conserved at the amino acid level and probably have common structural roles whereas domain III is variable and may control binding specificity.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 pepC gene.
AB  - Sequence analysis of the aminopeptidase C gene (pepC) from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 identified a 1,332-nucleotide open reading frame coding for a polypeptide with motifs characteristic of cysteine proteinases. Homology to the pepC gene appears to be widely distributed among lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Growth phase-dependent regulation and membrane localization of SpaB, a protein involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin.
AB  - The information responsible for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin is organized in an operon-like structure that starts with the spaB gene. The spaB gene encodes an open reading frame consisting of 1,030 amino acid residues, and it was calculated that a protein having a theoretical molecular mass of 120.5 kDa could be produced from this gene. This is consistent with the apparent molecular weight for SpaB of 115,000 which was estimated after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and identification with SpaB-specific antibodies. The SpaB protein is very similar to proteins EpiB and NisB, which were identified previously as being involved in epidermin and nisin biosynthesis. Upstream from SpaB a characteristic sigma A promoter sequence was identified. An immunoblot analysis revealed that SpaB expression was strongly regulated. No SpaB protein was detected in the early logarithmic growth phase, and maximum SpaB expression was observed in the early stationary growth phase. The expression of SpaB was strongly correlated with subtilin biosynthesis. Deletion mutations in either of two recently identified regulatory genes, spaR and spaK, which act as a "two-component" regulatory system necessary for growth phase-dependent induction of subtilin biosynthesis (C. Klein, C. Kaletta, and K. D. Entian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59:296-303, 1993), also resulted in failure of SpaB expression. To investigate the intracellular localization of SpaB, vesicles of Bacillus subtilis were prepared. The SpaB protein cosedimented with the vesicle fraction and was released only after vigorous resuspension of the vesicles. Our results suggest that SpaB is membrane associated and that subtilin biosynthesis occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane of B. subtilis.
TI  - LlaAI and LlaBI, two type-II restriction endonucleases from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W9 and W56 recognizing, respectively, 5'-/GATC-3' and 5'-C/TRYAG-3'.
AB  - Two type-II restriction endonucleases have been purified from Lactococcus lactis  subsp. cremoris W9 and W56, the strains isolated from a mixed Cheddar starter. Their characterization showed that LlaAI was an isoschizomer of MboI from Morexella bovis with the cleaving sequence, 5'/GATC-3', being sensitive to methylation of the adenine residue; LlaBI was an isoschizomer to SfcI from Streptococcus faceium with the cleaving sequence, 5'-C/TRYAG-3'. Both LlaAI and LlaBI restriction-modification (R-M) systems are encoded by the plasmids, respectively, pFW094 and pJW563, protecting the harboring strain against phage attack.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans lactose-specific enzyme II (lacE) gene of the PTS and the phospho-beta-galactosidase (lacG) gene.
AB  - The lacE and lacG genes from Streptococcus mutans have been isolated and characterized, and their nucleotide sequence has been determined. The lacE gene encodes the lactose-specific Enzyme II component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The lacG gene encodes the phospho-beta-galactosidase which cleaves the lactose phosphate that is formed by the lactose PTS. The S. mutans lacE and lacG genes are located in the same operon as the tagatose genes. S. mutans metabolizes lactose via the tagatose phosphate pathway. The deduced LacE and LacG proteins of S. mutans display high homology with the corresponding proteins from Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Partial characterization of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  - With degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal DNA fragment of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sequence of this PCR product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "RpoD box" of primary sigma factors. This PCR product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - [The development of a nutrient medium for nisin-producing streptococci utilizing  the waste products from a number of biotechnology plants].
AB  - The possibility of using some waste products of the dairy and agricultural industries as nutrient substrates for the cultivation of nisin-producing streptococci was studied. Yeast production wastes as well as potato liquor, whey and dried whey as waste products were shown suitable for the growth of Streptococcus lactis and the biosynthesis of nisin. The level of the nisin production increased when corn steep liquor and glucose were added to whey and dried whey respectively.
TI  - Energy transduction in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In the discovery of some general principles of energy transduction, lactic acid bacteria have played an important role. In this review, the energy transducing processes of lactic acid bacteria are discussed with the emphasis on the major developments of the past 5 years. This work not only includes the biochemistry of the enzymes and the bioenergetics of the processes, but also the genetics of the genes encoding the energy transducing proteins. The progress in the area of carbohydrate transport and metabolism is presented first. Sugar translocation involving ATP-driven transport, ion-linked cotransport, heterologous exchange and group translocation are discussed. The coupling of precursor uptake to product product excretion and the linkage of antiport mechanisms to the deiminase pathways of lactic acid bacteria is dealt with in the second section. The third topic relates to metabolic energy conservation by chemiosmotic processes. There is increasing evidence that precursor/product exchange in combination with precursor decarboxylation allows bacteria to generate additional metabolic energy. In the final section transport of nutrients and ions as well as mechanisms to excrete undesirable (toxic) compounds from the cells are discussed.
TI  - Presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. We isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. Samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. Enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus hirae, and Enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other. These bacteria were found in a variety of samples. Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. On the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as E. casseliflavus. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. Nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile groups which could not be identified with the aid of known Aerococcus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, or Streptococcus strains. The maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.
TI  - Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacR, lacABCD, and lacFE genes encoding the repressor, tagatose 6-phosphate gene cluster, and sugar-specific phosphotransferase system components of the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of lacRABCDF and partial nucleotide sequence of lacE from the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans are presented. Comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. The deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of Lactobacillus casei. Additionally, LacR has sequence homology with the repressor (DeoR) of the Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while LacC is similar to phosphokinases (FruK and PfkB) from E. coli. The primary translation products of the lacRABCDFE genes are polypeptides of 251 (M(r) 28,713), 142 (M(r) 15,610), 171 (M(r) 18,950), 310 (M(r) 33,368), 325 (M(r) 36,495), 104 (M(r) 11,401), and 123 (NH2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. As inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (LacR), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (LacA and LacB), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (LacC), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (LacD), and the sugar-specific components enzyme III-lactose (LacF) and enzyme II-lactose (LacE) of the S. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The nucleotide sequence encompassing the S. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of S. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans serotype c tagatose 6-phosphate pathway gene cluster.
AB  - DNA cloned into Escherichia coli K-12 from a serotype c strain of Streptococcus mutans encodes three enzyme activities for galactose utilization via the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway: galactose 6-phosphate isomerase, tagatose 6-phosphate kinase, and tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. The genes coding for the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway were located on a 3.28-kb HindIII DNA fragment. Analysis of the tagatose proteins expressed by recombinant plasmids in minicells was used to determine the sizes of the various gene products. Mutagenesis of these plasmids with transposon Tn5 was used to determine the order of the tagatose genes. Tagatose 6-phosphate isomerase appears to be composed of 14- and 19-kDa subunits. The sizes of the kinase and aldolase were found to be 34 and 36 kDa, respectively. These values correspond to those reported previously for the tagatose pathway enzymes in Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Genetic analysis of scrA and scrB from Streptococcus sobrinus 6715.
AB  - A DNA fragment containing scrA and scrB, which encode enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, respectively, was isolated from a lambda gt10 genomic DNA library of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715. Both genes were located on a 4.2-kb DNA fragment which was maintained stably in Escherchia coli on low-copy-number vector pGB2. The recombinant E. coli clone expressed sucrose-hydrolytic activity on MacConkey agar base supplemented with raffinose or sucrose. Results from deletion analysis showed that the sucrose-metabolic activity was contained within a 3.5-kb region. The lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LM0230, which is devoid of sucrose-metabolic activity, was used to study the enzyme activities encoded by scrA and scrB from S. sobrinus 6715. L. lactis transformants carrying the 4.2-kb S. sobrinus-derived DNA fragment on E. coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector pDL278 were able to grow at the expense of sucrose and exhibited enzyme II and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase activities. Results from hybridization studies and a comparison of the restriction endonuclease maps of the scrA- and scrB-containing chromosomal regions from S. mutans GS5 and S. sobrinus 6715 suggested considerable divergence.
TI  - Location, characterization and expression of lytic enzyme-encoding gene, lytA, of Lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi US3.
AB  - Gene lytA, which encodes lytic enzyme (LytA), of the isometric Lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi US3, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The lytA gene was located on the physical map of the phi US3 32-kb DNA that contains cohesive ends. Initial expression of lytA was detected by lysis of an overlay of cells of the phage-sensitive strain, L. lactis SK112. However, LytA appeared to have a broad spectrum and induced lysis in more than 30 different lactococcal strains. The nucleotide sequence of lytA showed a single open reading frame (ORF) of 774 bp encoding a protein of 258 amino acids (aa) with a calculated M(r) of 28,977. This is in agreement with the size of 29 kDa as determined for LytA produced in E. coli using a T7 expression system. The lytA gene is preceded by an ORF that may code for a hydrophobic peptide of 66 aa containing a putative secretion signal, and two putative transmembrane helices. The deduced aa sequence of the phage phi US3 LytA shows similarities to that of the autolysin of Streptococcus pneumoniae which is known to be an amidase.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in  fermented dairy products.
AB  - Lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar has been developed for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products. The medium contains lithium chloride and sodium propionate to inhibit the growth of other lactic acid bacteria. Pure cultures of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci were tested for growth in this medium. With one exception, all bifidobacteria were able to grow in this medium and in a nonselective agar with a difference not exceeding .4 log units. However, none of the lactobacilli tested and only one strain each of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris grew in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar. In those cases, the numbers of colonies were lower in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar by 1.26 and 2.51 log units, respectively, compared with a nonselective agar. Bifidobacteria were also selectively isolated from all fermented milks and cheeses analyzed.
TI  - Genus- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes derived from 16S rRNA for the  identification of vagococci.
AB  - Synthetic oligonucleotide probes specific for vagococci were designed from 16S rRNA sequence data. Molecular hybridizations with PCR-amplified rDNA targets provided an unequivocal means of differentiating vagococci from related lactic acid bacteria (eg. Carnobacterium, Enterococcus, Lactococcus) and identification at the generic and species levels.
TI  - [The effect of physicochemical environmental factors on the growth of gram-positive bacterial dissociants].
AB  - The growth of R-, S- and M (g)-dissociants of Streptococcus lactis, Bacillus coagulans, Rhodococcus rubropertinctus under the action of some physico-chemical factors: temperature, pH, ultraviolet (UV) rays, high concentration of NaCl and storage have been compared. R-variants gain selective advantage under the influence of UV-irradiation, high temperature and storage; S-variants--at decreasing of active pH of medium; M (g)-variants--at decreasing of growth temperature, high values of pH, increased NaCl concentration. The dissociation has been concluded to enlarge the limits of the species survival.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an endopeptidase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2.
AB  - An endopeptidase has been purified to homogeneity from a crude cell extract of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 by a procedure that includes diethyl-aminoethane-Sephacel chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography over an anion-exchange column and a hydrophobic-interaction column. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 70,000 Da. The endopeptidase can degrade several oligopeptides into various tetra-, tri-, and dipeptides. The endopeptidase has no aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, or tripeptidase activity. It is optimally active at pH 6.0 to 6.5 and in the temperature range of 30 to 38 degrees C. The enzyme is inactivated by the chemical agents 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate, beta-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and is inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+. The ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate- or 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme can be reactivated by Co2+. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies raised against the purified endopeptidase indicated that the enzyme is also present in other Lactococcus spp., as well as in Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
TI  - A host factor absent from Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis MG1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  - In matings between Lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons Tn916  and Tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. In agreement with this, the frequency of L. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant Tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. However, in intergeneric crosses with Bacillus subtilis or Enterococcus faecalis donors, Tn916 and Tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the L. lactis transconjugants. Moreover, Tn916 and Tn919 could not be transferred by conjugation from L. lactis and B. subtilis, E. faecalis or Streptococcus pyogenes. This suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in L. lactis. When cloned into E. coli with adjacent chromosomal DNA from L. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. Therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in L. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. We conclude that L. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.
TI  - [The use of plasmid profiles for the identification of Streptococcus lactis strains].
AB  - In this study, the plasmid contents of Streptococcus lactis strains, isolated from whey of white pickled cheese samples which produced using without industrial starter culture, were searched. It is determined that strains containing plasmids at a range of 1-10 with the molecular weight between 1.8 and 41 kilobases (Kb). Six of totally 28 Streptococcus lactis strains were classified into three groups according to their identical plasmid contents, and the others were identified as different strains.
TI  - Isolation, sequence and expression in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis of the DNase (streptodornase)-encoding gene from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A.
AB  - A partial library of BclI-generated chromosomal DNA fragments from Streptococcus  equisimilis H64A (Lancefield Group C) was constructed in Escherichia coli. Clones displaying either streptokinase or deoxyribonuclease (streptodornase; SDC) activities were isolated. The gene (sdc) expressing the SDC activity was allocated on the 1.1-kb AccI DNA subfragment. Sequence analysis of this DNA fragment revealed the presence of one open reading frame, which could encode a protein of 36.8 kDa. The N-terminal portion of the deduced protein exhibited features characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. The sdc gene was expressed in E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis. As observed for S. equisimilis, in the heterologous Gram + hosts, at least part of the SDC protein was secreted into the medium.
TI  - Transposon-encoded sucrose metabolism in Lactococcus lactis. Purification of sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase and genetic linkage to N5-(L-1-carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine synthase in strain K1.
AB  - Sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis K1-23 (formerly Streptococcus lactis K1-23) has been purified 600-fold to electrophoretic homogeneity. Purification of the enzyme was achieved by DEAE-Sephacel, phosphocellulose P-11, and gel exclusion (Ultrogel AcA 54) chromatography. The purified enzyme (specific activity 31 units/mg) catalyzed the hydrolysis of both 6-O-phosphoryl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-1,2-beta-D-fructofuranoside (sucrose 6-phosphate) and sucrose (Km = 0.1 and 100 mM, respectively). Ultracentrifugal analysis of sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase indicated an Mr = 52,200. The purified enzyme migrated as a single protein during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 52,000). However, four distinct polypeptides were detected by analytical electrofocusing, and all four species hydrolyzed sucrose and sucrose 6-phosphate. The amino acid composition of sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, and the sequence of the first 12 amino acids from the NH2 terminus, have been determined. Hybridization studies with oligonucleotide probes show that the genes for sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase (scrB), Enzyme IIScr of the phosphoenolypyruvate-dependent sucrose:phosphotransferase system (scrA), and N5-(carboxyethyl)ornithine synthase (ceo) are encoded by the same approximately 20-kilobase EcoRI fragment. This fragment is part of a large transposon Tn5306 that also encodes the nisin precursor gene, spaN, and IS904. In L. lactis ATCC 11454, spaN, IS904, scrA, and scrB (but not ceo) are encoded on a related transposon, Tn5307.
TI  - Ultrasound treatment for harvesting an aminopeptidase from lactic Acid bacteria and quantitation of the enzyme by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
AB  - Ultrasound treatment of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris AM2 was optimized to release a maximum amount of intracellular aminopeptidase without modifying the antigenicity of the enzyme. The cells were sonicated three times for 30 s at 23 W. Antibodies produced against the aminopeptidase purified from L. lactis subsp. cremoris AM2 enabled us to use immunoblotting to detect the enzyme in the lysates of all of the lactococci tested but not in the lysates of Leuconostoc strains, lactobacilli, and Streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to quantify the purified aminopeptidase; the detection limit was 4 ng/ml. The aminopeptidase in the supernatant obtained after the ultrasound treatment of strain AM2 cells was detected with the ELISA starting with a total protein concentration of 200 ng/ml. The proportion of equivalent purified aminopeptidase in the supernatant of L. lactis subsp. cremoris AM2 was about 2% of the total protein. Similarly, the aminopeptidase was quantified in different lactococci; the percentages varied between 0.16 and 2%, depending on the strain. The aminopeptidase content in a mixture of several lactic bacteria was also determined with the sandwich ELISA.
TI  - Distribution and purification of aspartate racemase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as Streptococcus species and Lactobacillus species. The enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 was more thermostable than that from Streptococcus lactis IAM1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. We purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of S. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. The enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees C and around pH 8.0. The sequence of the NH2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be Met-Glu-Asn-Phe-Phe-Ser-Ile-Leu-Gly-XXX-Met-Gly-Thr-Met-Ala-Thr-Glu-Ser- Phe-.
TI  - Binding of mutagens by fractions of the cell wall skeleton of lactic acid bacteria on mutagens.
AB  - The binding effect of cells and cell fractions, cell wall skeleton, cytoplasm, whole cells, and cell wall skeleton treated by lysozyme and alpha-amylase at 37 degrees C for 5 h, on Trp-P-1 (3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-[5H]pyrido [4,3-b]indole) and Trp-P-2 (3-amino-1-methyl-[5H]-pyrido[4,3-b]indole) were investigated. The cell and cell wall skeleton of Streptococcus cremoris Z-25 had greater binding activity, but cytoplasm and extract of cell wall skeleton did not bind Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2. When the cells or cell wall skeleton were treated with lysozyme and alpha-amylase, unbound Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 concentrations were greater than that of the untreated control. It is possible that cell walls may be involved in the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates to lactic acid bacteria. The cell wall skeleton of S. cremoris Z-25, Lactobacillus acidophilus IFO 13951, and Bifidobacterium bifidum IFO 14252 showed binding of Trp-P-1, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido(1,2-a:3',2'- d)imidazole, 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline, 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f) quinoline, and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoxaline. The cell wall skeleton of S. cremoris group and Streptococcus lactis also showed the binding activity with A N-nitrosodimethylamine. The binding of Trp-P-1 to cell walls was very high, and the binding of mutagenic pyrolyzates was variable with different bacterial species. The peptidoglycan complex and polysaccharides liberated from cell wall skeleton of S. cremoris Z-25 showed strong binding of Trp-P-2. Peptidoglycans has a binding effect of about 19.86 micrograms/mg; polysaccharides had a binding effect of 14 micrograms/mg.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - A promoter probe vector, pTG244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). pTG244 is based on the Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector pTG222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of Bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. Random Sau3A fragments from the S. thermophilus A054 chromosomal DNA were cloned upstream of the cat-86 gene by using E. coli as the host. The pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into S. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. For S. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. Direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in L. lactis subsp. lactis. Six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in S. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. Three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. The 5' ends of their corresponding mRNAs were determined by S1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. Upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the E. coli sigma 70 and the Bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43 (or sigma A) consensus promoters were identified.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - [Cloning the gene of beta-galactosidase from the industrial strain of Streptococcus lactis 111 in E. coli cells and conjugated transfer of this gene to Streptococcus thermophilus cells].
AB  - The ability of the industrial strains of Streptococcus lactis to synthesize the enzyme beta-galactosidase was studied. Five strains among sixteen were found to produce high levels of the enzyme. The beta-galactosidase gene in the most active strain Streptococcus lactis 111 was shown to be located on the 50 kb conjugative plasmid. The plasmid was transferred by conjugation into Streptococcus thermophilus cells and subsequently the gene for beta-galactosidase was studied in transconjugants. The beta-galactosidase gene from Streptococcus lactis 111 was subcloned in Escherichia coli cells on the plasmid pBR322. The gene was localized on the 4.8 kb BgIII fragment of DNA. Following the restriction of DNA by the Sau3A the gene was subcloned on the birepliconed plasmid vector pCB20 capable of replication in the Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive microorganisms. The recombinant derivatives of pCB20 were isolated that carry the beta-galactosidase gene on the DNA fragments of different size.
TI  - [Ultrastructural features of Rhodococcus rubropertinctus and Streptococcus lactis dissociants].
AB  - Three Rhodococcus rubropertinctus dissociants (R, S and M) and two Streptococcus  lactis dissociants (R and S) were compared using the electron microscopy method of negative contrasting. The cell wall of R.rubropertinctus dissociants had a thickness of 40 nm (R), 30 nm (S) and 20 nm (M). The cell wall of S. lactis dissociants was 35-55 nm (R) and 25-30 nm (S) thick. 1.5-2-fold variations in the thickness of cell walls could account for the different resistance of the dissociants against the action of such external factors as dehydration, antibiotics, UV, elevated NaCl concentrations, etc.
TI  - Immunoblotting and culture positive endocarditis.
AB  - Serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus lactis and a "nutritionally" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. In S mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of IgM against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. In S pneumoniae IgM against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. In S agalactiae IgM against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. In S lactis endocarditis specific IgM was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and 58 kilodaltons. With the "nutritionally" variant streptococcus it was impossible to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls.
TI  - Species and type phages of lactococcal bacteriophages.
AB  - Lactococcal phages are classified according to morphology and DNA homology. Phages are differentiated into 12 phage species, and type phages of each species are proposed. Members and possible members of each species are named. Available data on type phages are tabulated including morphology, DNA characteristics and phage protein bands.
TI  - Natural transfer of conjugative transposon Tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative streptococcal transposon Tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. Enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for Alcaligenes eutrophus, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). No transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. Mating of an E. coli strain carrying Tn916 yielded transconjugants with Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). Acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. The results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as Tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially contributing to bacterial evolution.
TI  - [Study of nisin, a polypeptide antibiotic produced by a culture of Streptococcus  lactis, strain MSU].
AB  - The drug nisin produced by the lactic acid bacteria S. lactis, strain MSU, was identified and described. After 18-hour cultivation of the strain the fermentation broth was centrifuged. The centrifugate contained at an average 2000 IU/ml of the antibiotic. It was purified on silica gel C-3, the eluate was lyophilized and the dry substance was studied by disk electrophoresis in 20 per cent PAAG in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate. It was found that S. lactis, strain MSU, produced a polypeptide component of the molecular weight of 7000 D. Its electrophoretic mobility corresponded to that of nisaplin. Therefore, nisin was shown to be identical to nisaplin.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis caused by Streptococcus lactis and assisted by immunoblotting of serum antibodies.
AB  
TI  - Cloning, expression, and sequence determination of a bacteriophage fragment encoding bacteriophage resistance in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A number of host-encoded phage resistance mechanisms have been described in lactococci. However, the phage genome has not been exploited as a source of additional resistance determinants. A 4.5-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment of phage nck202.50 (phi 50) was subcloned in streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid pSA3 and introduced into Lactococcus lactis NCK203 and MG1363 by protoplast transformation. This cloned phage fragment directed a bacteriophage resistance phenotype designated Per (phage-encoded resistance). Both phi 50 and a distantly related phage, nck202.48 (phi 48), formed small plaques on strain NCK213 at a slightly reduced efficiency of plaquing on the Per+ host. The per locus was further reduced to a 1.4-kb fragment through in vitro deletion analysis. The 1.4-kb fragment was sequenced, and the Per phenotype was found to be associated with a ca. 500-bp region rich in direct and inverted repeats. We present evidence that the Per region contains a phage origin of replication which, in trans, may interfere with phage replication by titration of DNA polymerase or other essential replication factors. It was demonstrated that the Per+ phenotype is not a result of reduced adsorption or action of a restriction and modification system. Per+ activity was not detected against six independent phages which were previously shown to be sensitive to the Hsp+ mechanism. The mutually exclusive resistance mechanisms could be combined to confer resistance to both types of phages (Hsp resistant and Per resistant) in a single host. This is the first description in lactococci of a phage resistance phenotype, other than superinfection immunity, originating from a lactococcal phage genome.
TI  - Identification of lactococci and enterococci by colony hybridization with 23S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Specific sequences of 23S rRNA of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccus faecium, and Enterococcus malodoratus/Enterococcus avium were identified, and complementary oligonucleotide probes were synthesized. The specificity of the probes was evaluated by dot blot and colony hybridizations. The probes can be used for the specific detection and identification of colonies of the corresponding species in mixed cultures.
TI  - Microbiology of 'obiolor': a Nigerian fermented non-alcoholic beverage.
AB  - Obiolor is an acidic non-alcoholic beverage prepared by fermenting sorghum and millet malts. The traditional process for the production and microbiological characteristics of the beverage were investigated. Bacillus spp., Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus lactis were the associated micro-organisms most actively involved. Yeasts were present in low numbers towards the end of the fermentation. Other micro-organisms isolated did not appear to play a role in the fermentation process. Variations in the important microbial groups involved and their metabolic products were studied. Titratable acidity increased gradually until the end of the fermentation while the total soluble solids and pH declined. Acetobacter spp. were probably responsible for the unacceptability of the product after 24 h.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Streptococcus lactis carrying the Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen gene.
AB  - A recombinant Streptococcus lactis strain which carries the structural gene for a surface protein antigen (PAc) of 190,000 daltons from Streptococcus mutans serotype c was constructed for development of an oral vaccine against dental caries. The gene from S. mutans MT8148 joined to shuttle vector pSA3 was successfully transformed into S. lactis IL1403. A small amount of PAc was detected in the cell homogenate and cytoplasmic fraction of the recombinant S. lactis, but not in the culture supernatant of the recombinant, by Western immunoblotting and dot immunoblotting. The level of PAc-specific mRNA in the recombinant strain was lower than that in S. mutans MT8148. However, significant salivary immunoglobulin A and serum immunoglobulin G responses to PAc were induced in mice immunized orally with the recombinant S. lactis.
TI  - Plus-origin mapping of single-stranded DNA plasmid pE194 and nick site homologies with other plasmids.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194 manifests a natural thermosensitivity for replication and can be established in several species, both gram positive and gram negative, thus making it attractive for use as a delivery vector. Like most characterized plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pE194 generates single-stranded DNA. The direction of pE194 replication is clockwise, as determined by the strandedness of free single-stranded DNA. Significant homology exists between a 50-base-pair sequence in the origin of pE194 and sequences present in plasmids pMV158 (Streptococcus agalactiae), pADB201 (Mycoplasma mycoides), and pSH71 (Lactococcus lactis). We used an initiation-termination reaction, in which pE194 initiates replication at its own origin and is induced to terminate at the related pMV158 sequence, to demonstrate that pE194 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism; the initiation nick site was localized to an 8-base-pair sequence.
TI  - Simultaneous loss of N5-(carboxyethyl)ornithine synthase, nisin production, and sucrose-fermenting ability by Lactococcus lactis K1.
AB  - A spontaneous derivative of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis K1 (formerly Streptococcus lactis K1) lacking N5-(carboxyethyl)ornithine synthase (EC 1.5.1.24) was isolated. This mutant had also lost the abilities to ferment sucrose and to produce the antibiotic nisin. Hybridization studies indicate that these linked traits are encoded on the chromosome of L. lactis K1 and that they may be located on a conjugative transposon.
TI  - [Prevention of caries with lactobacillus (final results of a clinical trial on dental caries with killed lactobacillus [streptococcus and lactobacillus] given orally)].
AB  - Caries prevention with lactic bacteria. (Final results of a dental caries clinical trial using heat killed lactic bacteria [streptococci and lactobacilli] orally.) The results of a dental caries clinical trial in 245 seven-year-old children are reported. Chewable tablets of two different types were prepared: A) Containing pyridoxine (Vit. B6) and heat killed lactic bacteria. B) Placebo tablets with pyridoxine only. They were randomly given once a week for 16 weeks to experimental and control groups respectively. Four evaluation surveys were conducted during 24 months of follow up, using the "Decay, Missing, Filled, Surfaces" index (DMFS) for the clinical evaluation of the permanent teeth. A consistent reduction in the incidence of dental caries in the experimental group was observed in all 4 surveys. After 2 years of follow up a 42% reduction in the incidence rate of dental caries was observed in the experimental group compared to the control group. Summary tables and discussion of the clinical evaluation surveys are given. The potential use of these clinical findings as support for a future dental caries vaccine evaluation project is proposed.
TI  - [Joint culturing of Streptococcus lactis, strain MGU with Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus mesentericus].
AB  - Nisin synthesis by Streptococcus lactis, strain MGU, grown as a combined culture  together with Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus mesentericus under stationary conditions or with stirring does not depend on the quantity of inoculated associated cells. Nisin synthesis in the combined culture drops down by 10-20% at the initial pH 7.5 of the growth medium which is unfavourable for S. lactis producing nisin. The level of nisin biosynthesis does not rise when the pH of the medium is adjusted (either naturally or artificially) to 6.6-6.8 in the presence of glucose and yeast autolysate. S. lactis inhibits the growth of B. mesentericus when grown together with it whereas P. vulgaris inhibits the growth of S. lactis in their combined culture.
TI  - [Various aspects of protoplast production in Streptococcus lactis].
AB  - The authors studied the effect of some factors, including the conditions of preincubation, the action of 2-mercaptoethanol, EDTA, alpha-amylase, on protoplast production in four strains of Streptococcus lactis caused by lysozyme. The strains differed in the nisin-producing activity and in the structure of the cell walls that were not affected with lysozyme without either preincubation in 2-mercaptoethanol or in a salt medium with minimal inhibitory concentrations of DL-threonine. EDTA and alpha-amylase increased the lysozyme effect. Among seven buffer systems studied the most favourable for protoplast production in S. lactis is the ammonia-citric buffer with EDTA, and the best regeneration medium is the agar salt medium to which, depending on the strain, either glucose or sucrose should be added as a stabilizer.
TI  - Differences in short peptide-substrate cleavage by two cell-envelope-located serine proteinases of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris are related to secondary binding specificity.
AB  - Various chromophoric peptides have been tested as substates for two genetically related types (PI and PIII) of cell-envelope proteinases of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. The positively charged peptide methoxy-succinyl-arginyl-prolyl-tyrosyl-p-nitroanilide appeared to be cleaved with the highest catalytic efficiency by both enzymes, although in the case of PIII only at high ionic strength. A cation binding site in the PI-type proteinase that is not present in the related PIII-type appears to be mainly responsible for the difference between these enzymes with respect to the rate of conversion of this chromophoric substrate at relatively low ionic strength. This cation binding site most probably resides in the aspartic acid residue 166, which in PIII is substituted by asparagine. Substitution of the threonine residue 138 by lysine in PIII may also play a role. The binding step in the reaction pathway catalysed by PI at low ionic strength is governed mainly by an ionic interaction involving the cation binding site. In addition, hydrophobic interactions contribute to the binding process. Masking of the cation binding site only increases the Michaelis constant Km; the catalytic constant kcat is not affected. In the absence of the cation binding site (viz. in PIII) the free energy derived from the hydrophobic interactions only is too small to promote binding of the substrate effectively. High activities are measured only if a high ionic strength is introduced. Removal of electrostatic repulsion between the substrate and positively charged residues of the enzyme, among which is lysine 138, may contribute to this activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Properties of 2,3-Butanediol Dehydrogenases from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in Relation to Citrate Fermentation.
AB  - Two 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenases (enzymes 1 and 2; molecular weight of each, 170,000) have been partially purified from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (Streptococcus diacetylactis) D10 and shown to have reductase activity with either diacetyl or acetoin as the substrate. However, the reductase activity with 10 mM diacetyl was far greater for both enzymes (7.0- and 4.7-fold for enzymes 1 and 2, respectively) than with 10 mM acetoin as the substrate. In contrast, when acetoin and diacetyl were present together, acetoin was the preferred substrate for both enzymes, with enzyme 1 showing the more marked preference for acetoin. meso-2,3-Butanediol was the only isomeric product, with enzyme 1 independent of the substrate combinations. For enzyme 2, both the meso and optical isomers of 2,3-butanediol were formed with acetoin as the substrate, but only the optical isomers were produced with diacetyl as the substrate. With batch cultures of strain D10 at or near the point of citrate exhaustion, the main isomers of 2,3-butanediol present were the optical forms. If the pH was sufficiently high (>pH 5), acetoin reduction occurred over time and was followed by diacetyl reduction, and meso-2,3-butanediol became the predominant isomer. Interconversion of the optical isomers into the meso isomer did occur. The properties of 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenases are consistent with diacetyl and acetoin removal and the appearance of the isomers of 2,3-butanediol.
TI  - Insertion elements on lactococcal proteinase plasmids.
AB  - DNA segments of 809 and 808 nucleotides, with 18-base-pair terminal inverted repeats, are present on the proteinase plasmids pWV05 from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 and pSK111 from L. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11, respectively. These DNA segments are highly similar: 77% identical nucleotides and both contain an open reading frame that can encode a protein of 226 amino acids. Furthermore, both DNA segments are located downstream of the proteinase maturation gene prtM, but they differ individually in their orientation with respect to the prtM gene. On the basis of the striking similarity between ISS1, an 808-base-pair insertion sequence (IS) from L. lactis subsp. lactis ML3 lactose plasmid pSK08, and the DNA segments of pWV05 and pSK111, we propose that these DNA segments comprise IS elements. The IS elements from strains Wg2 and SK11 were named ISS1W and ISS1N, respectively. On pWV05, ISS1W is flanked on one side by only part of a second IS element, indicating that pWV05 evolved as a deletion derivative of a precursor plasmid that carried at least two IS elements.
TI  - High-frequency, site-specific recombination between lactococcal and pAM beta 1 plasmid DNAs.
AB  - In vivo recombination events involving the 75-kilobase lactose proteinase plasmid pCI301 of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis UC317 and the conjugative enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 were analyzed. A fragment, identified as containing the pCI301 recombination site, mediated greatly elevated levels of mobilization and recombination with pAM beta 1 when cloned in a nonmobilizable L. lactis-Escherichia coli shuttle vector. This latter recombination event was site and orientation specific on both plasmids. Recombination on pAM beta 1 was within the region associated with plasmid replication, but no effect on pAM beta 1 replication functions was detected. Resolution of recombinant plasmids generated derivatives indistinguishable from the parental plasmids.
TI  - Influence of aflatoxin B1 on gas production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The main characteristic of homofermentative lactic acid bacteria is that they do  not produce gas from glucose and other sugars. However, in these experiments Lactobacillus casei, Lb. plantarum and Streptococcus lactis in broth media with glucose, galactose, lactose and sucrose, and aflatoxin B1 produces acid and also a significant amount of gas. In the control media without aflatoxin, these bacteria did not produce gas. The data suggest that lactic acid bacteria, known until now as homofermentative, become heterofermentative because of the influence of aflatoxin B1. The results of these investigations are of practical value because they may explain the defect of cheese "blowing," which can appear in Trapist cheese vacuum packed in foil. This type of unusual "blowing" occurs approximately one month after cheese manufacture. This defect can be characterized by very large holes and cracks inside the cheese. The flavor is similar to that of young cheese, which can be very undesirable for a ripened, Trapist, aged cheese.
TI  - Molecular characterization of promoters of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris temperate bacteriophage BK5-T and identification of a phage gene implicated in the regulation of promoter activity.
AB  - DNA fragments from the temperate lactococcal bacteriophage BK5-T were cloned into the promoter-detecting plasmid pMU1328. Five DNA fragments conferring promoter activity were selected by transformation of Streptococcus sanguis and were functional in Escherichia coli, S. sanguis, and Lactococcus lactis subspp. lactis and cremoris. The nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined, and primer extension analysis was used to locate the site of initiation of transcription from each promoter in both E. coli and S. sanguis. Transcription was initiated from the same nucleotide in these two organisms, and the promoters contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequence for E. coli promoters. The activities of three of the five promoters were decreased two- to threefold when a compatible plasmid containing a 3.8-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment (EcoRI-f) of BK5-T was coresident with the promoter-containing plasmid in either L. lactis subsp. cremoris or E. coli. Data from Tn5 mutagenesis, subcloning experiments, and DNA sequence analysis indicate that this decrease in promoter activity requires a region of EcoRI-f that contains a 621-base-pair open reading frame. This region has been designated bpi (for BK5-T promoter inhibitor).
TI  - Recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from children.
AB  - A cross-sectional survey of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (VRGPC) in the feces of children was initiated after several bacteremic infections with these organisms occurred at our hospital. A selective medium consisting of colistin-nalidixic acid agar, 5% sheep blood, vancomycin (5 mg/liter), and amphotericin B (8 mg/liter) was developed to isolate VRGPC. A single stool specimen submitted to the clinical microbiology laboratory from each of 48 patients was inoculated onto the medium. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C with 5% carbon dioxide and examined at 24, 48, and 72 h. Susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution. A total of 14 isolates from 11 of 48 (22%) children were recovered. The density of growth ranged from a single colony to 2+. The VRGPC were identified as Leuconostoc lactis (n = 2), Lactobacillus confusus (n = 4), Enterococcus species (n = 5), and Lactococcus lactis (n = 3). One strain of Lactobacillus confusus was recovered from both the stool and the blood of one of these patients. The MICs of vancomycin were 4 micrograms/ml for one of the isolates, 8 micrograms/ml for four of the isolates, and more than 16 micrograms/ml for the remaining eight isolates. All isolates were susceptible to both penicillin and ampicillin. Only 1 of the 11 children had received prior treatment with vancomycin. We conclude that low concentrations of VRGPC may be common in the gastrointestinal tracts of children.
TI  - Antagonistic action of lactic cultures toward spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of cell-free filtrate from lactic cultures were assessed against 10 bacterial cultures. All the five species of lactic culture examined showed antimicrobial activity against tested bacteria. S. aureus was least sensitive of the tested bacteria, followed by E. coli and S. typhosa. E. aerogenes was the most sensitive one. L. casei had the greatest antimicrobial activity. Leu. mesenteroides weakly inhibited the growth of the tested bacteria. In general, inoculum density had little effect on inhibition.
TI  - Bacterial growth in mastitic whey in relation to bacterial association with mastitis.
AB  - The growth of mastitis pathogens (eight strains) and non-pathogenic bacteria (eight strains) was studied using microturbidometry. All bacteria grew well in whey originating from uninflamed quarters. However, the growth of bacteria which are not considered to be mastitis pathogens (Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) became suppressed by whey from mastitic quarters. On the contrary, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was generally better in mastitic samples. Streptococcus agalactiae showed inconsistent results.
TI  - General mechanism for the bacterial toxicity of hypochlorous acid: abolition of ATP production.
AB  - The adenylate energy charges (EC) of Escherichia coli 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, and Streptococcus lactis 7962 rapidly fell in nutrient-rich media from values in excess of 0.9 to below 0.1 when the organisms were exposed to lethal levels of HOCl. The same cells maintained in energy-depleted states were incapable of attaining normal EC values necessary for biosynthesis and growth when challenged with nutrient energy sources after HOCl exposure. These changes correlated quantitatively with loss of replicative capabilities. Initial rates of transport of glucose, succinate, and various amino acids that act as respiratory substrates and the ATP hydrolase activity of the F1 complex from the ATP synthase of E. coli 25922 also declined in parallel with or preceded loss of viability. These results establish that cellular death is accompanied by complete disruption of bacterial ATP production by both oxidative and fermentative pathways as a consequence of inhibition of inner membrane bound systems responsible for these processes.
TI  - Improved electroporation efficiency of intact Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis cells grown in defined media.
AB  - The impact of growth conditions on electroporation of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LM0230 (previously designated Streptococcus lactis LM0230) was evaluated. Cells grown in M17 broth supplemented with 0.5% glucose (M17-Glu) and two chemically defined synthetic media, FMC and RPMI 1640, all supplemented with 0.24% DL-threonine or 0.5% glycine, were harvested, washed with double-distilled water, diluted, and porated in the presence of 1 microgram of pGB301 DNA with a Transfector 100 (BTX, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) or a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). Transformants were recovered at consistently higher efficiencies for cells grown in FMC or RPMI 1640 (10(3) to 10(4) transformants per micrograms of DNA) than for cells grown in M17-Glu (10(1) to 10(2) transformants per micrograms of DNA). Other parameters influencing electroporation of L. lactis cells grown in chemically defined media were growth phase and final concentration of cells, concentration of plasmid DNA, voltage achieved during poration, and expression conditions. A high degree of variability in transformation efficiencies was evident for replicate samples of cells pulsed with either electroporation machine. A trend toward decreased variability was observed for duplicate samples of cells prepared on the same day. In addition, storage studies done with a large batch of cells prepared on the same day indicated that freezing dry cell pellets at -60 degrees C had no deleterious effect on transformation efficiencies over a 30-day period when a new 0.2-cm cuvette was used for porating each sample.
TI  - Enzyme activities of cell-free extracts from mutant strains of lactic streptococci subjected to sublethal heating or freeze-thawing.
AB  - Two mutant lactose-negative (Lac-), proteinase-negative (Prt-) strains of lactic  streptococci, Streptococcus lactis 25Sp and S. cremoris KHA2, and their parents, S. lactis C2 and S. cremoris KH Lac+ Prt+, were grown in a suitable medium with the pH maintained at 6.5 by addition of NH4OH. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and then heated sublethally at 54 or 69 degrees C for 15 sec. Cells also were frozen and stored for 1 week at -20 or -100 degrees C. Cell-free extracts of cells heated at 54 degrees C had more proteinase and aminopeptidase activities than did a similar extract of cells heated at 69 degrees C. The greatest enzyme activities occurred in the cell-free extracts prepared from cells frozen and stored at -100 degrees C. Specific activities of proteinase and dipeptidase generally decreased in extracts of freeze-shocked cells compared to those in extracts of untreated cells. Enzyme activity of extracts also decreased in the presence of 5% NaCl at pH 5.0. Cell-free extracts at pH values of 5 to 8 were heated at 69 degrees C for 1.5, or 10 min. Heating them for 10 min caused a loss of dipeptidase activity which was most pronounced at pH 5.0 and least pronounced at pH 7.0.
TI  - Response of Lactococcus (Streptococcus) lactis to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine: absence of adaptive response.
AB  - Pretreatment of cells of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis with low levels of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine does not reduce the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects caused by high concentration of this agent. This observation indicates that there is no efficient inducible error-free repair system for alkylation damage similar to the 'adaptive response' described in detail for Escherichia coli.
TI  - Insertion and amplification of foreign genes in the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis chromosome.
AB  - The plasmid pE194 is unable to replicate in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (formerly Streptococcus lactis). When linked to resident bacteriophage sequences, pE194 was able to integrate into the L. lactis subsp. lactis chromosome either by Campbell-like recombination or by double crossing over with deletion. Integration occurred into the DNA of the prophage and prevented its multiplication. When a selective pressure was applied to an integrant in which pE194 was flanked by two direct repeats of prophage fragment, amplification of pE194 and the prophage fragment was observed. The pE194 copy number was assessed at six to nine, and amplification was stable upon growth under nonselective conditions.
TI  - Localization, cloning, and expression of genetic determinants for bacteriophage resistance (Hsp) from the conjugative plasmid pTR2030.
AB  - Genetic determinants for a bacteriophage resistance mechanism (Hsp+) encoded by plasmid pTR2030 (46.2 kilobases [kb]) were localized by mapping an 11.5-kb deletion that accompanied the transition of Lactococcus lactis LMA12-4 transconjugants (M. E. Sanders, P. J. Leonard, W. D. Sing, and T. R. Klaenhammer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 52:1001-1007, 1986) from phage resistance to phage sensitivity. The deleted 34.7-kb replicon (pTR2023, Hsp-) retained its conjugative ability, demonstrating that the phage resistance and conjugal transfer determinants were genetically distinct. The Hsp region of pTT2030, which was contained within a 13.6-kb BglII fragment, was cloned into the BamHI site of bacteriophage lambda EMBL3, and Hsp was subcloned into the Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector pSA3. The recombinant plasmids pTK6 and pTK9 were recovered in E. coli HB101 and contained a 13.6-kb insert in opposite orientations. L. Lactis MG1363 transformants carrying pTK6 or pTK9 exhibited a significant reduction in plaque size, in addition to a slight reduction in the efficiency of plaquing for both prolate and small isometric phages. Phenotypic reactions observed for the recombinant plasmids suggest that pTR2030-encoded Hsp acts similarly against both prolate and small isometric phages. Tn5 mutagenesis was used to define the region essential for the expression of the Hsp+ phenotype. Any of four insertions within a 3-kb region resulted in the loss of phage resistance, whereas a further 26 insertions outside this locus had no effect on Hsp expression. In vitro deletion analysis confirmed that the 3-kb region contained all the information necessary for the observed resistance.
TI  - Effect of Streptococcus lactis preparation in diet of mice on inhibiting age-dependent loss of superoxide dismutase activity in tissues.
AB  - SL-diet was prepared using commercial pellets supplemented with 1% pulverized Streptococcus lactis (SL). SL fed group of ICR strain mice were bred from 8 weeks up to 75 weeks. End-point age for survival in these mice was approximately 75 weeks. No significant differences in survival rate were observed at 75 weeks between the commercial diet and SL-diet group. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the liver, brain and erythrocytes of 75-week-old mice significantly decreased compared with those aged 10 weeks. Cu.Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD activities in the liver and brain of SL-diet mice were maintained in similar degree in the juvenile group, however, decreased significantly in the commercial diet group. SOD in erythrocytes was slightly decreased and no significant difference was noted in either group.
TI  - N5-(L-1-carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine:NADP+ oxidoreductase from Streptococcus lactis. Purification and partial characterization.
AB  - N5-(L-1-Carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine:NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.5.1.-) from Streptococcus lactis K1 has been purified 8,000-fold to homogeneity. The NADPH-dependent enzyme mediates the reductive condensation between pyruvic acid and the delta- or epsilon-amino groups of L-ornithine and L-lysine to form N5-(L-1-carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine and N6-(L-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine, respectively. The five-step purification procedure involves ion-exchange (DE52 and phosphocellulose P-11), gel filtration (Ultrogel AcA 44), and affinity chromatography (2',5'-ADP-Sepharose 4B). Approximately 100-200 micrograms of purified enzyme of specific activity 40 units/mg were obtained from 60 g of cells, wet weight. Anionic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single enzymatically active protein band, whereas three species (pI 4.8-5.1) were detected by analytical electrofocusing. The purified enzyme is active over a broad pH range of 6.5-9.0 and is stable to heating at 50 degrees C for 10 min. Substrate Km values were determined to be: NADPH, 6.6 microM; pyruvate, 150 microM; ornithine, 3.3 mM; and lysine, 18.2 mM. The oxidoreductase has a relative molecular mass (Mr = 150,000) as estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography exclusion chromatography and by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Conventional gel filtration indicated an Mr = 78,000, and a single protein band of Mr = 38,000 was revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is composed of identical subunits of Mr = 38,000, which may associate to yield both dimeric and tetrameric forms. Polyclonal antibody to the purified protein inhibited enzyme activity. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is reported, and the sequence of the first 37 amino acids from the NH2 terminus has been determined by stepwise Edman degradation.
TI  - Genome comparison of Lactococcus strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The two restriction enzymes SmaI and ApaI were found to produce distributions of  DNA fragments useful for genome analysis of some lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genome size was estimated to be 1750 to 2500 kb depending on the species. Each strain displayed unique restriction patterns; nevertheless, the percentage of the comigrating fragments of two isogenic or closely related strains was about 80% and fell to 20-40% when the patterns of two non-related strains of the same species or two strains belonging to different species were compared.
TI  - Identification of a gene required for maturation of an extracellular lactococcal  serine proteinase.
AB  - Directly upstream of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 proteinase gene is an oppositely directed open reading frame (ORF1). The complete nucleotide sequence of ORF1, encoding a 33-kilodalton protein, was determined. A protein of approximately 32 kilodaltons was synthesized when ORF1 was expressed in Escherichia coli by using a T7 RNA polymerase-specific promoter. L. lactis subsp. lactis MG1363 transformants carrying the proteinase gene but lacking ORF1 were phenotypically proteinase deficient, unlike transformants carrying both the proteinase gene and ORF1. Synthesis and secretion of proteinase antigen by L. lactis could be detected with proteinase-directed monoclonal antibodies regardless of whether ORF1 was present. The requirement of ORF1 for proteinase activation was reflected in a reduction in the molecular weight of the secreted proteinase. Furthermore, deletion of the 130 C-terminal amino acids of the Wg2 proteinase prevented attachment of the enzyme to lactococcal cells.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a cell wall-associated proteinase gene from Streptococcus lactis NCDO763.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis NCDO763 harbours a plasmid designated pLP763. The cells harbouring pLP763 are able to grow to a higher density in milk because of their proteinase-positive phenotype (Prt+). The 6.2 kb HindIII-PstI fragment from pLP763 was found to be responsible for the Prt+ phenotype. The DNA fragment contains an incomplete large open reading frame (ORF). Further sequence analysis downstream from the PstI site revealed that the ORF consists of 5706 bases. It was found that the deduced amino acid sequence consisting of 1902 amino acid residues was extremely similar to that of the Wg2 proteinase, a serine protease from Streptococcus cremoris, suggesting that both genes were derived from a common ancestral gene.
TI  - Genetic transformation of intact Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by high-voltage electroporation.
AB  - To apply recombinant DNA techniques for genetic manipulation of the industrially  important lactococci, an efficient and reliable high-frequency transformation system must be available. High-voltage electric pulses have been demonstrated to enhance uptake of DNA into protoplasts and intact cells of numerous gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. The objective of this study was to develop a system for electroporating intact cells of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LM0230 (previously designated Streptococcus lactis LM0230) with a commercially available electroporation unit (BTX Transfector 100; BTX, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Parameters which influenced the efficiency of transformation included growth phase and final concentration of cells, ionic strength of the suspending medium, concentration of plasmid DNA, and the amplitude and duration of the pulse. Washed suspensions of intact cells suspended in deionized distilled water were subjected to one high-voltage electric pulse varying in voltage (300 to 900 V corresponding to field strengths of 5 to 17 kV/cm) and duration (100 microseconds to 1 s). Transformation efficiencies of 10(3) transformants per microgram of DNA were obtained when dense suspensions (final concentration, 5 x 10(10) CFU/ml) of stationary-phase cells were subjected to one pulse with a peak voltage of 900 V (field strength, 17 kV/cm) and a pulse duration of 5 ms in the presence of plasmid DNA. Dilution of porated cells in broth medium followed by an expression period of 2 h at 30 degrees C was beneficial in enhancing transformation efficiencies. Plasmids ranging in size from 9.8 to 30.0 kilobase pairs could be transformed by this procedure.
TI  - Nisin, a peptide antibiotic: cloning and sequencing of the nisA gene and posttranslational processing of its peptide product.
AB  - Nisin produced by Streptococcus lactis is used as a food preservative and is the  most important member of a group of antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges. To understand the genetic basis of these so-called lantibiotics (Schnell et al., Nature 333:276-278, 1988), we characterized the nisin structural gene, nisA, which is located on a plasmid and codes for a 57-amino-acid prepeptide. The prepeptide is processed posttranslationally to the pentacyclic antibiotic. Although nisin and the recently elucidated lantibiotic epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis are produced by different organisms, their gene organization is identical. As with epidermin, the nisin propeptide corresponds to the C-terminus of the prepeptide. The N-terminus of the prepeptide is cleaved at a characteristic splice site (Pro--2 Arg--1 Ile-+1). Remarkably, the N-terminus of prenisin shares 70% similarity with preepidermin, although the propeptide sequences are distinctly different. The structural similarities between these two lantibiotics are consistent with the fact that there is a common mechanism of biosynthesis of these lanthionine-containing antibiotics.
TI  - A new simple method of curing plasmids in lactic streptococci (Streptococcus cremoris; Streptococcus lactis, plasmids).
AB  - A simple method for curing plasmid DNA from lactic streptococci is described. When strains of lactic streptococci are grown overnight at 32 degrees C in an unbuffered medium (M17-) and held at the same temperature for an extended period (96 h), the acid environment induces loss of plasmid DNA of different sizes. If the process of growth in M17- broth followed by extended incubation at 32 degrees C is repeated, most of the plasmids are lost, as revealed by gel electrophoretic profiles of DNA. The method is simple and efficient in curing plasmids of lactic streptococci without use of any mutagenic chemical.
TI  - Sugar Utilization and Acid Production by Free and Entrapped Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in a Whey Permeate Medium.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. Bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. Cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). Values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. Immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Entrapped cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. The kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by L. lactis subsp. lactis and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.
TI  - IS257 from Staphylococcus aureus: member of an insertion sequence superfamily prevalent among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences for the IS257 family of insertion sequences from Staphylococcus aureus were compared with those of the ISS1 family from Streptococcus lactis and the IS15 family which is widespread amongst Gram-negative bacteria. These elements have a striking degree of similarity in both their putative transposase polypeptide sequences and their nucleotide sequences (40 to 64% between pairs), including 12 out of 14 bp conservation in their terminal inverted repeats. The evolutionary distance between the IS15 family and the IS257 and ISS1 families of Gram-positive origin is approximately twice that between the IS257 and ISS1 families. Analysis of base substitutions in the three sequences has provided insights into the effect of selection for the G + C content of immigrant genes to conform to that of their hosts, and into the evolution of biases in overall amino acid composition of cellular proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The IS257, ISS1, IS15 families form a superfamily of insertion sequences that has been involved in the spread of a number of antimicrobial resistance determinants in Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [A mutant of Streptococcus lactis with resistance to bacteriophages isolated in Argentina and the United States of America].
AB  - Streptococcus lactis and Streptococcus cremoris have an important role in the fermentation of milk during the manufacturing of lactic products. Bacteriophages are spread in the plant environment and they may infect the starters causing technical and economic problems to the dairy industry. It is now known that the usual methods of control are not completely safe against the proliferation of phages. It is necessary therefore to include resistant strains to the phages which infect the plant. This study introduces a simple and direct method to obtain spontaneous mutants which have performed clear resistance to a certain phage. The prolate (ARG) phages used in this work St11, St13 and St15 were isolated in Argentina, on S. lactis C2 while the prolate and isometric (AM) phages phi C2, D59-1, I16-1, and G72-1, F4-1, I37-1 respectively, were isolated in Cornell University. on the corresponding S. lactis strains except the phage D59-1 isolated on an S. cremoris strain. The propagation of phages was performed using M and M17 broth. The phage sensitivity was tested through spot test and overlay plaque plating method expressing the titre of phage suspension. as PFU/ml. In order to obtain spontaneous resistant mutants of S. lactis C2 to phage St15, and active culture of S. lactis C2 (sensitive) was spread on agar M plates, inoculated with drops of a suspension of phage St15 (10(8)PFU/ml) and incubated at 30 degrees C for 48 h. Colonies of mutants grown in the lytic areas caused by the phage were isolated and selected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Structure, expression, and evolution of a gene encoding the precursor of nisin, a small protein antibiotic.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced a gene (spaN) from Streptococcus lactis ATCC 11454 which encodes the peptide precursor of the small protein antibiotic nisin. The encoded precursor is 57 amino acids long, with a 23-residue leader region and a 34-residue structural region. The structural region contains serines, threonines, and cysteines at exactly the positions required to give mature nisin by a series of post-translational modifications involving dehydration of serines and threonines to dehydro forms, and cross-linking with cysteine residues. S1 mapping revealed a 267-nucleotide transcript of the nisin gene that is expressed during vegetative growth and stationary phase. It has a half-life of 7-10 min. The absence of an identifiable promoter or rho-independent terminator and the detection of two different 5'-ends of the transcript suggested it is a processing product from a larger RNA. This may represent a polycistronic mRNA which may also encode proteins involved in processing the nisin precursor peptide. Open reading frames were found in regions flanking the nisin gene. The one downstream had a ribosome binding site and appeared to be transcribed by read-through from the nisin gene. The one upstream had significant homology to a putative transposase from the Escherichia coli IS2 insertion element. Comparison of gene sequence homologies between nisin and the other lanthionine antibiotics, subtilin and epidermin, indicated that they all evolved from a common ancestor. Corresponding leader peptide sequences showed mediocre amino acid homology, but nearly perfect hydropathic homologies, suggesting a common function. It is proposed that this function includes recognition signals or other information required for post-translational processing.
TI  - [Effect of amino acids on the growth of the lactic acid streptococci Streptococcus lactis and the process of their protoplast formation].
AB  
TI  - Evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pIP501 into strains of Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - The conjugative broad host range plasmid pIP501 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. With these transconjugants as donors the plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of Strep. thermophilus. There was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of Lact. helveticus. Transfer from Lact. helveticus to Strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. There was no evidence for the conjugal transfer of plasmid pIP501 into a strain of Lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either lactic streptococci or Lactobacillus sp.
TI  - Antitumor activity of lactic acid bacteria on a solid fibrosarcoma, sarcoma-180 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.
AB  - Antitumor activity of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus cremoris and Streptococcus lactis was investigated in solid mouse fibrosarcoma. Intratumor administration of lyophilised bacterial cells at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt resulted in the regression of tumors in a maximum number of animals. Intraperitoneal injection at the same dose resulted in a significant increase in the survival time but was ineffective in curing the animals. Intratumor injection of Streptococcus thermophilus at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt also inhibited the growth of fibrosarcoma accompanied by an increase in the survival time while intraperitoneal administration of S. thermophilus prolonged only the survival time and did not result in cure. In mice bearing the ascitic form of sarcoma-180 or Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, intraperitoneal administration of S. thermophilus resulted in complete cure in a very significant proportion of tumor-bearing mice. S. thermophilus was more effective in sarcoma-180 than in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The cured tumors did not recur.
TI  - Viability and metabolic capability are maintained by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus lactis at very low adenylate energy charge.
AB  - Metabolic regulation by nucleotides has been examined in several bacteria within  the context of the adenylate energy charge (EC) concept. The ECs of bacteria capable of only fermentative metabolism (Streptococcus lactis and the ATPase-less mutant Escherichia coli AN718) fell to less than 0.2 under carbon-limiting conditions, but the bacteria were able to step up the EC to greater than 0.8 upon exposure to nutrient sugars. Similarly, nongrowing E. coli 25922, whose EC had been artificially lowered to less than 0.1 by the addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), was able to immediately step up the EC to 0.8 to 0.9 upon the addition of glucose but was unable to respond to respiratory substrates. The EC of respiring bacteria (E. coli 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853) fell to 0.3 to 0.4 under certain limiting growth conditions, but the bacteria also responded immediately when challenged with succinate to give EC values greater than 0.8. These bacteria could not step up the EC with respiratory substrates in the presence of CCCP. For all bacteria, the loss of the ability to step up the EC was attributable to the loss of nutrient transport function. Mixtures of viable and HOCl-killed E. coli 25922 were able to step up the EC in proportion to the fraction of surviving cells. The data indicate that nucleotide phosphorylation levels are not regulatory in nongrowing bacteria but that the EC step-up achievable upon nutrient addition may be an accurate index of viability.
TI  - Cloning of nisin resistance determinant and replication origin on 7.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment of pNP40 from Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC3.
AB  - The nisin resistance determinant and an origin of replication on pNP40, a plasmid of about 60 kilobases that is present in Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC3, was cloned on a 7.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment. When self-ligated, this fragment existed as an independent replicon (pFM011) and contained a 2.6-kilobase EcoRI-XbaI fragment encoding nisin resistance.
TI  - Restriction and modification activities from Streptococcus lactis ME2 are encoded by a self-transmissible plasmid, pTN20, that forms cointegrates during mobilization of lactose-fermenting ability.
AB  - A self-transmissible (Tra+) plasmid encoding determinants for restriction and modification activities (R+/M+) from Streptococcus lactis ME2 was isolated and characterized. The 28-kilobase (kb) plasmid (pTN20) was detected in lactose-fermenting (Lac+) transconjugants generated from matings between S. lactis N1, and ME2 variant, and a plasmid-free recipient, S. lactis LM2301. The plaquing efficiencies of prolate- and small isometric-headed phages were reduced on transconjugants containing either pTN20 (R+/M+ Tra+) or 100-kb plasmids encoding Lac+, R+/M+, and Tra+. Lac+ transconjugants which harbored pTR1040 (Lac+) and pTN20 (R+/M+) were phenotypically R-/M- and transferred Lac+ at low frequency in subsequent matings to give rise to 100-kb R+/M+ plasmids. R+/M+ activities and high-frequency conjugal transfer ability were detected in Lac+ transconjugants that contained pTR1041 (Lac+) and pTN20 (R+/M+). No 100-kb R+/M+ plasmids were recovered after these matings, suggesting that pTR1041 was mobilized by pTN20 through a process that resembled plasmid donation. pTR1041 was identical to pTR1040 but contained an additional 3.3-kb DNA fragment. These data suggested that phenotypic expression of R+/M+ and Tra+ is affected by coresident Lac+ plasmids. Restriction enzyme analysis and hybridization reactions demonstrated that the 100-kb R+/M+ plasmid was formed by a cointegration event between pTR1040 (Lac+) and pTN20 (R+/M+ Tra+) during conjugal transfer via a conductive-type process. This is the first report that defines self-transmissible restriction and modification plasmids in the lactic streptococci.
TI  - Cloning and expression of an alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase gene from Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Streptococcus lactis gene coding for alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (ADC) was cloned in Escherichia coli. Subsequent subcloning in E. coli showed that the ADC gene was located within a 1.3-kilobase DNA fragment. The ADC gene was controlled by its own promoter. Gas chromatography showed that S. lactis and the transformed E. coli strains produced the two optical isomers of acetoin in different ratios.
TI  - Role of the arginine deiminase system in protecting oral bacteria and an enzymatic basis for acid tolerance.
AB  - The arginine deiminase system was found to function in protecting bacterial cells against the damaging effects of acid environments. For example, as little as 2.9 mM arginine added to acidified suspensions of Streptococcus sanguis at a pH of 4.0 resulted in ammonia production and protection against killing. The arginine deiminase system was found to have unusual acid tolerance in a variety of lactic acid bacteria. For example, for Streptococcus rattus FA-1, the pH at which arginolysis was reduced to 10% of the maximum was between 2.1 and 2.6, or more than 1 full pH unit below the minimum for glycolysis (pH 3.7), and more than 2 units below the minimum for growth in complex medium (pH 4.7). The acid tolerance of the arginine deiminase system appeared to be primarily molecular and to depend on the tolerance of individual enzymes rather than on the membrane physiology of the bacteria; pH profiles for the activities of arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate kinase in permeabilized cells showed that the enzymes were active at pHs of 3.1 or somewhat lower. Overall, it appeared that ammonia could be produced from arginine at low pH values, even by cells with damaged membranes, and that the ammonia could then protect the cells against acid damage until the environmental pH value rose sufficiently to allow for the reestablishment of a difference in pH (delta pH) across the cell membrane.
TI  - Influence of lactic starter inoculation, curd heating and ripening temperature on Staphylococcus aureus behaviour in Manchego cheese.
AB  - Growth and survival of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated in 52 lots of raw  ewe's milk Manchego cheese manufactured and ripened under different conditions. A 5.8-fold reduction in S. aureus counts after 60 days of ripening was obtained by inoculating milk with 1% Streptococcus lactis culture, and a further 2.0-fold reduction could be achieved by adding 0.1% Lactobacillus plantarum culture. Curd heating temperature had a significant effect on S. aureus survival, with counts 4-5 times lower in cheese from 30 degrees C curd than in cheese from curd heated at 36-40 degrees C. Ripening temperature was the parameter with the greatest influence on S. aureus counts, which reached in cheese cured at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C for 60 days levels 10 and 100 times lower, respectively, than in cheese held at 5 degrees C.
TI  - Mutagenesis in Streptococcus lactis exposed to UV irradiation and alkylating agents.
AB  - The lethal and mutagenic effects of various mutagens on three strains of Streptococcus lactis were investigated. Lethality studies demonstrated that S. lactis was relatively sensitive to UV irradiation, methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), and, to a lesser extent, to ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS). A spontaneous derivative Lac-, which has lost a 37-Md plasmid, was slightly more resistant and much less mutable than the wild-type after UV irradiation. Although the three strains were strongly mutated by EMS for the genetic marker assayed (Rifr), an increase in the mutation frequency was also observed after MMS and MNNG treatments.
TI  - Characterization of a cloned chromosomal fragment affecting the proteinase activity of Streptococcus lactis ssp. lactis.
AB  - Plasmid pVS8 (14.3 kbp) contains a 9.3 kbp fragment of Streptococcus lactis ssp.  lactis SSL135 chromosomal DNA associated with the ability of this strain to grow in milk. In this study, it was found that pVS8 complements a defective plasmid-linked proteinase gene of SSL135. Using deletions and insertions, it was found that the size of the complementing region of pVS8 is approximately 6.0 kbp, and that its main part is located within a 5.7 kbp BglII fragment.
TI  - New nomenclature of the non-rod-shaped lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria of the Lactococcus (formerly lactic Streptococcus) genus are described to emphasize certain less well-known facts of importance in their successful use as dairy starters. Other streptococci (non-rod forms) are briefly characterized to emphasize their usefulness in industrial milk fermentations.
TI  - Genetics of proteinases of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Because it is essential for good growth with concomitant rapid acid production, and for the production of flavorous peptides and amino acids, the proteolytic ability of lactic acid bacteria is of crucial importance for reliable dairy product quality. In view of this importance, considerable research has been carried out to characterize the enzymes involved. The intensified genetic research in the lactic acid streptococci and the development of gene cloning systems for these organisms have resulted in a rapid increase of genetic data on lactic streptococcal proteinases. By now, an evaluation of the biochemical, immunological and genetic data seems to be feasible. These data are discussed and integrated into a working model tentatively explaining some of the characteristics of the proteolytic systems of lactic acid streptococci.
TI  - Molecular cloning of lactose genes in dairy lactic streptococci: the phospho-beta-galactosidase and beta-galactosidase genes and their expression products.
AB  - The mesophilic (S. lactis and S. cremoris) and thermophilic (S. thermophilus) dairy lactic streptococci, which are used in industrial dairy fermentations, contain two different lactose hydrolysing enzymes, a phospho-beta-galactosidase and a beta-galactosidase. The central role of these enzymes in the pathways used for lactose transport and degradation is discussed along with their properties and distributions in lactic streptococci. In addition, recent results on the cloning, expression and sequence organization of the genes for the mesophilic phospho-beta-galactosidase and thermophilic beta-galactosidase are reviewed. Original data are presented concerning heterologous gene expression in the study of lactose hydrolysis in lactic streptococci. These include 1) the purification of the S. lactis phospho-beta-galactosidase from an overproducing Escherichia coli, and 2) the expression of the E. coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene in S. lactis employing a lactic streptococcal expression vector.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria II. Genetics and genetic exchange systems.
AB  
TI  - Construction of a vector plasmid family and its use for molecular cloning in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Cloning vector plasmids have been constructed on the basis of the broad host range plasmid pAM beta 1 and used for the cloning of a nisin resistance determinant in Streptococcus lactis. They incorporate several desirable features for gene cloning in S. lactis and other transformable Gram-positive bacteria. They carry an easily selectable erythromycin resistance marker, are present at low (6-9) or high (45-85) copy number in S. lactis and possess a convenient polyrestriction site sequence. A significant advantage of these plasmids is their capability to carry and stably maintain very large cloned DNA fragments (up to 30 kilobases).
TI  - Characterization of a pAM beta 1 deletion derivative isolated from Lactobacillus  casei after conjugation.
AB  - Streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 was conjugally transferred from Streptococcus lactis KB953 (a transformant of pAM beta 1) into Lactobacillus casei 239. A unique transconjugant, L. casei C2, was found to contain a small (11.1 kilobase pair) plasmid, pLY201, which was derived by a deletion event from pAM beta 1. Restriction analysis revealed that pLY201 was missing approximately 58% of the original pAM beta 1 genome, and contained 5 single restriction sites for AvaI, EcoRI, PvuII, HpaI and KpnI. Physical analyses revealed that the stability and copy number of pLY201 were elevated compared with those of pAM beta 1 in L. casei. In addition, pLY201 was no longer transferable by conjugation.
TI  - Transposition of the Streptococcus lactis ssp. lactis Z270 lactose plasmid to pVA797: demonstration of an insertion sequence and its relationship to an inverted repeat sequence isolated by self-annealing.
AB  - The lactose plasmid pUCL22 of the single plasmid strain Streptococcus lactis ssp. lactis Z270 was demonstrated to fuse with the heterologous conjugative plasmid pVA797. The fusion of pUCL22 with pVA797 occurred by recombination between a specific sequence of pUCL22 and different sites of pVA797. The cointegrates of pUCL22::pVA797 were unstable: in the absence of lactose selection, they segregated plasmids that corresponded to pVA797 enlarged by one sequence of 1.2 kb, common to all derivative plasmids. This resolution sequence (RS) was shown to originate in the 9.7 kb BstEII restriction fragment of pUCL22 and to duplicate during replicon fusion. In addition, after nuclease S1 treatment of pUCL22 DNA, a self-annealing sequence was isolated; the two copies of this inverted repeat (IR) sequence were located on the 18 kb BamHI segment of the plasmid. This latter sequence was distinct from the RS with which it hybridized weakly. The RS was responsible for the transposition of the entire lactose plasmid; the role of the IR remains to be elucidated.
TI  - In vivo gene transfer systems and transposons.
AB  - The continued development of our understanding and application of the in vivo gene transfer systems, transduction and conjugation, and the more recent use of transposons in lactic acid bacteria is reviewed. The discovery of transduction and its use as a tool for genetic analysis is described. The history of the use of conjugation in lactic acid bacteria is outlined, but more detailed discussion is reserved for in-depth analysis of the conjugation system associated with the lactose plasmids of Streptococcus lactis strains ML3 and C2. This system is notable for an unusual cell aggregation phenotype associated with variants of lactose plasmids capable of high frequency transfer and the complex DNA interactions associated with this property. Recent advances in the use of wide host range conjugation systems, such as that of plasmid pAM beta 1 are described, including the mobilisation of vectors by cointegrate formation and subsequent segregation after transfer. The successful exploitation of conjugation for the construction of bacteriophage-resistant starter cultures is highlighted. A description of transposable genetic elements in the lactic acid bacteria, both insertion sequences and transposons, puts emphasis on the elegant analysis of insertion sequence ISL1 in Lactobacillus casei and on the exploitation of the conjugative transposons Tn916 and Tn919. The latter is especially important for providing a technology to initiate analysis of the bacterial chromosome of the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - [Use of the method of protoplast fusion in the selection of a nisin producer].
AB  - Experimental data on selection of Streptococcus lactis producing the polypeptide  antibiotic nisin with the method of protoplast fusing, one of the modern methods of cell engineering are presented. Four strains of Streptococcus lactis differing in their nisin-producing levels and difficult for protoplasting were used in the study. It was shown possible to transfer them to the protoplast form when respective conditions for their preliminary cultivation and regeneration are provided. Distinctive features of these strains with respect to the antibiotic resistance, sugar fermentation and growth component requirements were revealed. The protoplast fusing yielded hybrids differing from the parent strains by a number of phenotypical features and nisin-synthesizing activity.
TI  - N6-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine formation by Streptococcus lactis. Purification, synthesis, and stereochemical structure.
AB  - During growth in an arginine-deficient (chemically defined) medium, cells of Streptococcus lactis K1 formed significant amounts of a previously undetected ninhydrin-positive compound. This intracellular compound did not cochromatograph with any of a wide range of amino acids or amino acid analogs tested. However, by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, the unknown compound migrated close to the recently discovered N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine (Thompson, J., Curtis, M. A., and Miller, S. P. F. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 522-529; Miller, S. P. F., and Thompson, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16109-16115). The purified compound behaved as a neutral amino acid and eluted between valine and methionine in the amino acid analyzer. The results of 1H NMR spectroscopy suggested the presence of a lysine backbone and a coupled methyl-methine unit in the molecule, and 13C NMR showed that there were nine carbon atoms, of which two (C-1 and C-7) were carboxyl carbons. The simplest structure compatible with the physicochemical data was that of an alkylated derivative of lysine. The identity of this new amino acid, N6-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine, was confirmed by chemical synthesis. In vivo labeling experiments conducted using L[U-14C]lysine and [epsilon-15N]lysine showed that exogenous lysine served as the precursor of intracellular N6-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine and that the epsilon-amino N atom was conserved during biosynthesis of the lysine derivative. Of the two possible diastereomers (2S,8S or 2S,8R) of N6-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine, comparative 13C NMR spectroscopy established that the amino acid produced by S. lactis K1 was exclusively of the 2S,8S configuration.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated reduced phage sensitivity in Streptococcus lactis KR5.
AB  - The phage insensitivity of Streptococcus lactis KR5 was evaluated for its possible linkage to plasmid DNA. This strain possessed plasmids of 40, 29, 26, 21, 16.5, 10.5, 7.8, and 1.5 Mdal. Plasmid curing using novobiocin resulted in derivatives with increased sensitivity to prolate-headed phage, suggesting the involvement of plasmid DNA in phage insensitivity. Transformation of S. lactis LM0230 protoplasts with the KR5 plasmid DNA pool produced transformants containing a plasmid of about 27 Mdal. These erythromycin-resistant transformants were lactose-positive phage-sensitive or were lactose-negative and exhibited a reduced sensitivity to phage. Agarose gel electrophoresis and restriction endonuclease digestion analysis showed the 27-Mdal plasmid band to be composed of two distinct plasmids of 26 Mdal (pBF61) and 29 Mdal (pBF62), which coded for reduced phage sensitivity and lactose-positive phenotypes, respectively. The mechanisms of reduced phage sensitivity encoded by pBF61 included a restriction/modification system and a mechanism that resulted in reduced plaque size independent of incubation temperature. These results further support the involvement of plasmid DNA in the mechanisms for reduced phage sensitivity in dairy streptococci.
TI  - Relation of growth of Streptococcus lactis and Streptococcus cremoris to amino acid transport.
AB  - The maximum specific growth rate of Streptococcus lactis and Streptococcus cremoris on synthetic medium containing glutamate but no glutamine decreases rapidly above pH 7. Growth of these organisms is extended to pH values in excess of 8 in the presence of glutamine. These results can be explained by the kinetic properties of glutamate and glutamine transport (B. Poolman, E. J. Smid, and W. N. Konings, J. Bacteriol. 169:2755-2761, 1987). At alkaline pH the rate of growth in the absence of glutamine is limited by the capacity to accumulate glutamate due to the decreased availability of glutamic acid, the transported species of the glutamate-glutamine transport system. Kinetic analysis of leucine and valine transport shows that the maximal rate of uptake of these amino acids by the branched-chain amino acid transport system is 10 times higher in S. lactis cells grown on synthetic medium containing amino acids than in cells grown in complex broth. For cells grown on synthetic medium, the maximal rate of transport exceeds by about 5 times the requirements at maximum specific growth rates for leucine, isoleucine, and valine (on the basis of the amino acid composition of the cell). The maximal rate of phenylalanine uptake by the aromatic amino acid transport system is in small excess of the requirement for this amino acid at maximum specific growth rates. Analysis of the internal amino acid pools of chemostat-grown cells indicates that passive influx of (some) aromatic amino acids may contribute to the net uptake at high dilution rates.
TI  - Intergeneric and intrageneric conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance determinants in Leuconostoc spp.
AB  - Transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 from Streptococcus faecalis to Leuconostoc dextranicum and Leuconostoc cremoris occurred between cells that were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of DNase. Transfer of pIP501 to Leuconostoc spp. also occurred when Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus lactis were used as donors. In addition, transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 was observed from L. cremoris and L. dextranicum transconjugants to S. sanguis and S. faecalis. Expression of the pAM beta 1 erythromycin and pIP501 erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was essentially equivalent in donors and transconjugants. Frequencies of transfer generally ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. Intrageneric transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 occurred between L. cremoris and L. dextranicum strains in the same approximate range. These data further extend the host range of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 and demonstrate another example of gene transfer in the genus Leuconostoc.
TI  - Proteolysis and electrophoretic pattern of casein of some fermented milks.
AB  - Proteolysis and electrophoretic pattern of casein were determined in Friesian cows' skim milk, buffaloes' skim milk and in these milks fermented spontaneously (leben rayeb) and by Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC3 (nonfat buttermilk) or by zabadi starter (zabadi). The highest proteolysis, as evidenced by the amount of released leucine, occurred in zabadi and the lowest in leben rayeb. The highest amount of tyrosine was liberated in the nonfat buttermilk. Proteolysis seems not to depend on the kind of milk used. A band of a relatively high density appeared to be released from alpha s-casein by the cell-wall proteinase of the microflora of raw milk and by heating at 90 degrees C for 1 min. Cows' skim milk, raw or heated, showed the presence of 2 probable proteose-peptone components; buffaloes' skim milk 3 and 2. These components underwent slow or rapid degradation, depending on the type of fermented milk during skim milk coagulation.
TI  - Biological and biochemical characterization of novel lipid-like antibacterial substances (mutalipocins) produced by Streptoccus mutans strain 32K.
AB  - Two novel antibacterial substances (designated mutalipocins) have been isolated from the culture supernatant of Streptoccus mutans strain 32K (serotype c). The mutalipocins were purified by extraction of the culture supernatant with light petroleum (b.p. range 30-60 degrees C), followed by Lobar column chromatography on Lichroprep RP-8. HPLC indicated that both mutalipocin preparations (ML-I and ML-II) were homogeneous. The Mr values of ML-I and ML-II were less than 1000. Both mutalipocins were unaffected by treatment over the pH range 3.0-10.0, or with phospholipase A or proteolytic enzymes, but were partially inactivated by treatment with lipase or phospholipase C. ML-II was resistant to heat treatment. TLC indicated that ML-I and ML-II contained unsaturated, aldehyde and/or ketone, and ester groups. The inhibition of S. mutans by ML-I and ML-II was due to bactericidal, rather than bacteriostatic, activities. The antibacterial spectra of ML-I and ML-II were narrower and more species-specific than those of bacteriocins produced by other Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and structural analysis of the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene from Streptococcus lactis Z268.
AB  - A 4.4-kb XhoI fragment of Streptococcus lactis L13 (Z268) lactose plasmid pUCL13, containing the beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase (P-beta Gal; EC 3.2.1.85)-coding gene has been cloned in Escherichia coli. Further subcloning and deletion of this fragment allowed localization of the P-beta Gal-coding gene (pbg) on a minimal 1.8-kb segment. Expression of P-beta Gal activity was constitutive and was not regulated by glucose in E. coli. The presence of P-beta Gal activity was correlated with the production of a 56.5-kDa protein in E. coli minicells. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene was determined and potential promoter structural elements were identified.
TI  - Amine production by Streptococcus lactis under different growth conditions.
AB  - The highest amount of histamine, tyramine and tryptamine were produced by S. lactis at 30 degrees C in 24 h at pH = 5.0. Maximum amount of different amines was noted in a growth medium lacking NaCl. After addition of NaCl even at 0.5% concentration, slight inhibitory effect on the synthesis of these amines was obtained.
TI  - Regulation of arginine-ornithine exchange and the arginine deiminase pathway in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis metabolizes arginine by the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway. Resting cells of S. lactis grown in the presence of galactose and arginine maintain a high intracellular ornithine pool in the absence of arginine and other exogenous energy sources. Addition of arginine results in a rapid release of ornithine concomitant with the uptake of arginine. Subsequent arginine metabolism results intracellularly in high citrulline and low ornithine pools. Arginine-ornithine exchange was shown to occur in a 1-to-1 ratio and to be independent of a proton motive force. The driving force for arginine uptake in intact cells is supplied by the ornithine and arginine concentration gradients formed during arginine metabolism. These results confirm studies of arginine and ornithine transport in membrane vesicles of S. lactis (A. J. M. Driessen, B. Poolman, R. Kiewiet, and W. N. Konings, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:6093-6097). The activity of the ADI pathway appears to be affected by the internal concentration of (adenine) nucleotides. Conditions which lower ATP consumption (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, high pH) decrease the ADI pathway activity, whereas uncouplers and ionophores which stimulate ATP consumption increase the activity. The arginine-ornithine exchange activity matches the ADI pathway most probably by adjusting the intracellular levels of ornithine and arginine. Regulation of the ADI pathway and the arginine-ornithine exchanger at the level of enzyme synthesis is exerted by glucose (repressor, antagonized by cyclic AMP) and arginine (inducer). An arginine/ornithine antiport was also found in Streptococcus faecalis DS5, Streptococcus sanguis 12, and Streptococcus milleri RH1 type 2.
TI  - Dependence of Streptococcus lactis phosphate transport on internal phosphate concentration and internal pH.
AB  - Uptake of phosphate by Streptococcus lactis ML3 proceeds in the absence of a proton motive force, but requires the synthesis of ATP by either arginine or lactose metabolism. The appearance of free Pi internally in arginine-metabolizing cells corresponded quantitatively with the disappearance of extracellular phosphate. Phosphate transport was essentially unidirectional, and phosphate concentration gradients of up to 10(5) could be established. Substrate specificity studies of the transport system indicated no preference for either mono- or divalent phosphate anion. The activity of the phosphate transport system was affected by the intracellular Pi concentration by a feedback inhibition mechanism. Uncouplers and ionophores which dissipate the pH gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane inhibited phosphate transport at acidic but not at alkaline pH values, indicating that transport activity is regulated by the internal proton concentration. Phosphate uptake driven by arginine metabolism increased with the intracellular pH with a pKa of 7.3. Differences in transport activity with arginine and lactose as energy sources are discussed.
TI  - Control of glycolysis by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in Streptococcus cremoris and Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - The decreased response of the energy metabolism of lactose-starved Streptococcus  cremoris upon readdition of lactose is caused by a decrease of the glycolytic activity (B. Poolman, E. J. Smid, and W. N. Konings, J. Bacteriol. 169:1460-1468, 1987). The decrease in glycolysis is accompanied by a decrease in the activities of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate mutase. The steady-state levels of pathway intermediates upon refeeding with lactose after various periods of starvation indicate that the decreased glycolysis is primarily due to diminished glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, quantification of the control strength exerted by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase on the overall activity of the glycolytic pathway shows that this enzyme can be significantly rate limiting in nongrowing cells.
TI  - Identification of a new insertion element, similar to gram-negative IS26, on the  lactose plasmid of Streptococcus lactis ML3.
AB  - In Streptococcus lactis ML3, the lactose plasmid (pSK08) forms cointegrates with  a conjugal plasmid (pRS01). It has been proposed that cointegration is mediated by insertion sequences (IS) present on pSK08 (D. G. Anderson and L.L. McKay, J. Bacteriol. 158:954-962, 1984). We examined the junction regions of the cointegrate pPW2 and the corresponding regions of pSK08 (donor) and pRS01 (target) and identified a new IS element on pSK08 (ISS1S) which was involved in and duplicated during formation of pPW2. ISS1S was 808 base pairs (bp) in size, had 18-bp inverted repeats (GGTTCTGTTGCAAAGTTT) at its ends, contained a single long open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 226 amino acids, and generated 8-bp direct repeats of target DNA during cointegrate formation. An iso-IS element, ISS1T, which is duplicated in some other cointegrate plasmids, was also found on pSK08. ISS1T was also 808 bp in size and was identical to ISS1S in sequence except for 4 bp, none of which altered the inverted repeats or amino acid sequence of the open reading frame. Comparison of ISS1 with gram-negative IS26 revealed strong homologies in size (820 bp), sequence of inverted repeats (GGCACTGTTGCAAA), size of direct repeats generated after cointegration (8 bp), and number, size, and amino acid sequence (44.5% identical) of the open reading of frame.
TI  - Biosynthesis and stereochemical configuration of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine. An unusual amino acid produced by Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - In a recent communication (Thompson, J., Curtis, M. A., and Miller, S.P.F. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 522-529) we described the purification and characterization of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine from cells of Streptococcus lactis 133. This unusual amino acid has not previously been found in nature. Radiotracer experiments presented here reveal that exogenous [14C]ornithine serves as the precursor for biosynthesis of [14C]arginine, [14C]N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine, and [14C]N5-acetylornithine by cells of S. lactis K1 during growth in a defined medium lacking arginine. In the absence of both arginine and ornithine, cells of S. lactis K1 can also generate intracellular [14C]N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine from exogenous [14C]glutamic acid. Previously we showed that the properties of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine prepared from S. lactis were identical to one of the two diastereomers [2S, 7S) or (2S, 7R] present in a synthetic preparation of (2S, 7RS)-N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine. The two diastereomers have now been unambiguously synthesized by an Abderhalden-Haase condensation between (2S)-N2-t-butoxycarbonyl-ornithine and the chiral (2S)-, and (2R)-bromopropionates. By 13C-NMR spectroscopy it has been established that the preparation from S. lactis is exclusively (2S, 7S)-N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine. has been demonstrated in a cell-free extract of S. lactis 133. The requirements for ornithine, pyruvic acid, and NAD(P)H suggest that biosynthesis of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine occurs via a reductive condensation mechanism. A general survey revealed that N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine was produced only by certain strains of Group N streptococci. These findings may indicate a plasmid locus for the gene(s) encoding the enzyme(s) for N5-(1-carboxyethyl)ornithine biosynthesis.
TI  - Molecular characterization and comparison of 38 virulent and temperate bacteriophages of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Thirty-three virulent and five temperate phages of Streptococcus lactis and Streptococcus cremoris were differentiated into three groups by DNA homology. A complete lack of DNA homology was demonstrated between the phage groups. Within each group, large parts of the phage genomes were homologous except for a few phages. One group consisted of five temperate and two virulent phages suggesting that virulent phages isolated during abnormal fermentations and temperate phages isolated after induction from lactic streptococcal starter cultures may be related to one another. We observed a good correlation between the grouping of phages by DNA homology and by their protein composition since within the same DNA homology group, the protein composition of a phage exhibited some similarities with that of the other phages of the group. Therefore, the DNA homologies seemed to be located, at least, in the region coding for the structural proteins. By immunoblotting, we confirmed the relatedness between the proteins of the phages belonging to the same DNA homology group. The important host range factor in bacterium-phage interactions appeared to be an unreliable criterion in determining phage taxonomy.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pAM beta 1 in Lactobacillus reuteri and between lactobacilli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAM beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred conjugally from Streptococcus lactis to Lactobacillus reuteri, L. murinus, and L. fermentum. Transfer of pAM beta 1 between two L. reuteri strains occurred, and lactobacillus transconjugants could act as donors of pAM beta 1 in crosses with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization as an alternative vector delivery system for lactic streptococci.
AB  - Due to the current variability in applying polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation to lactic streptococci, a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of conjugative mobilization as an alternative method for vector delivery. By using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pVA797, the partially homologous cloning vector pVA838 was successfully introduced into various strains of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis. Frequencies ranged from 10(-2) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Both pVA797 and pVA838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. Also, the shuttle vector pSA3, which shares partial homology with pVA797, was mobilized via conjugation. The use of S. lactis LM2301 as the intermediate donor allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation. The construction of a vector containing a "DNA cassette" conferring mobilization and the resolution, segregation, and stability of the cointegrates, pVA797, pVA838, and pSA3, are also reported.
TI  - Spontaneous release of temperate phage by relysogenized lactose-positive transductants of Streptococcus lactis C2.
AB  - Transduction for lactose-fermenting ability between the lactose-positive lysogen  Streptococcus lactis LM0221 and plasmid-cured, prophage-cured, lactose-negative S. lactis LM2301 resulted in the appearance of lactose-positive transductants surrounded by a zone of clearing in the lactose-negative cell lawn. By using plaque assay procedures, the zones were shown to contain bacteriophage particles, and both spontaneous release and UV induction of prophage from these transductants were demonstrated. The DNA hybridization confirmed that LM2301 did not contain the prophage in its chromosome and that the zone-producing transductant KZ1 was relysogenized by the temperate bacteriophage. Further, a 4.35 Kb EcoRI digestion fragment appeared to contain the DNA sequences for integration into the chromosome and may provide a means for stabilizing cloned DNA by effecting chromosomal insertion in LM2301 derivatives. The selection of zone-producing lactose-positive transductants of LM2301 provided a means for detecting strains relysogenized by the temperate phage induced from LM0221.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis generates a major specific deletion in pAM beta 1.
AB  - pAM beta 1, a 26.5-kilobase plasmid originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis, was conjugally transferred from Streptococcus lactis to Bacillus subtilis. No conjugal transfer of pAM beta 1 from B. subtilis to S. lactis was observed. In addition, pAM beta 1 which had been reintroduced in S. lactis after cycling through B. subtilis had lost its conjugal transferability to Streptococcus cremoris, although under the same conditions noncycled pAM beta 1 was transferred at high efficiency. Restriction and Southern blot analyses showed that pAM beta 1 had suffered one major, specific 10.6-kilobase deletion and several minor but also specific deletions in B. subtilis. Comparing the major deletion derivative, delta pAM beta 1, with B. subtilis strains which have been reported to contain pAM beta 1 showed that these strains also contained delta pAM beta 1. Hybridization experiments showed that the deleted fragment was not transposed to the B. subtilis chromosome. Based on the size of the minor deletion derivatives from pAM beta 1, it is suggested that these use a different origin of replication in B. subtilis.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Streptococcus cremoris Wg2-specific promoters.
AB  - By cloning MboI fragments in the promoter selection vector pGKV210, which replicates in Streptococcus lactis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli and carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, we obtained a number of fragments endowed with promoter activity, partly by direct selection for chloramphenicol resistance in S. lactis IL1403 and partly by selection in B. subtilis. Five fragments were sequenced, and the promoters were mapped with S1 nuclease. The promoters agreed with the E. coli promoter consensus and the B. subtilis vegetative sigma 43 promoter consensus. The promoters were preceded by an A + T-rich region (ranging from 64 to 78% A + T). S1 nuclease mapping data showed that the transcriptional start point in three of the fragments was at a TAG sequence 5 to 9 nucleotides downstream from the promoter. Three fragments carried an open reading frame preceded by a ribosome-binding site which can be recognized by E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. lactis ribosomes.
TI  - [IR spectrophotometric study of a mixed culture of Streptococcus lactis, strain MSU, and Rhodotorula colostri with agitation of the medium].
AB  - Physiological aspects of Streptococcus lactis, strain MSU development in mixed culture with Rhodotorula colostri were studied in connection with nisin biosynthesis. By the IR spectra the average content of the main components in the monoculture cells of S. lactis and its association with the yeast in the stationary growth phase was the following by dry weight: 54-58 per cent of protein, 14-16 per cent of nucleic acids, 26-28 per cent of carbohydrates and 3-5 per cent of lipids. Glucose and nitrogen in the fermentation broth were consumed completely. A significant quantity of KH2PO4 remained in the fermentation broth. Lactic acid excretion was observed. S. lactis, strain MSU was the leading component of the association under the studied cultivation conditions because just its IR spectra dominated in the spectra of the mixed culture.
TI  - Ornithine transport and exchange in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Resting cells of Streptococcus lactis 133 appeared to accumulate [14C]ornithine to a high concentration in the absence of an exogenous energy source. However, analysis of intracellular amino acid pool constituents and results of transport experiments revealed that the accumulation of ornithine represented a homoexchange between extracellular [14C]ornithine and unlabeled ornithine in the cell. The energy-independent exchange of ornithine was not inhibited by proton-conducting uncouplers or by metabolic inhibitors. Intracellular [14C]ornithine was retained by resting cells after suspension in a buffered medium. However, addition of unlabeled ornithine to the suspension elicited rapid exit of labeled amino acid. The initial rate of exit of [14C]ornithine was dependent on the concentration of unlabeled ornithine in the medium, but this accelerative exchange diffusion process caused no net loss of amino acid. By contrast, the presence of a fermentable energy source caused a rapid expulsion of and net decrease in the concentration of intracellular ornithine. Kinetic analyses of amino acid transport demonstrated competitive inhibition between lysine and ornithine, and data obtained by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography established the heteroexchange of these basic amino acids. The effects of amino acids and of ornithine analogs on both entry and exit of [14C]ornithine have been examined. The data suggest that a common carrier mediates the entry and exchange of lysine, arginine, and ornithine in cells of S. lactis.
TI  - Arginine transport in Streptococcus lactis is catalyzed by a cationic exchanger.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis metabolizes arginine via the arginine deiminase pathway to ornithine, CO2, NH3, and ATP. The translocation of arginine and ornithine has been studied using membrane vesicles of galactose/arginine-grown cells of S. lactis fused with cytochrome c oxidase proteoliposomes by the freeze/thaw--sonication procedure earlier described. In the presence of reduced cytochrome c the fused membranes rapidly accumulate ornithine. Addition of arginine releases accumulated ornithine. Rapid uncoupler-insensitive exchange between external arginine and internal ornithine is seen at rates that are at least 60-fold higher than the rate of protonmotive force-driven arginine translocation. This arginine:ornithine exchange activity was reconstituted in proteoliposomes after solubilization of S. lactis membranes with octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. These proteoliposomes catalyze a one-to-one exchange between arginine and ornithine. The arginine:ornithine exchange system is the first exchange system for cationic metabolites found in bacteria. Translocation of arginine via this system does not require metabolic energy obtained by arginine metabolism.
TI  - A method for genetic transformation of nonprotoplasted Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Plasmid transformation of whole cells of Streptococcus lactis LM0230 was demonstrated. The procedure required polyethylene glycol and incubation in hypertonic media, but did not require enzymatic cell wall digestion. Conditions were optimized, yielding 5 X 10(5) transformants per micrograms of pSA3 DNA. Variables tested for effect on transformation efficiency included molecular weight, concentration, and pH of polyethylene glycol; cell density; plating media; DNA concentration; heat shock; and incubation of cells in hypertonic buffer. DNAs transformed included pSA3, pVA856, pTV1, and c2 phi. Transformation from DNA-DNA ligation mixes, with DNA not purified through density gradients, and with previously frozen cells was also achieved. The method described here for transformation of nonprotoplasted cells of LM0230 is unique, and to date has not been applied successfully to other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Calcium alginate-immobilized cultures of lactic Streptococci are protected from bacteriophages.
AB  - Calcium alginate-immobilized cultures of lactic streptococci were grown in milk and assessed for their sensitivity to homologous bacteriophage, proteolytic activity, and acid production. Immobilized cultures of Streptococcus lactis C2 and Streptococcus cremoris HP were protected from attack by bacteriophage due to the exclusion of phage particles from the gel matrix. These cultures were also functionally proteinase-deficient when immobilized in calcium alginate beads and grown in milk. Acid was produced by immobilized cultures at a lower rate than cells freely suspended in milk due in part to the inability of the immobilized cells to hydrolyze milk proteins. Agitation of immobilized cultures slightly increased acid production, suggesting that diffusional limitations of substrate into the beads contributed to decreased acid production. Use of immobilized cultures of lactic streptococci in certain dairy fermentations may be advantageous due to the protection of these cultures from attack by virulent bacteriophage.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a cell wall proteinase from Streptococcus lactis NCDO 763.
AB  - A proteinase was purified from a cell wall extract of a culture of Streptococcus  lactis NCDO 763 grown in skim milk. Being active at a low pH (at pH 4.8 on haemoglobin and pH 6.0-6.5 on casein) and completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, it was considered to be a serine proteinase partly inhibited by EDTA; the mol. wt was approximately 80,000.
TI  - Regulation of the glutamate-glutamine transport system by intracellular pH in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Various methods of manipulation of the intracellular pH in Streptococcus lactis result in a unique relationship between the rate of glutamate and glutamine transport and the cytoplasmic pH. The initial rate of glutamate uptake by S. lactis cells increases more than 30-fold when the intracellular pH is raised from 6.0 to 7.4. A further increase of the cytoplasmic pH to 8.0 was without effect on transport. The different levels of inhibition of glutamate and glutamine transport at various external pH values by uncouplers and ionophores, which dissipate the proton motive force, can be explained by the effects exerted on the intracellular pH. The dependence of glutamate transport on the accumulation of potassium ions in potassium-filled and -depleted cells is caused by the regulation of intracellular pH by potassium movement.
TI  - Restriction enzyme analysis of lactose and bacteriocin plasmids from Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis WM4 and cloning of BclI fragments coding for bacteriocin production.
AB  - The 131.1-kilobase (kb) bacteriocin production (Bac) plasmid pNP2 and the 63.6-kb lactose metabolism (Lac) plasmid pCS26, from Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis WM4, as well as pWN8, a 116.7-kb recombinant plasmid from a Lac+ transconjugant, were analyzed with restriction enzymes to determine the origin of pWN8. Plasmid pWN8 conferred a Lac+ Bac- phenotype, contained DNA derived from pCS26 and pNP2, and, like pNP2, exhibited self-transmissibility (Tra+). In cloning attempts, Bac+ transformant S. lactis KSH1 was isolated. The recombinant plasmid, pKSH1, contained three BclI fragments from pNP2. Bac- transformants which individually contained each of the three fragments were also identified. Comparison of restriction maps of pKSH1 and pNP2 revealed an 18.4-kb region common to both plasmids, involving two of the three BclI fragments. S. lactis KSH1 also exhibited greater inhibitory activity against the indicator strain S. diacetylactis 18-16 than did a strain containing the 131.1-kb Bac plasmid.
TI  - Phage resistance in Streptococcus lactis ssp. diacetylactis transconjugant SLA3.2501 and its derivatives.
AB  - Phage 18-16, which was virulent for Streptococcus lactis ssp. diacetylactis SLA3.25 was used to study phage-resistant characteristics of mucoid S. lactis ssp. diacetylactis transconjugant SLA3.2501 obtained through conjugative cotransfer of pSRQ2201 (Lac-plasmid) and pSRQ2202 (Muc-plasmid) to SLA3.25 (15). Interaction of phage 18-16 with SLA3.2501 and its derivatives showed that phage resistance was not related to either the lack of phage adsorption or restriction-modification. Suppression of phage replication in SLA3.2501 and its derivatives was not completely relieved by curing of either pSRQ2201 or pSRQ2202 or both.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of nisin plasmid genes from Streptococcus lactis 7962 to Leuconostoc dextranicum 181.
AB  - Acriflavine-generated mutants of Streptococcus lactis 7962 with various combinations of plasmid molecular masses were screened for nisin production. Nisin was produced by both the wild type and mutants that contained a 17.5-megadalton plasmid, which was obscured by chromosomal fragments. No nisin was produced by plasmid-free mutants. Sucrose fermentation and nisin production were simultaneously expressed. A transconjugant obtained from nisin-producing donor S. lactis 7962 and recipient Leuconostoc dextranicum 181 was a "supernisin" producer. The L. dextranicum Nis+ transconjugant was resistant to S. lactis 7962 phage and vancomycin (greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml), and it contained an extra 17.5-megadalton plasmid.

TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - Reconstitution of ATP-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  - Membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus lactis, and Streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-D-glucoside in the presence of Escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. For reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated E. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-D-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. ATP-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was comparable to that found in parent vesicles. Recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. The properties of ATP-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. In proteoliposomes, ATP-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the F0F1-ATPase. On the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microM vanadate, for S. faecalis, S. lactis, and S. sanguis, respectively. This marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an E1E2-type ion-motive pump. These data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an ATP-dependent proton circulation via the F0F1-ATPase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating ATPase. Thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an ATP-linked process analogous to the ion-motive ATPases of eukaryotic membranes.
TI  - [Nisin biosynthesis during the joint cultivation of Streptococcus lactis strain MGU and yeasts].
AB  - In simultaneous inoculation of the medium for nisin biosynthesis with Streptococcus lactis (strain MSU) and yeasts such as Rhodotorula colostri, Zigowilliopsis californicus, Hansenuia anomala, Saccharomyces ludvigii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Endomyces magnusi the quantitative ratio of the inoculates in the mixed cultures is not in principle important for the antibiotic synthesis by the Streptococcus. When 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-hour inoculates of the yeasts were added simultaneously to 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 18-hour cultures of S. lactis biosynthesis of nisin was at the control level. The fractional composition of the fermentation broth of the above yeast species had no significant effect on biosynthesis of nisin.
TI  - Bacterial anion exchange. Use of osmolytes during solubilization and reconstitution of phosphate-linked antiport from Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Membranes of Streptococcus lactis were solubilized with 1.1% octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of 0.37% acetone/ether-washed phospholipid from several sources. After adding excess Escherichia coli phospholipid as bath-sonicated liposomes, phosphate:sugar phosphate antiport was reconstituted in proteoliposomes by a 25-fold dilution in 0.1 M KPi (pH 7). Assays of 32Pi:Pi exchange showed that antiport was subject to an inactivation which varied in severity according to the lipid present at solubilization. Recovery of Pi-linked exchange was improved by the presence of 10-20% glycerol or other osmolyte during extraction. The osmolytes tested in this regard have included polyols (glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol), sugars (glucose, trehalose), and two amino acids (glycine, proline). Each gave 10--20-fold increased recoveries of 32Pi:Pi antiport compared to controls using only detergent and lipid; these precautions were not required for the efficient reconstitution of F0F1-ATPase. Antiport in the artificial system was studied most carefully when glycerol was the stabilizing additive. For that case, the Kt values for Pi or 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (275 and 25 microM, respectively) were the same as in native membranes. Maximal rates of Pi and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (200 and 42 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) and the turnover number for Pi exchange (25--50/s) suggested that antiporters were recovered without loss of activity. We conclude that the quantitative aspects of bacterial anion exchange are amenable to study in an artificial system, and that the use of osmolytes as general stabilants can be a valuable adjunct to current techniques for reconstitution of integral membrane transport proteins.
TI  - Resistance of Streptococcus lactis mutants to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentrations of penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics were determined for Streptococcus lactis in milk and trypteine soy broth. The values were always higher in milk than in broth. Minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin was higher in solid than in liquid media. Two mutants resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics were obtained, and their growth rate, proteolysis, and acidification patterns determined. Tolerance toward these antibiotics was found when the mutants were grown in milk but not when they were grown in broth.
TI  - High-efficiency transformation of Streptococcus lactis protoplasts by plasmid DNA.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis IL1403 protoplasts were transformed by plasmid pIL204 (5.5 kilobases), which conferred erythromycin resistance with an average efficiency of 5 X 10(6) transformants per microgram of supercoiled DNA. The procedure used and transformation efficiencies obtained were close to those described for Bacillus subtilis (G. Chang and S. N. Cohen, Mol. Gen. Genet. 168:111-115, 1979).
TI  - Development of high-level streptomycin resistance affected by a plasmid in lactic streptococci.
AB  - Some lactose-negative (Lac-) mutants of Streptococcus lactis C2 and ML3 exhibited development of very high level streptomycin resistance after incubation with subinhibitory concentrations of the drug for 18 to 22 h. These drug-resistant mutants showed no loss of resistance even after 6 months of subculturing in broth without any drug. The parental Lac+ strains did not show mutation to high-level streptomycin resistance. The Lac+ characteristic of the parental strain was conjugally transferred to Lac- derivatives of C2 and ML3, showing the ability to mutate to high-level resistance. When transconjugants were analyzed for this characteristic, they showed both mutable and nonmutable Lac+ types. The results suggested that genetic information for mutation to high-level streptomycin resistance in lactic streptococci resides on the chromosome, and its expression is affected by a plasmid. The plasmid profiles of strains C2, ML3, C2 Lac-, ML3 Lac-, and two kinds of transconjugants confirmed the presence of a plasmid of approximately 5.5 megadaltons in strains showing no mutation to high-level streptomycin resistance, while strains missing such a plasmid exhibited high-level streptomycin resistance after incubation with subinhibitory concentrations of the drug.
TI  - N5-(1-carboxyethyl)-ornithine, a new amino acid from the intracellular pool of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Intracellular concentrations of amino acids were determined in cells of Streptococcus lactis 133 during growth in complex, spent, and chemically defined media. Glutamic and aspartic acids represented the major constituents of the amino acid pool. However, organisms grown in spent medium or in defined medium supplemented with ornithine also contained unusually high levels of two additional amino acids. One of these amino acids was ornithine. The second compound exhibited properties of a neutral amino acid by coelution with valine from the amino acid analyzer. The compound did not, however, comigrate with valine or any other standard amino acid by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. The unknown amino acid was purified by paper and thin-layer chromatography, and its molecular structure was determined by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This new amino acid was shown to be N5-(1-carboxyethyl)-ornithine. The 14C-labeled compound was formed by cells of S. lactis 133 during growth in spent medium or defined medium containing [14C]ornithine. Formation of the derivative by resting cells required ornithine and the presence of a metabolizable sugar. N5-(1-Carboxyethyl)-ornithine was synthesized chemically from both poly-S-ornithine and (2S)-N2-carbobenzyloxy-ornithine as a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers. The physical and chemical properties of the amino acid purified from S. lactis 133 were identical to those of one of the synthetic diastereomers. The bis-N-trifluoroacetyl-di-n-butyl esters of the natural and synthetic compounds generated identical gas chromatography-mass spectrometry spectra. A mechanism is suggested for the in vivo synthesis of N5-(1-carboxyethyl)-ornithine, and the possible functions of this new amino acid are discussed.
TI  - [3-component nutrient medium for the nisin producer Streptococcus lactis strain MGU].
AB  - The methods of mathematical desing of experiments such as Box and full factorial  design were used in the study. As a result a three-component medium including 1-2 per cent of mollases, 10-20 mg% of yeast autolysate and 1-2 per cent of KH2PO4 was recommended for biosynthesis of nisin.
TI  - Cloning, expression and location of the Streptococcus lactis gene for phospho-beta-D-galactosidase.
AB  - Genes for lactose catabolism and proteinase production in Streptococcus lactis 712 are encoded by a 56.5 kb metabolic plasmid, pLP712. A lactose mini-plasmid of only 23.7 kb, pMG820, was constructed by introducing two deletions into pLP712, and was cloned as two segments of DNA into the Escherichia coli vector pAT153 using restriction endonuclease PstI. The lactose genetic region of pLP712, which has been defined by deletion and restriction mapping, was cut into two parts by this process. When the smaller 10.8 kb segment of pMG820 DNA was present, the key lactic streptococcal lactose splitting enzyme, phospho-beta-D-galactosidase, was expressed in E. coli. The gene for phospho-beta-D-galactosidase was more precisely located by introducing a series of deletions into cloned DNA by in vitro manipulations and then assaying for enzyme activity. The presence of this phospho-beta-D-galactosidase activity was correlated with the production of a 58 kDa 35S-labelled protein both by E. coli minicells and after coupled transcription and translation of cloned DNA. The product of a second gene, a 37 kDa protein ('protein X'), and a possible truncated phospho-beta-D-galactosidase protein of 16 kDa were also detected in minicells.
TI  - Cloning in Streptococcus lactis of plasmid-mediated UV resistance and effect on prophage stability.
AB  - Plasmid pIL7 (33 kilobases) from Streptococcus lactis enhances UV resistance and  prophage stability. A 5.4-kilobase pIL7 fragment carrying genes coding for both characters was cloned into S. lactis, using plasmid pHV1301 as the cloning vector. The recombinant plasmid was subsequently transferred to three other S. lactis strains by transformation or protoplast fusion. Cloned genes were expressed in all tested strains.

TI  - Partial characterization of the genetic basis for sucrose metabolism and nisin production in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - We attempted to identify the genetic loci for sucrose-fermenting ability (Suc+),  nisin-producing ability (Nip+), and nisin resistance (Nisr) in certain strains of Streptococcus lactis. To obtain genetic evidence linking the Suc+ Nip+ Nisr phenotype to a distinct plasmid, both conjugal transfer and transformation were attempted. A conjugation procedure modified to protect the recipients against the inhibitory action of nisin allowed the conjugal transfer of the Suc+ Nip+ Nisr marker from three Suc+ Nip+ Nisr donors to various recipients. The frequency of transfer ranged from 1.7 x 10(-4) to 5.6 x 10(-8) per input donor, depending on the mating pair. However, no additional plasmid DNA was apparent in these transconjugants. Transformation of S. lactis LM0230 to the Suc+ Nip+ Nisr phenotype by using the plasmid pool of S. lactis ATCC 11454 was not achieved, even though other plasmids present in the pool were successfully transferred. However, two results imply the involvement of plasmid DNA in coding for the Suc+ Nip+ Nisr phenotype. The Suc+ Nip+ Nisr marker was capable of conjugal transfer to a recipient deficient in host-mediated homologous recombination (Rec-), and the Suc+ Nip+ Nisr marker exhibited bilateral plasmid incompatibility with a number of lactose plasmids found in S. lactis. Although our results indicate that the Suc+ Nip+ Nisr phenotype is plasmid encoded, no physical evidence linking this phenotype to a distinct plasmid was obtained.
TI  - Variable stoichiometry of phosphate-linked anion exchange in Streptococcus lactis: implications for the mechanism of sugar phosphate transport by bacteria.
AB  - Phosphate/2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate antiport in Streptococcus lactis showed an exchange stoichiometry that varied over a 2-fold range when assay pH was shifted between pH 8.2 and pH 5.2. At pH 7.0 and above, 2 mol of phosphate moved per mol of sugar phosphate; at pH 6.1 the ratio was 1.5:1, while at pH 5.2 the overall stoichiometry fell to 1.1:1. This pattern was not affected by valinomycin in potassium-based media, nor could variable stoichiometry be attributed to altered hydrolysis of the sugar phosphate substrate. In kinetic studies at pH 7.0 or pH 5.2, sugar 6-phosphate was a competitive inhibitor of phosphate transport, indicating operation of a single system. Parallel tests showed that the affinity of antiport for its sugar 6-phosphate substrate was insensitive to pH in this range. Overall, such results suggest a neutral exchange that has specificity for monovalent phosphate but that selects randomly among the available mono- and divalent sugar 6-phosphates. A simple model that shows this behavior suggests a mechanistic role for anion exchange in bacterial transport of sugar phosphate or other organic anions.
TI  - Covalent modification of citrate lyase ligase from Clostridium sphenoides by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.
AB  - Citrate lyase ligase was shown to be present in Clostridium sphenoides actively degrading citrate. In contrast to citrate lyase ligase from C. sporosphaeroides and Streptococcus lactis, the enzyme from C. sphenoides was under stringent regulatory control. The alteration of the kinetic properties of the enzyme after depletion of citrate suggested the presence of two different enzyme species in different phases of growth: active and partially active citrate lyase ligase. These enzymes were purified from in vivo 32P-labeled C. sphenoides cells, which were grown on low-phosphate medium containing 40 mM citrate and 1 mCi [32]orthophosphate. During enzyme purification only the active form of citrate lyase ligase was shown to be radioactively labeled. Growth experiments with 14C-labeled precursors of purines and pyrimidines and subsequent purification of active citrate lyase ligase indicated that the 32P labeling of the enzyme was not due to the incorporation of a nucleotide. Inactivation of the ligase after its treatment with acid phosphatase also suggested that the active form of the enzyme is phosphorylated. Citrate lyase ligase, therefore, is the first known enzyme in an anaerobic bacterium whose activity is modulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.
TI  - Characterization of streptococcal bacteriophage c6A.
AB  - Bacteriophage c6A is a lytic phage that infects strains of Streptococcus lactis.  Infection of S. lactis C6 under standard conditions yielded 124 +/- 8 p.f.u. per infected cell after a latent period of 25 min at 30 degrees C. The virion of c6A was shown to contain at least 12 polypeptides and a 21.9 kilobase double-stranded, linear DNA genome with complementary 5'-protruding single-stranded termini. The (G + C) content of this DNA was estimated to be 36.7%. A restriction map was constructed which indicates that a number of restriction endonucleases did not digest the DNA and that others cleaved with a much lower frequency than expected.
TI  - Effect of Ca2+ ions on plasmid transformation of Streptococcus lactis protoplasts.
AB  - The effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions on the efficiency of the plasmid transformation of lysozyme-treated Streptococcus lactis protoplasts were compared. A 33-megadalton plasmid, pLP712, coding for lactose fermentation and a 6.5-megadalton plasmid, pGB301, coding for erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance were used as model plasmids, and S. lactis MG1614 was the recipient. Replacing Mg2+ with Ca2+ in the transformation buffer was found to increase transformant frequency more than 10-fold with both plasmids.
TI  - [Amino acid composition and biological value of koumiss leaven].
AB  - To study the biological value of kumyss leaven, experiments were made with mono-cultures contained by kumyss leaven. The cultures Streptococcus lactis, strain 1-27, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, strain B-3, acetic acid bacteria and the yeast culture Torulopsis kefir var kumis, strain 17 contained by kumyss leaven were employed as test objects. Experiments were performed with defattened cow's milk. The following parameters were measured: acidity according to Turner (T degree), dry residue, total nitrogen according to Kjeldahl's micromethod, amino acid composition by ion-exchange chromatography, biological value according to the amino acid score. All the parameters were studied over time for 5 days. The vital activity of the cultures produced different effects on the acidity, dry residue and amino acid composition, therefore on the biological value of kumyss leavens. It is assumed that the data obtained may be of importance for kumyss manufacture.
TI  - Construction of cloning, promoter-screening, and terminator-screening shuttle vectors for Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Shuttle vectors have been constructed which are suitable both for the selection of regulatory sequences and for gene cloning in Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus lactis. The promoter screening vectors contain a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene; the insertion of suitable DNA fragments upstream of the gene restored the enzyme activity. With a related set of vectors, transcription termination signals can be selected.
TI  - The cytochrome c oxidase test for the rapid detection of psychrotrophic bacteria  in milk.
AB  - A new, rapid, simple and cheap method for the detection of the predominant psychrotrophic bacteria in raw and pasteurized milks is described, using tetramethyl-p-phenylene-diamine dihydrochloride to detect cytochrome c oxidase which in general is not present in the non-psychrotrophic bacterial milk flora. The test is sensitive to samples containing over 10(4) organisms/ml. Correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.84 between dye oxidation and viable counts for pasteurized and raw milk samples, respectively, were found.
TI  - Secretory and serum antibodies against Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus in relation to ingestion of fermented milk products.
AB  - Serum, saliva, and urine were analyzed for the presence of IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies reactive with the yoghurt bacteria Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. A comparison was made between four subjects who frequently ate yoghurt and four subjects who never ate yoghurt. Salivary IgA and serum IgG activity against the milk-fermenting bacterium S. lactis was studied in five other subjects before, during, and after a period of ingestion of a fermented milk product, filmjolk. All analyses were carried out by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Antibody activity against the yoghurt bacteria was found in saliva, serum, and urine. No difference in antibody activity between yoghurt eaters and non-yoghurt eaters was measured for salivary IgA, but for serum IgG a lower activity against S. thermophilus was present among the yoghurt eaters. Antibody activity against S. lactis was present already before the ingestion of filmjolk began, and the activity was not altered during the period of ingestion. It is concluded that in adult subjects, the ingestion of milk-fermenting bacteria does not result in a significant change in the antibody activity against these bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Streptococcus cremoris proteinase in Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Previously, curing experiments suggested that plasmid pWV05 (17.5 megadaltons [Md]) of Streptococcus cremoris Wg2 specifies proteolytic activity. A restriction enzyme map of pWV05 was constructed, the entire plasmid was subcloned in Escherichia coli with plasmids pBR329 and pACYC184. A 4.3-Md HindIII fragment could not be cloned in an uninterrupted way in E. coli but could be cloned in two parts. Both fragments showed homology with the 9-Md proteinase plasmid of S. cremoris HP. The 4.3-Md HindIII fragment was successfully cloned in Bacillus subtilis on plasmid pGKV2 (3.1 Md). Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of extracts of B. subtilis carrying the recombinant plasmid (pGKV500; 7.4 Md) showed that the fragment specifies two proteins of the proteolytic system of S. cremoris Wg2. PGKV500 was introduced in a proteinase-deficient Streptococcus lactis strain via protoplast transformation. Both proteins were also present in cell-free extracts of S. lactis(pGKV500). In S. lactis, pGKV500 enables the cells to grow normally in milk with rapid acid production, indicating that the 4.3-Md HindIII fragment of plasmid pWV05 specifies the proteolytic activity of S. cremoris Wg2.
TI  - Reconstitution of phosphate-linked antiport from Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Membrane protein solubilized by octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of dispersed phospholipid was incubated with bath-sonicated liposomes and additional detergent. The proteoliposomes formed on dilution showed transport and exchange properties consistent with a reconstitution of phosphate:sugar 6-phosphate antiport. Thus, phosphate self-exchange was found only when protein from induced cells was used; this exchange was blocked by a sugar 6-phosphate, not by a sugar 1-phosphate; and proteoliposomes supported an accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate with no added source of energy. Solubilization and reconstitution of protein was most effective when performed in the presence of gram-positive phospholipids.
TI  - Conjugal transfer from Streptococcus lactis ME2 of plasmids encoding phage resistance, nisin resistance and lactose-fermenting ability: evidence for a high-frequency conjugative plasmid responsible for abortive infection of virulent bacteriophage.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis ME2 exhibits at least three mechanisms which confer resistance to virulent bacteriophage. These include plasmid-induced interference with phage adsorption, host-controlled restriction and modification activities, and a heat-sensitive mechanism which suppresses development of virulent phage. Conjugal mating experiments were done with S. lactis ME2 to determine if phage-defence mechanisms present in this strain could be mobilized, associated with plasmid DNA elements and phenotypically characterized in transconjugants. Agar-surface matings of S. lactis ME2 with S. lactis LM0230 demonstrated that lactose-fermenting ability (Lac+) was transferred in a conjugation-like process at frequencies of 10(-6) per donor cell and was associated with a 40 MDal plasmid designated pTR1040. Resistance to nisin (Nisr) was acquired or lost simultaneously with Lac+, indicating that pTR1040 carried determinants for both phenotypes. Lac+ Nisr transconjugants that carried a 30 MDal plasmid (pTR2030) exhibited a heat-sensitive phage-defence mechanism (Hsp+) which limited the burst size and plaque size of phage c2 without altering the efficiency of plaquing (e.o.p.) or the level of adsorption. The ability of phage c2 to initiate plaquing at an e.o.p. of 1.0 indicated that DNA injection and early viral gene expression are not affected in the Hsp+ transconjugants. We suggest, therefore, that the Hsp+ phenotype may result from plasmid-induced abortive infection of phage dependent on the presence of pTR2030. Hsp+ transconjugants carrying pTR2030 also promoted high-frequency conjugal transfer of Lac+ Nisr associated with pTR1040 (greater than 10(-1) per donor cell). It was concluded that Hsp+ and determinants for conjugal transfer ability (Tra+) are located on pTR2030.
TI  - Comparative peptide specificity of cell wall, membrane and intracellular peptidases of group N streptococci.
AB  - Solubilized cell walls of group N streptococci contain two electrophoretically distinct peptidases, one of which hydrolysed trileucine only, while the second hydrolysed a wide range of di- and tripeptides. Neither enzyme possessed leucine aminopeptidase or endopeptidase activity. Four and three peptidases, respectively, were separated in intracellular extracts of Streptococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Strep. lactis subsp. cremoris produced by osmotic lysis of spheroplasts. In contrast with the cell-wall extracts, two of the peptidases had broad specificites, though only one of these hydrolysed trileucine. Purified membranes of Strep. lactis subsp. lactis contained only one electrophoretically distinct peptidase of very narrow specificity. There were small differences between the numbers of peptides hydrolysed by cell wall preparations from milk-grown or broth-grown cells.
TI  - Intracellular phosphorylation of glucose analogs via the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose-phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar-phosphotransferase system (PTS) mediates  the vectorial translocation and concomitant phosphorylation of sugars. The question arises of whether the PTS can also mediate the phosphorylation of intracellular sugars. To investigate this possibility in Streptococcus lactis 133, lactose derivatives have been prepared containing 14C-labeled 2-deoxy-glucose (2DG), 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (2FG), or alpha-methylglucoside as the aglycon substituent of the disaccharide. Two of the compounds, beta-O-D-galactopyranosyl-(1,4')-2'-deoxy-D-glucopyranose (2'D-lactose) and beta-O-D-galactopyranosyl-(1,4')-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-D-glucopyranose (2'F-lactose), were high-affinity substrates of the lactose-PTS. After translocation, the radiolabeled 2'F-lactose 6-phosphate (2'F-lactose-6P) and 2'D-lactose-6P derivatives were hydrolyzed by P-beta-galactoside-galactohydrolase to galactose-6P and either [14C]2FG or [14C]2DG, respectively. Thereafter, the glucose analogs appeared in the medium, but the rates of sugar exit from mannose-PTS-defective mutants were greater than those determined in the parent strain. Unexpectedly, the results of kinetic studies and quantitative analyses of intracellular products in S. lactis 133 showed that initially (and before exit) the glucose analogs existed primarily in phosphorylated form. Furthermore, the production of intracellular [14C]2FG-6P and [14C]2DG-6P (during uptake of the lactose analogs) continued when the possibility for reentry of [14C]2FG and 2DG was precluded by addition of mannose-PTS inhibitors (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylmannosamine) to the medium. By contrast, (i) only [14C]2DG, [14C]2FG, and trace amounts of [14C]2FG-6P were found in cells of a mannose-PTS-defective mutant, and (ii) only [14C]2FG and [14C]2DG were present in cells of a double mutant lacking both mannose-PTS and glucokinase activities. We conclude from these data that the mannose-PTS can effect the intracellular phosphorylation of glucose and its analogs in S. lactis 133.
TI  - Lactose metabolism in Streptococcus lactis: studies with a mutant lacking glucokinase and mannose-phosphotransferase activities.
AB  - A mutant of Streptococcus lactis 133 has been isolated that lacks both glucokinase and phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent mannose-phosphotransferase (mannose-PTS) activities. The double mutant S. lactis 133 mannose-PTSd GK- is unable to utilize either exogenously supplied or intracellularly generated glucose for growth. Fluorographic analyses of metabolites formed during the metabolism of [14C]lactose labeled specifically in the glucose or galactosyl moiety established that the cells were unable to phosphorylate intracellular glucose. However, cells of S. lactis 133 mannose-PTSd GK- readily metabolized intracellular glucose 6-phosphate, and the growth rates and cell yield of the mutant and parental strains on sucrose were the same. During growth on lactose, S. lactis 133 mannose-PTSd GK- fermented only the galactose moiety of the disaccharide, and 1 mol of glucose was generated per mol of lactose consumed. For an equivalent concentration of lactose, the cell yield of the mutant was 50% that of the wild type. The specific rate of lactose utilization by growing cells of S. lactis 133 mannose-PTSd GK- was ca. 50% greater than that of the wild type, but the cell doubling times were 70 and 47 min, respectively. High-resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies of lactose transport by starved cells of S. lactis 133 and S. lactis 133 mannose-PTSd GK- showed that the latter cells contained elevated lactose-PTS activity. Throughout exponential growth on lactose, the mutant maintained an intracellular steady-state glucose concentration of 100 mM. We conclude from our data that phosphorylation of glucose by S. lactis 133 can be mediated by only two mechanisms: (i) via ATP-dependent glucokinase, and (ii) by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent mannose-PTS system.
TI  - Mechanism of action of lactostrepcin 5, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus cremoris 202.
AB  - The mechanism of bactericidal activity of lactostrepcin 5 (Las 5), a bacteriocin  produced by Streptococcus cremoris 202, was investigated. Las 5 did not kill protoplasts of sensitive cells, and its activity was decreased about 10-fold after pretreatment of the cells with trypsin, suggesting the involvement of the cell wall in the activity of this bacteriocin. In susceptible cells, the bacteriocin slowed down and then stopped synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein, although this did not appear to be the primary effect of Las 5 action. Las 5 also inhibited uridine transport in susceptible cells and induced leakage of K+ ions and ATP. Survival of cells treated with Las 5 in phosphate buffer was higher in the presence of K+, CA2+, or Mg2+ ions.
TI  - Survey of antimicrobial resistance in lactic streptococci.
AB  - A total of 26 strains of Streptococcus cremoris and 12 strains of Streptococcus lactis were challenged with 18 antimicrobial agents and with nisin in the Bauer-Kirby disk susceptibility test. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, erythromycin, penicillin G, tetracycline, and vancomycin. All strains were resistant to trimethoprim, and almost all strains were resistant to sulfathiazole. Variability in resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, lincomycin, nafcillin, neomycin, nisin, rifampin, and streptomycin was observed. MICs of these substances for the less susceptible strains were determined, and high-level resistance factors could not be detected, except in the case of nisin. S. lactis ATCC 7962 was resistant to at least 40-fold-higher concentrations of nisin (greater than 64 micrograms/ml) than most other strains tested. This strain was a potent nisin producer.
TI  - The phylogenetic position of Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, S. equinus, S. bovis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S. lactis, S. raffinolactis and Enterococcus faecalis have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16S ribosomal RNA. All the organisms form a loose but coherent group that is phylogenetically equivalent to those of lactobacilli, bacilli, the Brochothrix and Listeria group, and related taxa that constitute one of several sublines within the 'Clostridium' branch of Gram-positive eubacteria. Within the Steptococcus-Enterococcus group, organisms fall into three moderately related clusters defined by Enterococcus, the lactic acid streptococci and streptococci of the pyogenic and oral groups, respectively.
TI  - [Joint cultivation of Streptococcus lactis, LMU strain, and various species of yeasts].
AB  - When S. lactis, strain LMU and yeast were plated out simultaneously on media containing different amounts of amine nitrogen and vitamins, the yeast did not stimulate the synthesis of nisin. Plating out of S. lactis on media with grown cultures of the Rostov baker's yeast, American baker's yeast, Candida guilliermondii, Candida clausenii, Fabospora fragilis, Fabospora macedoniensis, Octosporomyces octosporus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, races "Ya" and "M" and Saccharomyces globosus resulted in inhibition of the S. lactis growth and nisin synthesis. Cultivation of S. lactis on media with grown cultures of Saccharomyces ludwigii, Hansenula anomala, Kluyveromyces lactis, Endomyces magnusi, Zigowilliopsis californicus, and Rhodotorula colostri resulted in formation of an association providing active growth and development of S. lactis with complete realization of its biosynthetic capacity.
TI  - Partial purification and some properties of phi C2(W) lysin, a lytic enzyme produced by phage-infected cells of Streptococcus lactis C2.
AB  - The lytic enzyme present in phi C2(W) lysates was isolated by means of ion-exchange chromatography and further purified by gel filtration and ultrafiltration. The phage enzyme had an apparent pH optimum of 6.5-6.9 and was rapidly inactivated at temperatures greater than 47 degrees C. The apparent temperature optimum was 37 degrees C and Q10 and Ea values over the range 22-32 degrees C were 2.5 and 69.2 kJ/mol respectively. Monovalent and divalent cations activated the enzyme. Reduced -SH groups on the enzyme were required for lytic activity. Gel filtration revealed a mol. wt of approximately 46000. Strain-dependent differences in sensitivity of group N lactic streptococci to lysin were found. Group D streptococci were also lysed. Strains of three species of Leuconostoc, two species of Lactobacillus, one strain of Escherichia coli and of Micrococcus lysodeikticus were apparently resistant. Analysis of cell wall degradation products gave results which were consistent with the lysin having the specificity of an N-acetylmuramidase.
TI  - Lysin production by phi C2(W), a prolate phage for Streptococcus lactis C2.
AB  - A bacteriophage, phi C2(W), which attacked Streptococcus lactis strains C2, ML3 and 712, is described. It had a prolate head and non-contractile tail and produced large haloes around plaques. Infection of eight paired-strain cultures, each containing Str. lactis C2, with phi C2(W) resulted in marked inhibition of acid production for six cultures. Direct phage-nonhomologous "host' contact was not required for inhibition. Lysates of phi C2(W) contained a phage-induced lysin. Evidence is presented that the inhibitory effect of phi C2(W) against paired and multi-strain cultures is due to the lysis of phage-insensitive strains by phage lysin. An isometric phage, phi 712, was shown not to produce such a lysin.
TI  - Kinetics of activation of L-lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus lactis by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
AB  - A lag is observed before the steady state during pyruvate reduction catalysed by  lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus lactis. The lag is abolished by preincubation of enzyme with the activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate before mixing with the substrates. The rate constants for the lag phase showed a linear dependence on fructose-1,6-bisphosphate concentration, with a second-order rate constant of 2.0 X 10(4) M-1 s-1, but were independent of enzyme concentration. Binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate produces a decrease in the protein fluorescence of the enzyme. The second-order rate constant for the fluorescence change is twice that for the lag in pyruvate reduction. The results suggest that binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate induces a conformational change in the enzyme, producing a form with reduced protein fluorescence and increased activity towards pyruvate reduction.
TI  - Adaptation of lactic streptococci for growth with their homologous bacteriophage.
AB  - The adaptation of lactic streptococci for growth with their homologous bacteriophage was studied through the addition of bacteriophage filtrate to skim milk medium inoculated with Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus cremoris. Both S. lactis and S. cremoris attained their adaptability for growth with their homologous bacteriophage after 5 and 2 transferes, respectively, and did not lose it after a storage period of 30 days at 0 degree C.
TI  - Interaction between Streptococcus lactis and Aspergillus flavus on production of  aflatoxin.
AB  - The inoculation of Aspergillus flavus spores into a culture of Streptococcus lactis in Lablemco tryptone broth medium resulted in little or no aflatoxin accumulation even though the growth of the fungus was not hindered. The drop in pH and reduced nutrient levels in the medium as a result of the S. lactis growth were not the cause of the observed inhibition. The inhibition was not eliminated by the addition of carbohydrate equal to the amount used by the bacterium before the inoculation with the fungus. Aflatoxin levels were also markedly reduced when S. lactis was inoculated into a growing A. flavus culture. In addition to inhibiting the synthesis of aflatoxin, S. lactis also degraded preformed toxin. A. flavus, on the other hand, not only reduced the growth of S. lactis but also affected the morphology of the bacterial cell; the cells became elongated and formed long chains. S. lactis produced and excreted the inhibitor into the medium late in its growth phase. The inhibitor was a heat-stable low-molecular-weight compound. Chloroform extracts of A. flavus grown in the presence of S. lactis were toxic to Bacillus megaterium but did not exhibit mutagenic or carcinogenic activity in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity test.
TI  - Fate of aflatoxin B-1 in fermented dairy products.
AB  - Polyacrylamide gel electropheresis and thin layer chromatography (TLC) were applied to detect the fate of aflatoxin B-1 in milk fermented with an active culture of Streptococcus lactis (ATCC-11454). TLC analysis revealed the formation of two fluorescent metabolites (B2a and R0) in fermented milk. Electropheretic analysis of both casein and whey protein showed fluorescent bands in the region of Kappa-casien and immunoglobulin which are glycoproteins in nature. The transformation of B-1 to the nontoxic metabolite B2a and the less toxic compound aflatoxicol (R0) reflects the preference for fermented dairy products in consumption in order to reduce chances of toxicity.
TI  - Characterization of phosphate:hexose 6-phosphate antiport in membrane vesicles of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Membrane vesicles of Streptococcus lactis were used to characterize a novel anion exchange involving phosphate and sugar 6-phosphates. For vesicles loaded with 50 mM phosphate at pH 7, homologous phosphate:phosphate exchange had a maximal rate of 130 nmol/min/mg of protein and a Kt of 0.21 mM external phosphate; among phosphate analogues tested, only arsenate replaced phosphate. Heterologous exchange was studied by 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate entry into phosphate-loaded vesicles; this reaction had a maximal velocity of 31 nmol/min/mg of protein and a Kt of 26 microM external substrate. Sugar phosphate moved intact during this exchange, since its entry led to loss of internal 32Pi without transfer of 32P to sugar phosphate. Inhibitions of phosphate exchange suggested that the preferred sugar phosphate substrates were (Kiapp): glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, and mannose 6-phosphates (approximately 20 microM) greater than fructose 6-phosphate (150 microM) greater than glucosamine 6-phosphate (420 microM) greater than alpha-methylglucoside 6-phosphate (740 microM). Stoichiometry for phosphate:2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate antiport was 2:1 at pH 7, and since initial rates of exchange were unaffected by charge carrying ionophores (gramicidin, valinomycin, a protonophore), this unequal stoichiometry indicated the electroneutral exchange of two monovalent phosphates for a single divalent sugar phosphate.
TI  - Construction of plasmid cloning vectors for lactic streptococci which also replicate in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cryptic Streptococcus cremoris Wg2 plasmid pWV01 (1.5 megadaltons) was genetically marked with the chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) gene from pC194. The recombinant plasmid (pGK1, 2.4 megadaltons) replicated and expressed Cmr in Bacillus subtilis. From this plasmid an insertion-inactivation vector was constructed by inserting the erythromycin resistance (Emr) gene from pE194 cop-6. This plasmid (pGK12, 2.9 megadaltons) contained a unique BclI site in the Emr gene and unique ClaI and HpaII sites outside both resistance genes. It was stably maintained in B. subtilis at a copy number of approximately 5. pGK12 also transformed Escherichia coli competent cells to Cmr and Emr. The copy number in E. coli was about 60. Moreover, pGK12 transformed protoplasts of Streptococcus lactis. In this host both resistance genes are expressed. pGK12 is stably maintained in S. lactis at a copy number of 3.
TI  - Bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: P-Ser-HPr and  its possible regulatory function?
AB  - HPr of the bacterial phosphotransferase system is a histidine-containing phospho-carrier protein. It is phosphorylated at a single histidyl residue with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and enzyme I and transfers the histidyl-bound phosphoryl group to a variety of factor III proteins. Recently, we described an HPr phosphorylated at a seryl residue (P-Ser-HPr), which is formed in an adenosine 5'-triphosphate dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase [Deutscher, J., & Saier, M.-H., Jr. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 6790-6794]. Now we demonstrate that this P-Ser-HPr is an altered substrate of phosphorylated enzyme I and factor III proteins compared to unphosphorylated HPr. Thus, P-Ser-HPr of Streptococcus lactis is phosphorylated about 5000 times slower by PEP and enzyme I than HPr. The slow phosphorylation by PEP and enzyme I can be overcome when factor III protein specific for gluconate (factor III(Gct)) of Streptococcus faecalis is added. Most likely, a complex of P-Ser-HPr and factor III(Gct) is formed which then becomes phosphorylated as fast as free HPr. Factor III protein specific for lactose (factor III(Lac)) of Staphylococcus aureus also enhances the phosphorylation of P-Ser-HPr by enzyme I and PEP, but its effect is lower. Thus, P-Ser-HPr is phosphorylated 70-100-fold slower in the presence of factor III(Lac) than in the presence of factor III(Gct). The described interaction of P-Ser-HPr with enzyme I in the presence of different factor III proteins could account for the regulation of sugar uptake within the phosphotransferase system. Some of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system sugars like glucose are known to be taken up in preference to others, for example, lactose.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - Transformation of Streptococcus sanguis Challis with Streptococcus lactis plasmid DNA.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis plasmid DNA, which is required for the fermentation of lactose (plasmid pLM2001), and a potential streptococcal cloning vector plasmid (pDB101) which confers resistance to erythromycin were evaluated by transformation into Streptococcus sanguis Challis. Plasmid pLM2001 transformed lactose-negative (Lac-) mutants of S. sanguis with high efficiency and was capable of conferring lactose-metabolizing ability to a mutant deficient in Enzyme IIlac, Factor IIIlac, and phospho-beta-galactosidase of the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system. Plasmid pDB101 was capable of high-efficiency transformation of S. sanguis to antibiotic resistance, and the plasmid could be readily isolated from transformed strains. However, when 20 pLM2001 Lac+ transformants were analyzed by a variety of techniques for the presence of plasmids, none could be detected. In addition, attempts to cure the Lac+ transformants by treatment with acriflavin were unsuccessful. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to demonstrate that the transformants had acquired a phospho-beta-galactosidase characteristic of that normally produced by S. lactis and not S. sanguis. It is proposed that the genes required for lactose fermentation may have become stabilized in the transformants due to their integration into the host chromosome. The efficient transformation into and expression of pLM2001 and pDB101 genes in S. sanguis provides a model system which could allow the development of a system for cloning genes from dairy starter cultures into S. sanguis to examine factors affecting their expression and regulation.
TI  - Regulation of product formation during glucose or lactose limitation in nongrowing cells of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Nongrowing cells of Streptococcus lactis in a pH-stat were dosed with sugar to allow fermentation at the maximum rate or were fed a continuous supply of sugar at rates less than the maximum. Under anaerobic conditions, rapid fermentation of either glucose or lactose was essentially homolactic. However, with strain ML3, limiting the fermentation rate diverted approximately half of the pyruvate to formate, acetate, and ethanol. At limiting glucose fermentation rates, cells contained lower concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase activator (fructose 1,6-diphosphate) and pyruvate formate-lyase inhibitors (triose phosphates). As a result, pyruvate formate-lyase and pyruvate dehydrogenase play a greater role in pyruvate metabolism. In contrast to strain ML3, strain ML8 did not give the same diversion of products under anaerobic conditions, and cells retained higher concentrations of the above effector compounds. Lactose metabolism under aerobic conditions resulted in pyruvate excretion by both S. lactis ML3 and ML8. At 7% of the maximum utilization rate, pyruvate accounted for 69 and 35% of the lactose metabolized by ML3 and ML8, respectively. Acetate was also a major product, especially with ML8. The data suggest that NADH oxidase is involved in coenzyme recycling in the presence of oxygen and that pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated, but the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex still functions.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the lactose-metabolizing genes from Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Restriction endonucleases and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to analyze plasmid pLM2001, which is required for lactose metabolism by Streptococcus lactis LM0232. The enzymes XhoI, SstI, BamHI, and KpnI each cleaved the plasmid into two fragments, whereas EcoRI and BglII cleaved the plasmid into seven and five fragments, respectively. Sizing of fragments and multiple digestions allowed construction of a composite restriction map. The KpnI fragments of pLM2001 were cloned into the KpnI cleavage site of the vector plasmid pDB101. A recombinant plasmid (pSH3) obtained from a lactose-fermenting, erythromycin-resistant (Lac+ Eryr) transformant of Streptococcus sanguis Challis was analyzed by enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmid pSH3 contained 7 of the 11 KpnI-HindIII fragments from pLM2001 and 5 of the 7 fragments from pDB101. It was determined that a 23-kilobase (kb) KpnI-generated fragment from pLM2001 had been cloned into pDB101 with deletion of part of the vector plasmid. The recombinant plasmid could be transformed with high frequency into several Lac- strains of S. sanguis, conferring the ability to ferment lactose and erythromycin resistance. The presence of pSH3 allowed a strain deficient in Enzyme IIlac, Factor IIIlac, and phospho-beta-galactosidase of the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system to efficiently ferment lactose. Under conditions designed to maximize curing of plasmid DNA with acriflavin, no Lac- derivatives could be isolated from cells transformed with pSH3. Seven of the 40 Lac+ colonies isolated after 10 transfers in acriflavin were shown to be sensitive to erythromycin and did not appear to harbor plasmid DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Plasmid transformation of Streptococcus lactis protoplasts: optimization and use  in molecular cloning.
AB  - The parameters affecting polyethylene glycol-induced plasmid transformation of Streptococcus lactis LM0230 protoplasts were examined to increase the transformation frequency. In contrast to spreading protoplasts over the surface of an agar medium, their incorporation into soft agar overlays enhanced regeneration of protoplasts and eliminated variability in transformation frequencies. Polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 3,350 at a final concentration of 22.5% yielded optimal transformation. A 20-min polyethylene glycol treatment of protoplasts in the presence of DNA was necessary for maximal transformation. The number of transformants recovered increased as the protoplast and DNA concentration increased over a range of 3.0 X 10(6) to 3.0 X 10(8) protoplasts and 0.25 to 4.0 micrograms of DNA per assay, respectively. With these parameters, transformation was increased to 5 X 10(3) to 4 X 10(4) transformants per microgram of DNA. Linear and recombinant plasmid DNA transformed, but at frequencies 10- to 100-fold lower than that of covalently closed circular DNA. Transformation of recombinant DNA molecules enabled the cloning of restriction endonuclease fragments coding for lactose metabolism into S. lactis LM0230 with the Streptococcus sanguis cloning vector, pGB301. These results demonstrated that the transformation frequency is sufficient to clone plasmid-coded genes which should prove useful for strain improvement of dairy starter cultures.
TI  - Use of 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and 14C fluorography in studies of glycolysis and regulation of pyruvate kinase in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - High-resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and 14C fluorography  have been used to identify and quantitate intermediates of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway in intact cells and cell extracts of Streptococcus lactis. Glycolysing cells contained high levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (a positive effector of pyruvate kinase) but comparatively low concentrations of other glycolytic metabolites. By contrast, starved organisms contained only high levels of 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate. The concentration of Pi (a negative effector of pyruvate kinase) in starved cells was fourfold greater than that maintained by glycolysing cells. The following result suggest that retention of the phosphoenolpyruvate pool by starved cells is a consequence of Pi-mediated inhibition of pyruvate kinase: the increase in the phosphoenolpyruvate pool (and Pi) preceded depletion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and reduction in intracellular Pi (by a maltose-plus-arginine phosphate trap) caused the restoration of pyruvate kinase activity in starved cells. Time course studies showed that Pi was conserved by formation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate during glycolysis. Conversely, during starvation high levels of Pi were generated concomitant with depletion of intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The concentrations of Pi and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate present in starved and glycolysing cells of S. lactis varied inversely. The activity of pyruvate kinase in the growing cell may be modulated by the relative concentrations of the two antagonistic effectors.
TI  - Genetic and physical characterization of recombinant plasmids associated with cell aggregation and high-frequency conjugal transfer in Streptococcus lactis ML3.
AB  - Restriction mapping was employed to characterize the 104-kilobase (kb) cointegrate lactose plasmids from 15 independent transconjugants derived from Streptococcus lactis ML3 as well as the 55-kb lactose plasmid ( pSK08 ) and a previously uncharacterized 48.4-kb plasmid ( pRS01 ) from S. lactis ML3. The data revealed that the 104-kb plasmids were cointegrates of pSK08 and pRS01 and were structurally distinct. The replicon fusion event occurred within adjacent 13.8- or 7.3-kb PvuII fragments of pSK08 and interrupted apparently random regions of pRS01 . Correlation of the transconjugants' clumping and conjugal transfer capabilities with the interrupted region of pRS01 identified pRS01 regions coding for these properties. In the 104-kb plasmids, the pRS01 region was present in both orientations with respect to the pSK08 region. The replicon fusion occurred in recombination-deficient (Rec-) strains and appeared to introduce a 0.8 to 1.0-kb segment of DNA within the junction fragments. The degeneration of the cointegrate plasmids was monitored by examining the lactose plasmids from nonclumping derivatives of clumping transconjugants. These plasmids displayed either precise or imprecise excision of pRS01 sequences or had dramatically reduced copy numbers. Both alterations occurred by rec-independent mechanisms. Alterations of a transconjugant 's clumping phenotype also occurred by rec-independent inversion of a 4.3-kb KpnI-PvuII fragment within the pRS01 sequences of the cointegrate plasmid.
TI  - Two plasmid-determined restriction and modification systems in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Two restriction and modification systems were found in Streptococcus lactis strain IL594 which was found to contain 9 plasmids designated pIL1 to pIL9. On the basis of protoplast-induced curing experiments, we showed that a restriction and modification system was related to the presence of pIL6 or pIL7. The pIL6-determined restriction and modification system was confirmed by cotransfer of the plasmid and of the restriction and modification system to a plasmid-free, nonrestricting, and nonmodifying derivative of S. lactis IL594.
TI  - Microscale method for rapid isolation of covalently closed circular plasmid DNA from group N streptococci.
AB  - A method for rapid purification of plasmid DNA from lactic streptococci, utilizing microliter quantities of reagents, was developed by combination of a short lysozyme-mutanolysin cell wall digestion with a modification of the Escherichia coli plasmid isolation procedure of McMaster et al. (Anal. Biochem. 109:47-54, 1980). The preparations obtained were highly enriched for covalently closed circular DNA, and the method was applicable to plasmids of at least 40 megadaltons. Centrifugation in CsCl-ethidium bromide density gradients was not required.
TI  - Phosphate/hexose 6-phosphate antiport in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - After growth in appropriate media, resting cells of Streptococcus lactis 7962 showed a rapid exchange between external and internal pools of inorganic phosphate. This exchange was not found in other strains of S. lactis (ML3, 133, or K1) or in Streptococcus faecalis. Phosphate exchange in S. lactis 7962 did not require other anions or cations in the assay medium, nor was phosphate influx affected by the membrane potential and pH gradient formed during glycolysis. Thus, the exchange reaction was independent of known ionic drivers (H+, Na+, OH-, etc.). Experiments testing inhibitions of phosphate entry suggested that alternative substrates for exchange included arsenate, as well as the 6-phosphates of glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, fructose, mannose, or glucosamine, and direct studies with 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate verified that resting cells could accumulate this sugar phosphate to levels expected for exchange with internal phosphate. Two other observations supported the idea of an exchange between phosphate and sugar phosphate. First, early addition of the heterologous substrate blocked entry of the test compound, whereas later addition caused efflux of preaccumulated material. Second, expression of phosphate exchange and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport varied in parallel. Both activities were found at high levels after growth in medium supplemented with rhamnose or arabinose, at intermediate levels with addition of galactose, and at low levels after growth with glucose, fructose, or mannose. We conclude that these findings describe a novel anion antiporter that mediates the exchange of phosphate (arsenate) and sugar 6-phosphates.
TI  - [Protoplast isolation from a nisin-forming culture of Streptococcus lactis strain MGU].
AB  - A procedure for protoplasts of Str. lactis producing nisin was developed. The following lysing factors were used for obtaining the protoplasts: lycozyme, LE enzyme, lysosubtilin and an enzyme isolated from the culture fluid A. levoris. The use of the above factors in different combinations provided an increase in the number of the formed protoplasts from 1-2 in the field of the microscope vision to 15-20, which amounted to 25 per cent of the total number of the cells visible under microscope.
TI  - Conjugal transfer and characterization of bacteriocin plasmids in group N (lactic acid) streptococci.
AB  - Thirteen bacteriocin-producing strains of group N (lactic acid) streptococci were screened for their potential to transfer this property by conjugation to Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis Bu2-60. Bacteriocin production in three strains was plasmid encoded as shown by conjugal transfer and by analysis of cured, bacteriocin-negative derivatives of the donor strains and the transconjugants. With Streptococcus cremoris strains 9B4 and 4G6 and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis 6F7 as donors, bacteriocin-producing transconjugants were isolated with frequencies ranging from ca. 2 X 10(-2) to 2 X 10(-1) per recipient cell. Bacteriocin-producing transconjugants had acquired a 39.6-megadalton plasmid from the donor strains 9B4 and 4G6, and a 75-megadalton plasmid from the donor strain 6F7. As shown by restriction endonuclease analysis, the plasmids from strains 9B4 and 4G6 were almost identical. The plasmid from strain 6F7 yielded some additional fragments not present in the two other plasmids. In hybridization experiments any of the three plasmids strongly hybridized with each other and with some other bacteriocin but nontransmissible plasmids from other S. cremoris strains. Homology was also detected to a variety of cryptic plasmids in lactic acid streptococci.
TI  - Differentiation of lactic streptococcal phages into phage species by DNA-DNA homology.
AB  - Twenty-five lactic streptococcal bacteriophages were differentiated by DNA homology into four species. Complete correlation was found between DNA homology groups and morphological characteristics of the phages except that two phage types, which differed in only the presence or absence of a collar, were one species by DNA homology. These findings were supported by serological data and differences in DNA molecular weights of the proposed species. The complete lack of homology between these phage species indicates that they are unlikely to have a recent common phage ancestor and that one morphological type of phage has not been derived by mutation from a phage of another morphological type.
TI  - [Trials of cheese-making using concentrated bacterial starters].
AB  - Studies about cheese preparation with frozen and concentrated bacterial starters  have been carried out. The Pategras cheeses were obtained from raw milk. The starters were prepared with a selected strain of Streptococcus lactis, concentrated until reaching a value of 3.10(9) colony forming units/ml and resuspended in milk previously supplemented with 8% of yeast extract. These concentrates were frozen at -40 degrees C and kept at -20 degrees C for 60 days. Three kinds of starters were tested: one thawed by placing the flask in a 40 degrees C water bath, another added to the cheese vat without previous thawing and a control sample prepared in steamed reconstituted milk. In order to evaluate the convenience of each technique several chemical and microbiological analysis were performed during the preparation (Table 1 and 2) and the ripening of the cheese (Table 3). The results have showed that the direct use of thawed frozen concentrates in the cheese vat allows the obtaining of high quality cheese. On the other hand, the technique based on thawing through a water bath did not lead to good results.
TI  - [Conjugational plasmid transfer from A, B and H streptococci to N streptococci].
AB  - Plasmid-mediated resistance to erythromycin and chloramphenicol was successfully  transferred from group A, B and H streptococci to group N streptococci by a process akin to conjugation. The results showed that plasmids from streptococcal groups other than N were able to replicate in lactic streptococci as well. The transfer experiments were carried out by using a membrane filter mating technique. Four of the five plasmids used (pSM15346, pSM10419, pIP501, and pEL1) were transferred at frequencies ranging from 10(-1) to 10(-8) transconjugants per donor colony-forming unit. The highest transfer frequencies were obtained when S. pyogenes strain 15346 (pSM15346) served as the donor strain. The identy of transconjugants was verified by testing for the presence of unselected markers of the recipient strains, and both transduction and transformation were ruled out as the mechanisms of transfer.
TI  - Conjugative 40-megadalton plasmid in Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC3 is associated with resistance to nisin and bacteriophage.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC3 was examined for plasmid DNA and found to contain a previously unreported plasmid of 40 X 10(6) daltons. This plasmid, designated pNP40, was conjugally transferred to a plasmid-cured derivative of S. lactis C2. Transconjugants containing pNP40 acquired resistance to nisin produced by strains of S. lactis and to commercially available nisin when assay plates were incubated at 21, 32, and 37 degrees C. In addition, c2 phage growth was completely restricted in transconjugants containing pNP40 at 21 and 32 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. This result suggests that pNP40 may be coding for a temperature-sensitive enzyme that restricts phage growth at 21 and 32 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. Eight consecutive transfers of a transconjugant containing pNP40 in Elliker broth at 37 degrees C resulted in 100% loss of resistance to c2 phage when colonies were tested at 32 degrees C. These phage-sensitive isolates had lost pNP40 and had also become sensitive to nisin. This result suggests that pNP40 may also be thermosensitive in its replication. The finding of a phage resistance determinant located on a conjugative plasmid should prove useful in constructing phage-resistant variants for dairy fermentation processes.
TI  - Properties of a Streptococcus lactis strain that ferments lactose slowly.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis 7962, which ferments lactose slowly, has a lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and low phospho-beta-galactosidase activity, in addition to high beta-galactosidase activity. Lactose 6'-phosphate accumulated to a high concentration (greater than 100 mM) in cells growing on lactose. In contrast, lactic streptococci, which ferment lactose rapidly and use only the lactose-phosphotransferase system for uptake, contained high phospho-beta-galactosidase activity and low concentrations (0.9 to 1.6 mM) of lactose 6'-phosphate. It is concluded that rate-limiting phospho-beta-galactosidase activity is primarily responsible for defective lactose metabolism in S. lactis 7962.
TI  - [Fragmentation of the lactose-protease plasmid in lactose-negative derivatives of Streptococcus lactis and S. lactis ssp. diacetylactis].
AB  - DNA analysis showed the presence of plasmids in all 29 strains of mesophilic lactic streptococci. Their number ranged from 1 to 9 and their molecular weight extended from 1.8 to 45 megadaltons (Md). Comparison of the plasmid profiles from 9 strains of Streptococcus lactis, 3 strains of S. lactis ssp. diacetylactis and from their Lac-,Prt-variants was carried out. In most of the strains, a single plasmid of 27 to 45 Md carried both the lactose and protease (lac and prt) determinants. In Lac- variants, this composite plasmid may at times be lost; in most derivatives, this plasmid was fragmented into several smaller plasmids. Fragmentation resulted in the inactivation of lac genes and often of prt genes; sometimes prt genes remained intact in one of these new plasmids. Fragmentation of the plasmid may also take place without inactivation of these metabolic genes. Restriction analysis of the lactose-protease plasmid from 3 strains of S. lactis and from one Lac-variant confirmed the plasmid fragmentation phenomenon, and led to a proposal for physical mapping of the plasmid and preliminary localization of the lac-prt genes.
TI  - Involvement of lactose enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system in rapid expulsion of free galactosides from Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes accumulated thiomethyl-beta-galactoside as the 6-phosphate ester due to the action of the phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system. Subsequent addition of glucose resulted in rapid efflux of the free galactoside after intracellular dephosphorylation (inducer expulsion). Efflux was shown to occur in the apparent absence of the galactose permease, but was inhibited by substrate analogs of the lactose enzyme II and could not be demonstrated in a mutant of S. lactis ML3 which lacked this enzyme. The results suggest that the enzymes II of the phosphotransferase system can catalyze the rapid efflux of free sugar under appropriate physiological conditions.
TI  - Intracellular hexose-6-phosphate:phosphohydrolase from Streptococcus lactis: purification, properties, and function.
AB  - An intracellular hexose 6-phosphate:phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.2) has been purified from Streptococcus lactis K1. Polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed one major activity staining protein and one minor inactive band. The Mr determined by gel permeation chromatography was 36,500, but sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single polypeptide of apparent Mr 60,000. The enzyme exhibited a marked preference for hexose 6-phosphates, and the rate of substrate hydrolysis (at 5 mM concentration) decreased in the order, galactose 6-phosphate greater than 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate greater than fructose 6-phosphate greater than mannose 6-phosphate greater than glucose 6-phosphate. Hexose 1-phosphates, p-nitrophenylphosphate, pyrophosphate, and nucleotides were not hydrolyzed at a significant rate. In addition, the glycolytic intermediates comprising the intracellular phosphoenolpyruvate potential in the starved cells (phosphoenolpyruvate and 2- and 3-phosphoglyceric acids) were not substrates for the phosphatase. Throughout the isolation, the hexose 6-phosphate:phosphohydrolase was stabilized by Mn2+ ion, and the purified enzyme was dependent upon Mn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, or Co2+ for activation. Other divalent metal ions including Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, and Ni2+ were unable to activate the enzyme, and the first four cations were potent inhibitors. Enzymatic hydrolysis of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate was inhibited by fluoride when Mg2+ was included in the assay, but only slight inhibition occurred in the presence of Mn2+, Fe2+, or Co2+. The inhibitory effect of Mg2+ plus fluoride was specifically and completely reversed by Fe2+ ion. The hexose 6-phosphate:phosphohydrolase catalyzes the in vivo hydrolysis of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate in stage II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent futile cycle in S. lactis (J. Thompson and B. M. Chassy, J. Bacteriol. 151:1454-1465, 1982).
TI  - The use of mesophilic cultures in the dairy industry.
AB  - The use of mesophilic starter cultures, containing group N Streptococcus and Leuconostoc species, in the dairy industry is examined. Bacteriophage attack is identified as the main cause of culture inhibition and criteria used to select stable mixed-strain starter cultures and phage-insensitive defined strains are established. The key aspects of culture propagation and storage are highlighted, as well as bulk-culture protection based on physical exclusion of phage and the use of phage-inhibitory media. Developments in the application of starter culture systems in different countries are examined and show that significant process control and elimination of phage problems can be achieved.
TI  - Genetic transfer systems in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Gene transfer processes (transduction, conjugation, protoplast fusion mediated exchange, transformation in protoplasts) in lactic acid bacteria are reviewed in this paper. Besides, the detailed molecular nature of lactose plasmids in the Streptococcus lactis C2, 712 and ML3 strain complex is discussed.
TI  - Identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). PBPs with similar properties are carried by strains of Streptococcus durans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The strains carrying the slow-reacting PBP demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. Spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from S. faecium ATCC 9790. They all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting PBP produced. Mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of S. durans, S. faecalis, and S. faecium. All of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting PBP than that carried by the parent. Finally, it was found that resistant S. faecium ATCC 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all PBPs except PBP 5. Cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting PBP by 90%. This penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Functional properties of plasmids in lactic streptococci.
AB  - Plasmid biology has become an important area of investigation in dairy starter cultures since it now appears that some properties, vital for successful milk fermentations, are coded by genes located on plasmid DNA. Some of these metabolic properties observed in lactic streptococci have been clearly established as being plasmid-mediated. Examples would be lactose utilization and in Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis the ability to produce a bacteriocin-like substance. Phenotypic and physical evidence for plasmid linkage has been obtained for other traits such as citrate, sucrose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose utilization, proteinase activity, modification/restriction systems, as well as for nisin production. Further genetic evidence is now needed to confirm plasmid association to these properties. For some characteristics the association with plasmids is highly speculative and is solely based on the phenotypic loss of a metabolic property. In this category would be sensitivity to agglutinins, sensitivity to the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide inhibitory system, arginine hydrolysis, and slime production. Other properties which appear plasmid-mediated in lactic streptococci and which will be discussed include inorganic ion resistance, drug resistance, and diplococcin production.
TI  - Isolation of a recombination-deficient mutant of Streptococcus lactis ML3.
AB  - A recombination-deficient mutant of Streptococcus lactis ML3 designated MMS36 was isolated on the basis of its sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate. This mutant also displayed sensitivity to UV irradiation. The inability of MMS36 to mediate homologous recombination was demonstrated by transduction of plasmid-linked lactose fermenting ability but not chromosomally mediated streptomycin resistance.

TI  - Plasmid linkage of a bacteriocin-like substance in Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis strain WM4: transferability to Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis strain WM4 transferred lactose-fermenting and bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) abilities to S. lactis LM2301, a lactose-negative, streptomycin-resistant (Lac- Strr), plasmid-cured derivative of S. lactis C2. Three types of transconjugants were obtained: Lac+ Bac+, Lac+ Bac-, and Lac-Bac+.S. diacetylactis WM4 possessed plasmids of 88, 33, 30, 5.5, 4.8, and 3.8 megadaltons (Mdal). In Lac+ Bac+ transconjugants, lactose-fermenting ability was linked to the 33-Mdal plasmid and bacteriocin-producing ability to the 88-Mdal plasmid. Curing the 33-Mdal plasmid from Lac+ Bac+ transconjugants resulted in loss of lactose-fermenting ability but not bacteriocin-producing ability (Lac- Bac+). These strains retained the 88-Mdal plasmid. Curing of both plasmids resulted in a Lac- Bac- phenotype. The Lac+ Bac- transconjugant phenotype was associated with a recombinant plasmid of 55 or 65 Mdal. When these transconjugants were used as donors in subsequent matings, the frequency of Lac transfer was about 2.0 X 10(-2) per recipient plated, whereas when Lac+ Bac+ transconjugants served as donors, the frequency of Lac transfer was about 2.0 X 10(-5) per recipient plated. Also, Lac- Bac+ transconjugants were found to contain the 88-Mdal plasmid. The data indicate that the ability of WM4 to produce bacteriocin is linked to an 88-Mdal conjugative plasmid and that lactose-fermenting ability resides on a 33-Mdal plasmid.
TI  - Regulation of glycolysis and sugar phosphotransferase activities in Streptococcus lactis: growth in the presence of 2-deoxy-D-glucose.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis K1 has the capacity to grow on many sugars, including sucrose and lactose, in the presence of high levels (greater than 500 mM) of 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Initially, growth of the organism was transiently halted by the addition of comparatively low concentrations (less than 0.5 mM) of the glucose analog to the culture. Inhibition was coincident with (i) rapid accumulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate (ca. 120 mM) and preferential utilization of phosphoenolpyruvate via the mannose:phosphotransferase system, (ii) depletion of phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates, and (iii) a 60% reduction in intracellular ATP concentration. During the 5- to 10-min period of bacteriostasis the intracellular concentration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate rapidly declined, and the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates were restored to near-normal levels. When growth resumed, the cell doubling time (Td) and the steady-state levels of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate maintained by the cells were dependent upon the medium concentration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Resistance of S. lactis K1 to the potentially toxic analog was a consequence of negative regulation of the mannose:phosphotransferase system by two independent mechanisms. The first, short-term response occurred immediately after the initial "overshoot" accumulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate, and this mechanism reduced the activity (fine control) of the mannose:phosphotransferase system. The second, long-term mechanism resulted in repression of synthesis (coarse control) of enzyme IImannose. The two regulatory mechanisms reduced the rate of 2-deoxy-D-glucose translocation via the mannose:phosphotransferase system and minimized the activity of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent futile cycle of the glucose analog (J. Thompson and B. M. Chassy, J. Bacteriol. 151:1454-1465, 1982). Phosphoenolpyruvate was thus conserved for transport of the growth sugar and for generation of ATP required for biosynthetic and work functions of the growing cell.
TI  - Plasmid complements of Streptococcus lactis NCDO 712 and other lactic streptococci after protoplast-induced curing.
AB  - The production and regeneration of bacterial protoplasts promoted the loss of three different plasmid-specified traits in Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis strains. The loss of five different plasmids, including small multicopy molecules, was readily detected in Streptococcus lactis 712 by screening lysates of random protoplast regenerants on agarose gels. In this strain sequential rounds of protoplast regeneration were used to produce a plasmid-free strain and derivatives carrying only single molecules from the plasmid complement. During these experiments a 33-megadalton plasmid, pLP712, was found to encode genes for lactose and protein utilization. Only this plasmid was required for normal growth and acid production in milk; the remaining four plasmids appeared to be cryptic. Lactose-defective derivatives of a strain carrying only pLP712 were readily isolated. Although these derivatives included instances of plasmid loss, deletions of pLP712 were frequently found. Many different deleted derivatives of pLP712, including some in which the lactose or protein utilization determinant or both were lost, were isolated. The molecular instability of pLP712 largely accounted for previous observations of plasmid complements in S. lactis 712 after lactose determinant curing or transfer by conjugation and transduction. Curing of cryptic molecules from multiple plasmid complements by protoplast regeneration may prove to be generally valuable in lactic streptococci and other gram-positive species.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Relationship between phosphorylation potential and electrochemical H+ gradient during glycolysis in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Assays of intracellular ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate allowed calculation of  the phosphorylation potential (delta G'ATP/F) maintained during glycolysis by Streptococcus lactis. At the same time, the electrochemical H+ gradient (delta mu-H+/F) was evaluated by distribution methods, using radioactive tetraphenylphosphonium bromide as a probe for the membrane potential and salicylic acid as a probe for the pH gradient. Detailed comparisons were made at pH 5, when the reaction mediated by the proton-translocating ATPase (BF0F1) was likely to have been poised near equilibrium; for those conditions, the ratio delta G'ATP/delta mu-H+ was used to estimate stoichiometry for BF0F1 during ATP hydrolysis. At an external pH of 5, in the presence or absence of valinomycin, this ratio was close to 3, over a range of 370 to 510 mV (8.5 to 11.7 kcal/mol) for delta G'ATP/F and a range of 128 to 167 mV for delta mu-H+/F. Other work suggested that delta G'ATP/delta mu-H+ increased from its minimum value of 3 to 4.3 as the external pH changed from pH 5 to 7.
TI  - [Preservation of lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The lyophilized Streptococcus lactis, S. cremoris, S. diacetilactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei C10, L. caucasicus cultures have had a great number of viable cells after 4 years storage. L. casei and S. cremoris strains endured 3 months storage at -30 degrees C and in the sterile vaseline oil for 8 months. After storage S. cremoris strains showed the high level of the lactic acid formation and of proteolytic and lipolytic activities.
TI  - Plasmid linkage of the D-tagatose 6-phosphate pathway in Streptococcus lactis: effect on lactose and galactose metabolism.
AB  - The three enzymes of the D-tagatose 6-phosphate pathway (galactose 6-phosphate isomerase, D-tagatose 6-phosphate kinase, and tagatose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase) were absent in lactose-negative (Lac-) derivatives of Streptococcus lactis C10, H1, and 133 grown on galactose. The lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and phospho-beta-galactosidase activities were also absent in Lac- derivatives of strains H1 and 133 and were low (possibly absent) in C10 Lac-. In all three Lac- derivatives, low galactose phosphotransferase system activity was found. On galactose, Lac- derivatives grew more slowly (presumably using the Leloir pathway) than the wild-type strains and accumulated high intracellular concentrations of galactose 6-phosphate (up to 49 mM); no intracellular tagatose 1,6-diphosphate was detected. The data suggest that the Lac phenotype is plasmid linked in the three strains studied, with the evidence being more substantial for strain H1. A Lac- derivative of H1 contained a single plasmid (33 megadaltons) which was absent from the Lac- mutant. We suggest that the genes linked to the lactose plasmid in S. lactis are more numerous than previously envisaged, coding for all of the enzymes involved in lactose metabolism from initial transport to the formation of triose phosphates via the D-tagatose 6-phosphate pathway.
TI  - [Nisin inactivation in a culture of the producer Streptococcus lactis strain MGU].
AB  - The intensive biosynthesis of nizin on the glucose-yeast medium is observed during the logarithmic and early lag phases of the staphylococcal growth. The ratio of nizin in the fermentation broth (free nazin) and that bound with the cells depended on pH of the medium. When pH was maintained at 6.6-6.8, the amount of nazin in the cells during and growth logarithmic phase was equal to its amount in the fermentation broth filtrate. During the lag phase marked inactivation of nizin was noted. periodical feeding of casein prevented the nizin inactivation. The preliminary data are indicative of the enzymatic nature of the antibiotic.
TI  - Novel phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent futile cycle in Streptococcus lactis: 2-deoxy-D-glucose uncouples energy production from growth.
AB  - The addition of 2-deoxy-D-glucose to cultures of Streptococcus lactis 133 that were growing exponentially on sucrose or lactose reduced the growth rate by ca. 95%. Inhibition did not occur with glucose or mannose as the growth sugar. The reduction in growth rate was concomitant with rapid accumulation of the analog in phosphorylated form (2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate) via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent mannose:phosphotransferase system. Within 5 min the intracellular 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate concentration reached a steady-state level of greater than 100 mM. After maximum accumulation of the sugar phosphate, the rate of sucrose metabolism (glycolysis) decreased by only 30%, but the cells were depleted of fructose-1,6-diphosphate. The addition of glucose to 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate preloaded cells caused expulsion of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and a resumption of normal growth. S. lactis 133 contained an intracellular Mg2+-dependent, fluoride-sensitive phosphatase which hydrolyzed 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate (and glucose 6-phosphate) to free sugar and inorganic phosphate. Because of continued dephosphorylation and efflux of the non-metabolizable analog, the maintenance of the intracellular 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate pool during growth stasis was dependent upon continued glycolysis. This steady-state condition represented a dynamic equilibrium of: (i) phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent accumulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphate, (ii) intracellular dephosphorylation, and (iii) efflux of free 2-deoxy-D-glucose. This sequence of events constitutes a futile cycle which promotes the dissipation of phosphoenolpyruvate. We conclude that 2-deoxy-D-glucose functions as an uncoupler by dissociating energy production from growth in S. lactis 133.

AB  - Two D-ketohexose 1,6-diphosphate aldolases are present in Streptococcus cremoris  E8 and S. lactis C10. One aldolase, which was induced by growth on either lactose or galactose, was active with both tagatose 1,6-diphosphate (TDP) and fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), having a lower Km and a higher Vmax with TDP as the substrate. This enzyme, named TDP aldolase, had properties typical of a class I aldolase, being insensitive to EDTA and showing substrate-dependent inactivation by sodium borohydride. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis indicated a subunit molecular weight of 34,500. The amino acid composition of TDP aldolase is reported. When the enzyme was incubated with either triose phosphates or FDP, the equilibrium mixture contained an FDP/TDP ratio of 6.9:1. The other aldolase, which had properties typical of a class II aldolase, showed activity with FDP but not with TDP. The intracellular TDP concentration, measured with the purified TDP aldolase, was 0.4 to 4.0 mM in cells growing on lactose or galactose and was lower (0 to 1.0 mM) in cells growing on glucose. The intracellular concentration of FDP was always higher than that of TDP. The role of ketohexose diphosphates in the regulation of end product fermentation by lactic streptococci is discussed.
TI  - HPr proteins of different microorganisms studied by hydrogen-1 high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance: similarities of structures and mechanisms.
AB  - The HPr proteins of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were studied by 1H NMR at 360 MHz. The "active-center" histidines of all HPr proteins are characterized by a low pK value between 5.6 and 6.1 and similar spectral parameters. Phosphorylation of the histidyl residues leads to an increase of the pK value of 2-3 units and spectral changes characteristic for N-1 phosphorylation of the histidyl ring. The spectra of the HPr proteins of S. lactis, S. Faecalis, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus reveal many similarities, whereas the spectrum of the E. coli protein is different with exception of the active-center histidine. The HPr protein of S. lactis is formylated at its terminal amino group.
TI  - Arginine metabolism in lactic streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis metabolizes arginine via the arginine deiminase pathway producing ornithine, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and ATP. In the four strains of S. lactis examined, the specific activities of arginine deiminase and ornithine transcarbamylase were 5- to 10-fold higher in galactose-grown cells compared with glucose- or lactose-grown cells. The addition of arginine increased the specific activities of these two enzymes with all growth sugars. The specific activity of the third enzyme involved in arginine metabolism (carbamate kinase) was not altered by the composition of the growth medium. In continuous cultures arginine deiminase was not induced, and arginine was not metabolized, until glucose limitation occurred. In batch cultures the metabolism of glucose and arginine was sequential, whereas galactose and arginine were metabolized concurrently, and the energy derived from arginine metabolism was efficiently coupled to growth. No arginine deiminase activity was detected in the nine Streptococcus cremoris strains examined, thus accounting for their inability to metabolize arginine. All nine strains of S. cremoris had specific activities of carbamate kinase similar to those found in S. lactis, but only five S. cremoris strains had ornithine transcarbamylase activity.
TI  - Electron microscopy of Streptococcus lactis phage plaque margins.
AB  - Ultrathin sections of plaques produced by Streptococcus lactis phages O712 and m13 were examined by transmission electron microscopy. The clear central area of the plaque was found to contain hardly any cellular material but the turbid margin contained abundant plasma membranes and some partially lysed cells whose appearance suggests a novel mechanism for the termination of plaque growth.
TI  - Restriction endonuclease analysis of the lactose plasmid in Streptococcus lactis  ML3 and two recombinant lactose plasmids.
AB  - We investigated the molecular relationship between the 60-megadalton (Mdal) recombinant lactose plasmids in ML 3 x LM2301 lactose-positive (Lac+) transconjugants and the genetic material of Streptococcus lactis ML3. Lactose metabolism is linked to the 33-Mdal plasmid pSK08 in ML3, and the recipient LM2301 is cured of plasmid DNA. The plasmids were analyzed with a series of restriction enzymes. We found that the 60-Mdal plasmids of Lac+ transconjugants contained pSK08 DNA, but were not simply dimers of pSK08. The 60-Mdal plasmids contained a segment of DNA not apparent in pSK08. The restriction patterns of the 60-Mdal plasmid in a Lac+ nonclumping transconjugant and that in a Lac+ clumping transconjugant were different. This suggested that there was a molecular differences between these two recombinant plasmids. We conclude that the segment of DNA in the 60-Mdal plasmids that was not present in pSK08 was the proposed transfer factor responsible for cell aggregation and high-frequency conjugation.
TI  - Distinct galactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Lactose-negative (Lac-) mutants were isolated from a variant of Streptococcus lactis C2 in which the lactose plasmid had become integrated into the chromosome. These mutants retained their parental growth characteristics on galactose (Lac- Gal+). This is in contrast to the Lac- variants obtained when the lactose plasmid is lost from S. lactis, which results in a slower growth rate on galactose (Lac- Gal+). The Lac- Gal+ mutants were defective in [14C]thiomethyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside accumulation, suggesting a defect in the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, but still possessed the ability to form galactose-1-phosphate and galactose-6-phosphate from galactose in a ratio similar to that observed from the parental strain. The Lac- Gald variant formed only galactose-1-phosphate. The results imply that galactose is not translocated via the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, but rather by a specific galactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system for which the genetic locus is also found on the lactose plasmid in S. lactis.

TI  - [Effect of regulators on bacterial autolysis].
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the effect of autolysis regulators (the fraction of microbial teichoic acids) on the rate of autolysis and the activity of bacterial extracellular lytic enzymes. The regulators of autolysis isolated from 23 cultures belonging to 10 microbial species regulated the rate of autolysis in Bacillus, E. coli and Streptococcus lactis. The regulators either activated or inhibited autolysis depending on the substrate (of a bacterium to be subjected to autolysis). The quantitative dependence of the autolysis rate on the regulator concentration was specific for each pair 'regulator--substrate'. The regulatory properties of the fraction of teichoic acids varied depending on the age of a culture from which they had been isolated. The regulators of autolysis, with an exception of the preparation from E. coli, inhibited the activity of B. subtilis extracellular lytic enzymes in the course of their action on E. coli cells. The possibility for using the regulators of autolysis in microbiological processes is discussed.
TI  - Stoichiometry of proton movements coupled to ATP synthesis driven by a pH gradient in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - An electrochemical potential difference for H+ was established across the plasma  membrane of the anaerobe Streptococcus lactis by addition of sulfuric acid to cells suspended in potassium phosphate at pH 8 along with valinomycin or permeant anions. Subsequent acidification of the cell was measured by the distribution of salicyclic acid. A comparison between cells treated or untreated with the inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was used to reveal that portion of net proton entry attributable to a direct coupling between H+ inflow and synthesis of ATP catalyzed by the reversible proton-translocating ATPase of this microorganism. When the imposed electrochemical proton gradient was below 180-190 mV, proton entry was at the rate expected of passive flux, for both control cells and cells treated with the ATPase inhibitor, However, at higher driving force acidification of control cells was markedly accelerated, coincident with ATP synthesis, while acidification of cells treated with the inhibitor continued at the rate characteristic of passive inflow. This observed threshold (180-190 mV) was identified as the reversal potential for this H+ "pump". Parallel measurements showed that the free energy of hydrolysis for ATP in these washed cells was 8.4 kcal/mole (370mV). The comparison between the reversal (threshold) potential and the free energy of hydrolysis for ATP indicates a stoichiometry of 2 H+/ATP for the coupling of proton movements to ATP formation in bacteria.
TI  - Phosphofructokinase from Streptococcus lactis.
AB  
TI  - [Conditions for nisin adsorption by Streptococcus lactis cells].
AB  - Some conditions for absorption of nisin, a polypeptide antibiotic by the cells of Str. lactis were studied. The amounts of nisin adsorbed by the cells depended on the culture age: at the late stationary phase the adsorption level was 2 times higher than that at the logarithmic phase. The cells grown on a "poor" medium adsorbed 85-90 per cent of nisin added to the solution, while the cells grown on the "rich" medium adsorbed 50 per cent of the antibiotic. The adsorption level of nisin by the cells subjected to a thermal shock was higher than that by the live cells. Desorption of nisin from the cells with acid ethanol and bivalent cation solutions was insignificant. Nisin is adsorbed by the cells of other microorganisms, the adsorption levels by the cells of Bac. brevis being the same as those by the streptococcal cells, while the levels adsorbed by Bac. polymyxa being 4 times lower.
TI  - Uptake and metabolism of sucrose by Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Transport and metabolism of sucrose in Streptococcus lactis K1 have been examined. Starved cells of S. lactis K1 grown previously on sucrose accumulated [14C]sucrose by a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) (sucrose-PTS; Km, 22 microM; Vmax, 191 mumol transported min-1 g of dry weight of cells-1). The product of group translocation was sucrose 6-phosphate (6-O-phosphoryl-D-glucopyranosyl-1-alpha-beta-2-D-fructofuranoside). A specific sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase was identified which cleaved the disaccharide phosphate (Km, 0.10 mM) to glucose 6-phosphate and fructose. The enzyme did not cleave sucrose 6'-phosphate(D-glucopyranosyl-1-alpha-beta-2-D-fructofuranoside-6'-phosphate). Extracts prepared from sucrose-grown cells also contained an ATP-dependent mannofructokinase which catalyzed the conversion of fructose to fructose 6-phosphate (Km, 0.33 mM). The sucrose-PTS and sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase activities were coordinately induced during growth on sucrose. Mannofructokinase appeared to be regulated independently of the sucrose-PTS and sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase, since expression also occurred when S. lactis K1 was grown on non-PTS sugars. Expression of the mannofructokinase may be negatively regulated by a component (or a derivative) of the PTS.
TI  - Recombinant plasmid associated cell aggregation and high-frequency conjugation of Streptococcus lactis ML3.
AB  - Lactose-positive (Lac+) transconjugants resulting from matings between Streptococcus lactic ML3 and S. lactis LM2301 possess a single plasmid of approximately 60 megadaltons (Mdal) which is nearly twice the size of the lactose plasmid of the donor. The majority of these Lac+ transconjugants aggregated in broth and were able to transfer lactose-fermenting ability at a frequency higher than 10(-1) per donor on milk agar plates or in broth. Lac+ transconjugants which did not clump conjugated at a much lower frequency. Lactose-negative derivatives of Lac+ clumping transconjugants did not aggregate in broth and were missing the 60-Mdal plasmid. The ability to aggregates in broth was very unstable. Strains could lose the ability to clump but retain lactose-fermenting ability. The majority of these Lac+ nonclumping derivatives of clumping transconjugants contained a plasmid of approximately 33 Mdal, the size of the lactose plasmid of the original donor ML3. These strains transferred lactose-fermenting ability at a frequency of approximately 10(-6) per donor, resulting in both Lac+ clumping transconjugants which contained a 60-Mdal plasmid and Lac+ nonclumping transconjugants which possessed a 33-Mdal plasmid. Our results suggest that the genes responsible for cell aggregation and high-frequency conjugation are on the segment of deoxyribonucleic acid which recombined with the 33-Mdal lactose plasmid in S. lactis ML3.
TI  - Regulation of methyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside-6-phosphate accumulation in Streptococcus lactis by exclusion and expulsion mechanisms.
AB  - Starved cells of Streptococcus lactis ML3 (grown previously on galactose, lactose, or maltose) accumulated methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (TMG) by the lactose:phosphotransferase system. More than 98% of accumulated sugar was present as a phosphorylated derivative, TMG-6-phosphate (TMG-6P). When a phosphotransferase system sugar (glucose, mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, or lactose) was added to the medium simultaneously with TMG, the beta-galactoside was excluded from the cells. Galactose enhanced the accumulation of TMG-6P. Glucose, mannose, lactose, or maltose plus arginine, was added to a suspension of TMG-6P-loaded cells of S. lactis ML3, elicited rapid expulsion of intracellular solute. The material recovered in the medium was exclusively free TMG. Expulsion of galactoside required both entry and metabolism of an appropriate sugar, and intracellular dephosphorylation of TMG-6P preceded efflux of TMG. The rate of dephosphorylation of TMG-6P by permeabilized cells was increased two-to threefold by adenosine 5'-triphosphate but was strongly inhibited by fluoride. S. lactis ML3 (DGr) was derived from S. lactis ML3 by positive selection for resistance to 2-deoxy-D-glucose and was defective in the enzyme IIMan component of the glucose:phosphotransferase system. Neither glucose nor mannose excluded TMG from cells of S. lactic ML3 (DGr), and these two sugars failed to elicit TMG expulsion from preloaded cells of the mutant strain. Accumulation of TMG-6P by S. lactis ML3 can be regulation by two independent mechanisms whose activities promote exclusion or expulsion of galactoside from the cell.
TI  - Proton motive force in growing Streptococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus cells under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Measurements of the electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions, which gives rise to the proton motive force (PMF), were carried out with growing Streptococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus cells. The facultative anaerobe was chosen in order to compare the PMF of cells growing aerobically and anaerobically. It was expected that during aerobic growth the cells would have a higher PMF than during anaerobic growth, because the H+-translocating ATPase (BF0F1) operates in the direction of H+ influx and ATP synthesis during respiration, whereas under anaerobic conditions the BF0F1 hydrolyzes glycolytically generated ATP and establishes the proton gradient by extruding H+. The electrical component of the PMF, delta psi, and the chemical gradient of H+, delta pH, were measured with radiolabeled tetraphenylphosphonium and benzoate ions. In both S. lactis and S. aureus cells, the PMF was constant during the exponential phase of batch growth and decreased in the stationary phase. In both species of bacteria, the exponential-phase PMF was not affected by varying the growth rate by adding different sugars to the medium. The relative contributions of delta psi and delta pH to the PMF, however, depended on the pH of the medium. The internal pH of S. aureus was constant at pH 7.4 to 7.6 under all conditions of growth tested. Under aerobic conditions, the delta psi of exponential phase S. aureus remained fairly constant at 160 to 170 mV. Thus, the PMF was 250 to 270 mV in cells growing aerobically in media at pH 6 and progressively lower in media of higher pH, reaching 195 to 205 mV at pH 7. Under anaerobic conditions, the delta psi ranged from 100 to 120 mV in cells at pH 6.3 to 7, resulting in a PMF of 150 to 140 mV. Thus, the mode of energy metabolism (i.e., respiration versus fermentation) and the pH of the medium are the two important factors influencing the PMF of these gram-positive cells during growth.
TI  - The importance of inorganic phosphate in regulation of energy metabolism of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - This paper is concerned with the control of glycolysis in nongrowing Streptococcus lactis 7962. Changes were measured in the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi), and adenine nucleotides following addition of glucose to cells that were in a starved condition. We find that intracellular Pi is a major factor in the control of glycolysis. In starved cells, the intracellular Pi concentration is high, greater than 40 mM. The large phosphoenolpyruvate pool that exists in starved cells can be explained as a result of inhibition of pyruvate kinase by the high concentration of Pi. On the other hand, in cells that are metabolizing glucose at a steady state rate, the cellular Pi concentration is low and pyruvate kinase is active. Upon depletion of glucose from the medium, the metabolite concentrations return to the values originally found in the starved state. This glucose depletion raises the intracellular Pi which again leads to inhibition of pyruvate kinase and the consequent buildup of the P-enolpyruvate pool.

TI  - The biological aspects of oral pathogenicity.
AB  - The bacteria in the oral region tend to localize in the form of plaque deposits on tooth surfaces and in gingival crevices. The "metabolic nature" of this complex flora focuses on the reversible interactions between the plaque flora and their environmental modifications. The environmental circumstances will influence the range of expression in situ for the plaque (oral) organisms. Then, it is suggested that the potential for caries induction or periodontal disease may develop when conditions approaching extremes of environment result in altered metabolism and antigenicity of particular oral organisms.
TI  - Preliminary attempts at bacteriocin typing of lactic streptococci.
AB  - Preliminary attempts at typing Streptococcus lactis, S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis and Streptococcus cremoris strains by bacteriocins (lactostrepcins) are presented. Among 106 strains used about 85% were sensitive to lactostreptocins. The highest proportion of bacteriocin-typing strains was observed in S. lactis species. Lactostrepcin-sensitive strains could be divided into 6 types. The results confirm some individual features of S. diacetylactis compared with S. lactis.

TI  - [Physiological characteristics of immobilized cells of Streptococcus lactis, Moscow State University strain].
AB  - Immobilized cells of Streptococcus lactis, strain MSU, synthesized nisin by 20--30 per cent of the possible maximum antibiotic production level. The immobilized cells of the Streptococcus synthesized nisin by 40--50 per cent probably at the expense of the cell nutrient pools and by 50--60 per cent at the expense of the medium nutrient consumption. The electron microphotographs showed that the cells of Str. lactis, strain MSU, preserved their usual appearance in the granules of polyacrylamide gel 24 hours after immobilization. In 3 weeks there were observed structural changes in the cell wall and inner membranes resulting in the cell lysis after presence in the granules for 3 months.
TI  - Galactose transport systems in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Galactose-grown cells of Streptococcus lactis ML3 have the capacity to transport  the growth sugar by two separate systems: (i) the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and (ii) an adenosine 5'-triphosphate-energized permease system. Proton-conducting uncouplers (tetrachlorosalicylanilide and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) inhibited galactose uptake by the permease system, but had no effect on phosphotransferase activity. Inhibition and efflux experiments conducted using beta-galactoside analogs showed that the galactose permease had a high affinity for galactose, methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, but possessed little or no affinity for glucose and lactose. The spatial configurations of hydroxyl groups at C-2, C-4, and C-6 were structurally important in facilitating interaction between the carrier and the sugar analog. Iodoacetate had no inhibitory effect on accumulation of galactose, methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, or lactose via the phosphotransferase system. However, after exposure of the cells to p-chloromercuribenzoate, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent uptake of lactose and methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside were reduced by 75 and 100%, respectively, whereas galactose phosphotransferase activity remained unchanged. The independent kinetic analysis of each transport system was achieved by the selective generation of the appropriate energy source (adenosine 5'-triphosphate or phosphoenolpyruvate) in vivo. The maximum rates of galactose transport by the two systems were similar, but the permease system exhibited a 10-fold greater affinity for sugar than did the phosphotransferase system.
TI  - Galactose fermentation by Streptococcus lactis and Streptococcus cremoris: pathways, products, and regulation.
AB  - All of the lactic streptococci examined except Streptococcus lactis ML8 fermented galactose to lactate, formate, acetate, and ethanol. The levels of pyruvate-formate lyase and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated and reduced, respectively, in galactose-grown cells compared with glucose- or lactose-grown cells. Reduced intracellular levels of both the lactate dehydrogenase activator (fructose, 1,6-diphosphate) and pyruvate-formate lyase inhibitors (triose phosphates) appeared to be the main factors involved in the diversion of lactate to the other products. S. lactis ML8 produced only lactate from galactose, apparently due to the maintenance of high intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-diphosphate and triose phosphates. The growth rates of all 10 Streptococcus cremoris strains examined decreased markedly with galactose concentrations below about 30 mM. This effect appeared to be correlated with uptake predominantly by the low-affinity galactose phosphotransferase system and initial metabolism via the D-tagatose 6-phosphate pathway. In contrast, with four of the five S. lactis strains examined, galactose uptake and initial metabolism involved more extensive use of the high-affinity galactose permease and Leloir pathway. With these strains the relative flux of galactose through the alternate pathways would depend on the exogenous galactose concentration.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of the hypothiocyanite anion towards Streptococcus lactis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - It has been suggested that the antibacterial activity of the lactoperoxidase/thiocyanate/hydrogen peroxide system is due to the hypothiocyanite anion. Relatively pure solutions of hypothiocyanite can be prepared using an immobilized enzyme. These preparations have been used to examine the effect of the anion on the growth and on the membranes of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus lactis. Escherichia coli is killed in the presence of the anion whereas the effect on Streptococcus lactis is only bacteriostatic. As similar effects have been noted with the lactoperoxidase/thiocyanate/hydrogen peroxide system the hypothesis that the action of the two systems is similar is supported.
TI  - High-frequency conjugation associated with Streptococcus lactis donor cell aggregation.
AB  - Conjugal transfer of the Streptococcus lactis 712 lactose plasmid was found to occur at a low frequency. Variants of this plasmid were selected which had much greater donor abilities and which also exhibited an unusual cell aggregation phenotype.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of genetic information in group N streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis strains ML3 and C(2)O and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis strains DRC3, 11007, and WM(4) were found to transfer lactose-fermenting ability to LM0230, an S. lactis C2 lactose-negative (Lac(-)) derivative which is devoid of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Lactose-positive streptomycin-resistant (Lac(+) Str(r)) recombinants were found when the Lac(+) Str(s) donor was mixed with Lac(-) Str(r) LM0230 in solid-surface matings. Transduction and transformation were ruled out as the mechanism of genetic exchange in strains ML3, DRC3, 11007, and WM(4), nor was reversion responsible for the high number of Lac(+) Str(r) recombinants. Furthermore, chloroform treatment of the donor prevented the appearance of recombinants, indicating that transfer of lactose-fermenting ability required viable cell-to-cell contact. Strain C(2)O demonstrated transduction as well as conjugation. Transfer of plasmid DNA during conjugation for all strains was confirmed by demonstrating the presence of plasmid DNA in the transconjugants by using agarose gel electrophoresis. In some instances, a cryptic plasmid was transferred in conjunction with the lactose plasmid by using strains DRC3, 11007, and WM(4). In S. lactis C2 x LM0230 matings, the Str(r) marker was transferred from LM0230 to C2, suggesting conjugal transfer of chromosomal DNA. The results confirm conjugation as another mechanism of genetic exchange occurring in dairy starter cultures.
TI  - [Adsorption of the antibiotic, nisin, to Streptococcus lactis cells].
AB  - Nizin is produced by Str. lactis, strain MSU. During biosynthesis it is excreted  into the fermentation broth and gradually adsorbed on the organism cells. This was confirmed by experiments with an inactive variant of Str. lactis IIa. The cells of this culture adsorbed nizin from "active" fermentation broth. Adsorption of nizin depended on pH of the medium; at pH 2,3 the cells did not adsorbe the antibiotic and at pH 6.6 the amount of the antibiotic adsorbed by the cells was maximum.
TI  - Proton motive force during growth of Streptococcus lactis cells.
AB  - Experiments with the aerotolerant anaerobe Streptococcus lactis provide the opportunity for determining the proton motive force (Deltap) in dividing cells. The two components of Deltap, DeltaPsi (the transmembrane potential) and DeltapH (the chemical gradient of H(+)), were determined by the accumulation of radiolabeled tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP(+)) and benzoate ions. The DeltaPsi was calibrated with the K(+) diffusion potential in starved, valinomycin-treated cells. With resting, glycolyzing cells, the Deltap was measured also by the accumulation of the non-metabolizable sugar thiomethyl-beta-galactoside (TMG). In resting cells the Deltap, calculated either by adding DeltaPsi and ZDeltapH or from the levels of TMG, was relatively constant between pH 5 to 7, decreasing from 160 to 150 mV and decreasing further to 100 mV at pH 8.0. With the TPP(+) probe for DeltaPsi, we confirmed our previous finding that the K(+) ions dissipate DeltaPsi and increase DeltapH, whereas Na(+) ions have little effect on DeltaPsi and no effect on DeltapH. [(3)H]TPP(+) and [(14)C]benzoate were added during exponential phase to S. lactis cells growing at pH 5 to 7 at 28 degrees C in a defined medium with glucose as energy source. As with resting cells, the DeltapH and DeltaPsi were dependent on the pH of the medium. At pH 5.1, the DeltapH was equivalent to 60 mV (alkaline inside) and decreased to 25 mV at pH 6.8. The DeltaPsi increased from 83 mV (negative inside) at pH 5.1 to 108 mV at pH 6.8. The Deltap, therefore, was fairly constant between pH 5 and 7, decreasing from 143 to 133 mV. The values for Deltap in growing cells, just as in resting cells, are consistent with a system in which the net efflux of H(+) ions is effected by a membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatase and glycolytically generated adenosine triphosphate. The data suggest that in both growing and resting cells the pH of the medium and its K(+) concentration are the two principal factors that determine the relative contribution of DeltapH and DeltaPsi to the proton motive force.

TI  - Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in group N streptococci.
AB  - Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was detected in whole cells but not in cell-free  extracts of Streptococcus lactis. However, the three component enzymes (pyruvate decarboxylase, lipoate acetyltransferase and lipoyl dehydrogenase) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were identified in the cell-free extracts. Whole cells of the three species of group N streptococci formed acetoin and diacetyl only after the pathway forming acetate had become saturated. S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC2 formed more acetoin and diacetyl and less acetate from pyruvate than did S. lactis C10. Strains C10 and DRC2 were able to form acetoin via alpha-acetolactate or diacetyl and to convert acetoin to butane-2,3-diol. S. cremoris HP was able to form acetoin only via alpha-acetolactate and could not convert acetoin to butane-2,3-diol.
TI  - Chemical changes in bovine colostrum preserved with formalin or by fermentation.
AB  - Fresh bovine colstrum from second and third milkings postpartum was inoculated with either a yogurt culture or Streptococcus lactis or preserved with .1% formalin in two separate experiments. There was a rapid decrease in pH of the fermented samples which corresponded to decreased lactose concentrations and increased lactate and titratable acidity. Titratable acidity in the fermented colostrums increased further after 10 days from the production of volatile fatty acids, but pH did not decrease. The pH of the yogurt fermentations in Experiment 2 decreased to 3.8, and the continued increase in titratable acidity was from lactic acid rather than volatile fatty acids. The lowest pH of all other fermentations was 4.1. The extent of metabolism of the formalin-preserved colostrum was much less than for the colostrum fermented by either culture.
TI  - Resistance of 17 mesophilic lactic Streptococcus bacteriophages to pasteurization and spray-drying.
AB  - For 17 phages active against Streptococcus cremoris, Str. lactis and Str. lactis  subsp. diacetylactis, the killing efficiency of pasteurization (log No/N) at 72 degrees C for 15 s in skim-milk showed large variations from greater than 6 to 0; the efficienty of killing during spray-drying ranged from 3.7 to 0.2 and phages survived well storage of milk powder at room temperature. Destruction in a heat exchanger was found to be greater than that calculated from biphasic curves obtained by heating phages in sealed ampoules. No relationship was established between lytic classification of phages and their heat resistance.
TI  - Effect of prostaglandin E1-induced elevation of cyclic AMP on glucose repression  in the lactic streptococci.
AB  - Cyclic adenosine 3', 5' -monophosphate (cAMP) activity was observed in Streptococcus lactis C2, Streptococcus cremoris C10, Streptococcus diacetlactis 18-16, and Streptococcus thermophilus C3. In vitro assays of cell-free extracts obtaianed from S. lactis C2 showed that the cAMP-associated enzymes adenyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase were also present. In vitro experiments showed that prostaglandin E1 (PGE) stimulation of adenyl cyclase increased cAMP concentrations approximately fivefold, and in vivo studies showed that PGE treatment of S. lactis C2 increased intracellular cAMP concentrations twofold. Futhermore, PGE-induced elevation of intracellular cAMP levels was shown to prevent the repression of ss-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase synthesis by glucose.
TI  - Evaluation of lactic acid Streptococci for the preparation of frozen concentrated starter cultures.
AB  - Eight strains of Streptococcus diacetilactis and Streptococcus lactis were examined for viability, growth rate, lactic acid and diacetyl production in milk and proteolytic activity before and after freezing at --30 degrees C. Concentrations of yeast autolysate, peptone, lactose and citrate as well as the usefulness of milk and whey culture media for active biomass production were investigated. After freezing and storage at --30 degrees C, with the use of non-fat milk as a cryoprotective agent, high survival and endocellular proteolytic activity of the frozen concentrate was achieved. S. diacetilactis sp. and S. lactis 115 were shown to be more biologically active than other strains. Their physiological properties remained unaffected by freezing.
TI  - Studies on the relationship between glycerophosphoglycolipids and lipoteichoic acids. IV. Trigalactosylglycerophospho-acylkojibiosyldiacylglycerol and related compounds from Streptococcus lactis Kiel 42172.

The predominant one was composed of D-galactose, D-glucose, glycerol, acyl groups and phosphorus in a molar ratio of approx. 3 : 2 : 2 : 3 : 1.

By HF hydrolysis the other compounds were shown to be in the main also derivatives of GroP leads to 6Glc(alpha 1 leads to 2), acyl leads to 6Glc(alpha 1 leads to 3)acyl2Gro but they released as water-soluble glycosides Gal(alpha 1 leads to 2)Gro, Gal(alpha 1 leads to 3)Gro, Gal(alpha 1 leads to 3)Gro(2 comes from 1 alpha Gal), Gal(alpha 1 leads to 6)Gal(alpha 1 leads to 3)Gro and Gal(alpha 1 leads to 6)Gal-(alpha 1 leads to 6)Gal(alpha 1 leads to 3)Gro(2 comes from 1 alpha Gal), respectively. In the lipid extract Glc(alpha 1 leads to 2), acyl leads to 6Glc(alpha 1 leads to 3)acyl2Gro and GroP leads to 6Glc(alpha 1 leads to 2), acyl leads to 6Glc(alpha 1 leads to 3) acyl2Gro were also observed. This set of compounds is proposed to constitute a biosynthetic series reflecting the individual steps in the synthesis of the lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus lactis Kiel 42172 which is made up by the same lipid anchor and a non-classical poly(galabiosyl, galactosyl glycerophosphate)-chain (Koch, H.U. and Fischer, W. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 5275--5281).
TI  - Lactose metabolism in Streptococcus lactis: phosphorylation of galactose and glucose moieties in vivo.
AB  - Starved cells of Streptococcus lactis ML3 grown previously on lactose, galactose, or maltose were devoid of adenosine 5'-triphosphate contained only three glycolytic intermediates: 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The three metabolites (total concentration, ca 40 mM) served as the intracellular PEP potential for sugar transport via PEP-dependent phosphotransferase systems. When accumulation of [14C]lactose by iodoacetate-inhibited starved cells was abolished within 1 s of commencement of transport, a phosphorylated disaccharide was identified by autoradiography. The compound was isolated by ion-exchange (borate) chromatography, and enzymatic analysis showed that the derivative was 6-phosphoryl-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl (1 leads to 4')-alpha-D-glucopyranose (lactose 6-phosphate). After maximum lactose uptake (ca. 15 mM in 15 s) the cells were collected by membrane filtration and extracted with trichloroacetic acid. Neither free nor phosphorylated lactose was detected in cell extracts, but enzymatic analysis revealed high levels of galactose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate. The starved organisms rapidly accumulated glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside in phosphorylated form to intracellular concentrations of 32, 32, 42, and 38.5 mM, respectively. In contrast, maximum accumulation of lactose (ca. 15 mM) was only 40 to 50% that of the monosaccharides. From the stoichiometry of PEP-dependent lactose transport and the results of enzymatic analysis, it was concluded that (i) ca. 60% of the PEP potential was utilized via the lactose phosphotransferase system for phosphorylation of the galactosyl moiety of the disaccharide, and (ii) the residual potential (ca. 40%) was consumed during phosphorylation of the glucose moiety.
TI  - Properties and function of fumarate reductase (NADH) in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - The fumarate reductase (NADH) present in cell-free extracts of S. lactis C10 was  purified approximately 100-fed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Teric X-10, and some of the properties of this partially purified enzyme were characterized. Fumarate was able to act as a terminal electron acceptor and decreased the amount of lactate formed and oxygen used during the metabolism of pyruvate by resting cells of S. lactis. Anaerobic growth of S. lactis on glycerol was not observed and fumarate reduction was not coupled with glycerol-3-phosphate oxidation.
TI  - Partial characterization of a new C3-type capsule-dissolving phage of Streptococcus cremoris.
AB  - A viscous, ropy, sour milk product, called 'viili,' is produced in Finland. Capsule-forming strains of Streptococcus cremoris are the typical starters for this product. Occasionally fermentation fails and results in a non-ropy clot. The reasons for these failures, however, are obscure. In one batch of spoiled 'viili,' a new C3-type bacteriophage, termed KSY1, was isolated. The head of the phage was about 230 nm long and about 50 nm wide and the tail was 35 nm long and carried a complex collar structure. Upon infection of a number of encapsulated cultures of S. cremoris with KSY1, the cocci, though not serving as a host of the phage, lost their capsules. A capsuleless strain, S. cremoris 249, served as a host. The latent period was about 150 min and the average burst size 80. The bouyant density of KSYI1 was 1.436 g/cm3.

TI  - Membrane H+ conductance of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Membrane conductance to H+ was measured in the anaerobic bacterium Streptoccus lactis by a pulse technique employing a low driving force (0.1 pH unit; 6 mV). Over the pH range of 3.7 to 8.5, a constant value for passive H+ conductance was observed, corresponding to 0.2 mumol of H+/s per p/ unit per g, dry weight (1.6 microS/cm2 of surface area). The pH insensitivity of this low basal H+ conductance supports the idea that a circulation of protons can mediate highly efficiency engery transductions across the membranes of bacteria.
TI  - The distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups D and N.
AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
TI  - [Effect of KH2PO4 on Streptococcus lactis growth and nisin synthesis when the medium is kept at a constant pH].
AB  - When the pH of the medium was maintained at the level of 6.6--6.8 and the content of KH2PO4 in it was decreased, the biosynthetic activity of Streptococcus lactis, strain MGU, became lower. The culture assimilated low quantities of phosphorus from KH2PO4 at a high concentration of this salt in the medium; presumably, the culture required large quantities of potassium ions. If the pH of the medium is maintained at a constant value, the fermentation can be stopped 21 hr after the beginning of cultivation of Str. lactis, strain MGU.
TI  - [Dynamics of nisin accumulation in a culture of Streptococcus lactis].
AB  - The dynamics of nisine accumulation by its producer Streptococcus lactis, str. MSU was studied. In the course of the producer cultivation on the liquid nutrient medium there was a correlation between total, cellular and filtrate nysine. The content of cellular nysine increased gradually to reach maximum by the 6th day of the strain cultivation. The content of filtrate nisine reached maximum on the 2nd day and declined two-fold by the 7th day of cultivation.
TI  - Change from homo- to heterolactic fermentation by Streptococcus lactis resulting  from glucose limitation in anaerobic chemostat cultures.
AB  - Lactic streptococci, classically regarded as homolactic fermenters of glucose and lactose, became heterolactic when grown with limiting carbohydrate concentrations in a chemostat. At high dilution rates (D) with excess glucose present, about 95% of the fermented sugar was converted to l-lactate. However, as D was lowered and glucose became limiting, five of the six strains tested changed to a heterolactic fermentation such that at D = 0.1 h(-1) as little as 1% of the glucose was converted to l-lactate. The products formed after this phenotypic change in fermentation pattern were formate, acetate, and ethanol. The level of lactate dehydrogenase, which is dependent upon ketohexose diphosphate for activity, decreased as fermentation became heterolactic with Streptococcus lactis ML(3). Transfer of heterolactic cells from the chemostat to buffer containing glucose resulted in the nongrowing cells converting nearly 80% of the glucose to l-lactate, indicating that fine control of enzyme activity is an important factor in the fermentation change. These nongrowing cells metabolizing glucose had elevated (ca. twofold) intracellular fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentrations ([FDP](in)) compared with those in the glucose-limited heterolactic cells in the chemostat. [FDP](in) was monitored during the change in fermentation pattern observed in the chemostat when glucose became limiting. Cells converting 95 and 1% of the glucose to l-lactate contained 25 and 10 mM [FDP](in), respectively. It is suggested that factors involved in the change to heterolactic fermentation include both [FDP](in) and the level of lactate dehydrogenase.
TI  - Characterization of groups N and D streptococci isolated from rumen fluids.
AB  - Twelve strains of streptococci of serological groups N and D were isolated from rumen fluids of nine cows on four rations although both groups were not isolated from the same animal. The twelve were representative of a larger number of streptococci isolated by enrichment in milk. Generally, the physiological characteristics of the isolates indicated members of the lactic or enterococcus groups; however, several were atypical in one or more of the tolerance tests. Physiologically typical Streptococcus lactis but not S. cremoris, were isolated.
TI  - Influence of the lactose plasmid on the metabolism of galactose by Streptococcus  lactis.
AB  - Streptococcus lactis strain DR1251 was capable of growth on lactose and galactose with generation times, at 30 degrees C, of 42 and 52 min, respectively. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase activity for lactose and galactose was induced during growth on either substrate. This activity had an apparent K(m) of 5 x 10(-5) M for lactose and 2 x 10(-2) M for galactose. beta-d-Phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase activity was synthesized constitutively by these cells. Strain DR1251 lost the ability to grow on lactose at a high frequency when incubated at 37 degrees C with glucose as the growth substrate. Loss of ability to metabolize lactose was accompanied by the loss of a 32-megadalton plasmid, pDR(1), and Lac(-) isolates did not revert to a Lac(+) phenotype. Lac(-) strains were able to grow on galactose but with a longer generation time. Galactose-grown Lac(-) strains were deficient in beta-d-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase activity and phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase activity for both lactose and galactose. There was also a shift from a predominantly homolactic to a heterolactic fermentation and a fivefold increase in galactokinase activity, relative to the Lac(+) parent strain grown on galactose. These results suggest that S. lactis strain DR1251 metabolizes galactose primarily via the tagatose-6-phosphate pathway, using a lactose phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase activity to transport this substrate into the cell. Lac(-) derivatives of strain DR1251, deficient in the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase activity, appeared to utilize galactose via the Leloir pathway.

TI  - Acyldiglucosyldiacylglycerol-containing lipoteichoic acid with a poly(3-O-galabiosyl-2-O-galactosyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphate) chain from Streptococcus lactis Kiel 42172.
AB  - The lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus lactis Kiel 42172 was isolated. The lipid  portions were released by HF and were established to be 3-O-[O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl]-2-O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphate, they are joined by phosphodiester bonds nosyl)]glycerol. The repeating units of the hydrophilic chain were established to be 3-O-[O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl]-2-O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphate; they are joined by phosphodiester bonds at carbon atom 6 of the galabiosyl residues. The innermost unit is linked to the glycolipid by a phosphodiester presumably at C-6 of the outer glucosyl moiety. The hydrophilic chain is 7.4--11.8 units in length, measuring 12--19 nm is extended conformation. The content of 2.7--2.96 acyl groups per 2 glucosyl residues indicates that 70--96% of the glycolipid consists of acyldiglucosyldiacylglycerol. The novel poly(glycosylgly-cerophosphate) structure provided for the first time the oplipoteichoic acids are the sn-1 isomer which has previously been suggested from biosynthetic studies (Glaser, L., & Lindsay, B. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 59, 1131--1136).
TI  - In vivo regulation of glycolysis and characterization of sugar: phosphotransferase systems in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Two novel procedures have been used to regulate, in vivo, the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from glycolysis in Streptococcus lactis ML3. In the first procedure, glucose metabolism was specifically inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Autoradiographic and enzymatic analyses showed that the cells contained glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, and triose phosphates. Dithiothreitol reversed the p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibition, and these intermediates were rapidly and quantitatively transformed into 3- and 2-phosphoglycerates plus PEP. The three intermediates were not further metabolized and constituted the intracellular PEP potential. The second procedure simply involved starvation of the organisms. The starved cells were devoid of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose- 1,6-diphosphate, and triose phosphates but contained high levels of 3- and 2-phosphoglycerates and PEP (ca. 40 mM in total). The capacity to regulate PEP formation in vivo permitted the characterization of glucose and lactose phosphotransferase systems in physiologically intact cells. Evidence has been obtained for "feed forward" activation of pyruvate kinase in vivo by phosphorylated intermediates formed before the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in the glycolytic sequence. The data suggest that pyruvate kinase (an allosteric enzyme) plays a key role in the regulation of glycolysis and phosphotransferase system functions in S. lactis ML3.

TI  - [Nisin formation by immobilized cells of the lactic acid bacterium, Streptococcus lactis].
AB  - The problem of microbial cell immobilization at present attracts the ever increasing attention of the scientists, since such organisms may be the source of various enzymes. Production of nizin by the immobilized cells of Str. lactis was studied. It was found that the cells of Str. lactis incorporated into polyacrylamide gel produced nizit on definite media. Still, the amount of the antibiotic was 2-3 times lower than in case of using free cells. The effect of a number of factors on the process of immobilization was studied and the influence of some factors, such as temperature, pH, aeration on nizin synthesis by the immobilized cells of the streptococcus was elucidated. Optimal conditions for nizin biosynthesis by the immobilized cells of Str. lactis were developed.
TI  - Aerobic growth thermograms of Streptococcus lactis obtained with a complex medium containing glucose.
AB  - With different culturing methods both simple and complex thermograms were obtained with Streptococcus lactis grown aerobically in a complex medium containing growth-limiting concentrations of glucose. The thermogram profiles have been interpreted in relation to growth rate, glucose degradation, and molar growth yields calculated for different time intervals during growth.
TI  - Lactostrepcins--acid bacteriocins produced by lactic streptococci.
AB  - All 47 non-nisin producing strains of Streptococcus lactis and 12/13 strains of Str. lactis subsp. diacetylactis examined produced bacteriocins, for which the term lactostrepcins is suggested. Seven strains of Str. cremoris examined produced no bacteriocins active against 3 lactic streptococci strains used as indicators. The strains examined were divided into 3 groups: I, those producing lactostrepcins active against only one streptomycin resistant mutant of Str. lactis 60 indicator strain; II, those producing lactostrepcins active against all 3 indicator strains; III, those not producing lactostrepcins active against the indicator strains employed. The lactostrepcins were sensitive to various proteolytic enzymes and to phospholipase D, but retained full or partial activity after dialysis. Most of the bacteriocins studied were fully active only within the pH range 4.2--5.0 and were reversibly inactivated at pH 7.0 or 8.0. Results suggested occurrence of 4 different lactostrepcins. The lactostrepcins produced by all group I strains were the same, but there were differences among the lactostrepcins produced by group II strains. Lactostrepcins killed some beta-haemolytic streptococci and some strains of Lactobacillus helveticus. One of the lactostrepcins was also active against certain Leuconostoc strains, but not against other Leuconostoc strains, nor against L. helveticus or other Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - On the relationship between glycerophosphoglycolipids and lipoteichoic acids of gram-positive bacteria. III. Di(glycerophospho)-acylkojibiosyldiacylglycerol and related compounds from Streptococcus lactis NCDO 712.
AB  - 1. Streptococcus lactis NCDO 712 contains at lease three unusually polar glycerophosphoglycolipids. One of them was composed of D-glucose, glycerol, fatty acid ester, and phosphorus in the molar ratio of approx. 2 : 3 : 3 : 2. The structure was established as 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-[6-(sn-glycero-1-phospho-3-sn-glycero-1-phospho)-alpha-D-glucop yranosyl-(1 leads to 2)-(6-O-acyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)]-glycerol. 2. The second glycerophosphoglycolipid was shown to have the same core structure but is lacking the carbohydrate-linked fatty acid. The third glycero-phosphoglycolipid is a glycosylated derivative of the first one bearing an alpha-galactosyl residue at position 2 of the inner glycolipid-linked glycerophosphate moiety. 3. These novel phosphoglycolipids are considered to be the so far missing link between simple glycerophosphoglycolipids and lipoteichoic acids of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Lytic enzymes produced by Actinomyces levoris].
AB  - The composition of the enzyme complex produced by Actinomyces levoris which exhibits lytic action on the cell walls of Streptococcus lactis was studied by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, ion exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. The complex was found to contain at least seven enzymes having different isoelectric points and substrate specificity. The enzymes were divided into three groups. (1) The enzyme with pI 10.2 seems to be a specific glucosidase; it possesses a high activity of the cell wall lysis and lacks a proteolytic activity. (2) The enzymes with pI 9.2 and 9.0 are, apparently, specific lytic proteases; they display both lytic and proteolytic activities. (3) The enzymes with pI 10.0, 9.5, 5.7 and 4.2 are, presumably, non-specific lytic proteases; they have a low lytic activity and a high proteolytic activity.
TI  - Catabolite inhibition and sequential metabolism of sugars by Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Growth of galactose-adapted cells of Streptococcus lactis ML(3) in a medium containing a mixture of glucose, galactose, and lactose was characterized initially by the simultaneous metabolism of glucose and lactose. Galactose was not significantly utilized until the latter sugars had been exhausted from the medium. The addition of glucose or lactose to a culture of S. lactis ML(3) growing exponentially on galactose caused immediate inhibition of galactose utilization and an increase in growth rate, concomitant with the preferential metabolism of the added sugar. Under nongrowing conditions, cells of S. lactis ML(3) grown previously on galactose metabolized the three separate sugars equally rapidly. However, cells suspended in buffer containing a mixture of glucose plus galactose or lactose plus galactose again consumed glucose or lactose preferentially. The rate of galactose metabolism was reduced by approximately 95% in the presence of the inhibitory sugar, but the maximum rate of metabolism was resumed upon exhaustion of glucose or lactose from the system. When presented with a mixture of glucose and lactose, the resting cells metabolized both sugars simultaneously. Lactose, glucose, and a non-metabolizable glucose analog (2-deoxy-d-glucose) prevented the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent uptake of thiomethyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (TMG), but the accumulation of TMG, like galactose metabolism, commenced immediately upon exhaustion of the metabolizable sugars from the medium. Growth of galactose-adapted cells of the lactose-defective variant S. lactis 7962 in the triple-sugar medium was characterized by the sequential metabolism of glucose, galactose, and lactose. Growth of S. lactis ML(3) and 7962 in the triple-sugar medium occurred without apparent diauxie, and for each strain the patterns of sequential sugar metabolism under growing and nongrowing conditions were identical. Fine control of the activities of preexisting enzyme systems by catabolite inhibition may afford a satisfactory explanation for the observed sequential utilization of sugars by these two organisms.
TI  - Improved lysis of group N streptococci for isolation and rapid characterization of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - Procedures for effective cellular lysis and plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation from group N streptococci were developed. Cells were grown at 32 degrees C for 4 h in a modified Elliker broth containing 20 mM DL-threonine. After cellular digestion with 2 mg of lysozyme per ml for 7 min at 37 degrees C, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate exposure resulted in complete and immediate lysis. Lactose (Lac) plasmid species in Streptococcus lactis C2 and S. cremoris B1 (30 and 37 megadaltons, respectively) were demonstrated upon examination of DNA from the cleared lysates by agarose gel electrophoresis. Increasing the lysozyme treatment to 20 min or more resulted in loss of the Lac plasmid, whereas other resident plasmids were unaffected and demonstrable in agarose gels. Diethylpyrocarbonate added before lysis prevented Lac plasmid loss in 20-min lysozyme-treated cells, but was not effective after 40 min of lysozyme treatment. The results suggested that endogenous nuclease activity during the lysozyme treatment period initiated Lac plasmid DNA loss. The development of an efficient lysis procedure for the group N streptococci allowed rapid identification and characterization of plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid composition of S. lactis C2 and S. cremoris B1, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, compared favorably to previous electron microscopic observations.
TI  - Peptide utilization by group N streptococci.
AB  - The rate of glycylleucine uptake by Group N streptococci varied widely. One strain of Streptococcus cremoris did not transport the dipeptide or utilize tripeptides. In peptide-utilizing strains, amino acid, dipeptide and tripeptide transport were distinct, although dipeptides inhibited tripeptide utilization. Specificity determinants for peptide transport and utilization were similar to those reported in Gram-negative bacteria. Peptide utilization in S. lactis was not completely dependent on the transport of intact peptides.

UV irradiation did not produce any isolate completely devoid of diacetyl reductase activity, though, 99.5% loss in activity could be achieved. NTG treatment proved to be more effective and seven survivors exhibiting complete loss of diacetyl reductase activity were recovered. These altered characteristics were retained on repeated subculturing.

TI  - Species differences and effect of incubation time on lactic streptococcal intracellular proteolytic enzyme activity.
AB  - Ruptured cells of Streptococcus lactis C2, S. cremoris ML 1 and a lactose-negative proteinase-negative (Lac-Prt-) mutant of S. lactis C2 (LMO220) were fractionated into the soluble, particulate, and ribosome fractions by differential centrifugation. S. lactis C2 possessed higher activity of intracellular proteinase, alanylglycinase, particulate associated dipeptidase and ribosome associated dipeptidase and ribosome associated dipeptidase than did S. cremoris ML1. LMO220 was lower in intracellular proteinase and dipeptidase activity and lower in ribosome associated dipeptidase activity than was the parent strain C2. Particulate associated dipeptidase activity was substantially higher in the mutant cells. Extending incubation times from 5 to 24 and 32 h reduced intracellular proteinase and ribosome associated dipeptidase activity in S. lactis C2 and S. cremoris ML1. Soluble alanylglycinase activity and particulate associated dipeptidase activity of ML1 were reduced drastically after 24-h incubation.
TI  - Obligatory coupling between proton entry and the synthesis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Proton influx was measured after imposition of an electrochemical potential difference for protons (delta muH+) across the cell membrane of the anaerobe, Streptococcus lactis. As delta muH+ was increased, there was an approximately parallel increase in proton entry, until delta muH+ attained 175 to 200 mV. At this point, a new pathway became available for proton entry, allowing an abrupt increase in both the rate and extent of H+ influx. This gated response depended upon the value of delta muH+ itself, and not upon the value of either the membrane potential or the pH gradient. For delta muH+ above 175 to 200 mV, elevated proton entry occurred only in cells having a functional membrane-bound Ca2+-stimulated, Mg2+stimulated adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3). When present, elevated proton entry coincided with the appearance of net synthesis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate catalyzed by this adenosine 5'-triphosphatase. These observations demonstrate that membrane-bound adenosine 5'-triphosphatase catalyzes an obligatory coupling between the inward movement of protons and synthesis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate.
TI  - [Influence of pH on nisin production by Streptococcus lactis cultures].
AB  - The pH effect on the nisine biosynthesis during the cultivation of Streptococcus  lactis was studied at pH 5,8 6,7 and 7,2. The pH maintenance at the specified level did not stimulate the growth of Str. lactis, did not increase the total yield of nisine and did not produce a significant effect on the level or cellular nisine. This indicates an important physiological difference between the culture-nisine producer described by Hirsh and our culture Str. lactis, str. Moscow University.

TI  - Fructose 1,6-diphosphate-activated L-lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus lactis: kinetic properties and factors affecting activation.
AB  - The L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (L-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) of Streptococcus lactis C10, like that of other streptococci, was activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP). The enzyme showed some activity in the absence of FDP, with a pH optimum of 8.2; FDP decreased the Km for both pyruvate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and shifted the pH optimum to 6.9. Enzyme activity showed a hyperbolic response to both NADH and pyruvate in all the buffers tried except phosphate buffer, in which the response to increasing NADH was sigmoidal. The FDP concentration required for half-maximal velocity (FDP0.5V) was markedly influenced by the nature of the assay buffer used. Thus the FDP0.5V was 0.002 mM in 90 mM triethanolamine buffer, 0.2 mM in 90 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethanemaleate buffer, and 4.4 mM in 90 mM phosphate buffer. Phosphate inhibition of FDP binding is not a general property of streptococcal lactate dehydrogenase, since the FDP0.5V value for S. faecalis 8043 lactate dehydrogenase was not increased by phosphate. The S. faecalis and S. lactis lactate dehydrogenases also differed in that Mn2+ enhanced FDP binding in S. faecalis but had no effect on the S. lactis dehydrogenase. The FDP concentration (12 to 15 mM) found in S. lactis cells during logarithmic growth on a high-carbohydrate (3% lactose) medium would be adequate to give almost complete activation of the lactate dehydrogenase even if the high FDP0.5V value found in 90 mM phosphate were similar to the FDP requirement in vivo.
TI  - Effects of potassium ions on the electrical and pH gradients across the membrane  of Streptococcus lactis cells.
AB  - Bacteria transduce and conserve energy at the plasma membrane in the form of an electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions (deltap). Energized cells of Streptococcus lactis accumulate K+ ions presumably in exchange for H+. We reasoned that if the movement of H+ is limited, then an increase in H+ efflux, effected by potassium transport inward, should result in changes in the steady-state deltap. We determined the electrical gradient (deltapsi) from the fluorescence of a membrane potential-sensitive cyanine dye, and the chemical H+ gradient (deltapH) from the distribution of a weak acid. The deltap was also determined independently from the accumulation levels of the non-metabolizable sugar thiomethyl-beta-galactoside. KCl addition to cells fermenting glucose or arginine at pH 5 changed the deltap very little, but lowered the deltapsi, while increasing the deltapH. At pH 7, the deltapH only increased slightly; thus, the decrease in deltapsi, effected by addition of potassium ions, resulted in a lowered steady-state deltap. These effects were shown not to be due to swelling or shrinking of the cells. Thus, in these nongrowing cells, under conditions of energy utilization for the active transport of K+, the components of deltap can vary depending on the limitations on the net movement of protons.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate and 2-phosphoglycerate: endogenous energy source(s) for sugar accumulation by starved cells of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - In the absence of an exogenous energy source, galactose-grown cells of Streptococcus lactis ML3 rapidly accumulated thiomethyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (TMG) and 2-deoxyglucose to intracellular concentrations of 40 to 50 mM. Starved cells maintained the capacity for TMG uptake for many hours, and accumulation of the beta-galactoside was insensitive to proton-conducting ionophores (tetrachlorosalicylanilide and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) and sulfydryl group reagents including iodoacetate and N-ethylmaleimide. Fluorimetric analysis of glycolytic intermediates in extracts prepared from starved cells revealed (a) high intracellular levels of phosphoenolpyruvate (13 mM; PEP) and 2-phosphoglycerate (approximately 39 mM; 2-PG), but an absence of other metabolites including glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and triosephosphates. The following criteria showed PEP (and 2-PG) to be the endogenous energy source for TMG accumulation by the phosphotransferase system: the intracellular concentrations of PEP and 2-PG decreased with concomitant uptake of TMG, and a close correlation was observed between maximum accumulation of the beta-galactoside and the total available concentration of the two intermediates; TMG accumulated as an anionic derivative, which after extraction and incubation with alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) formed the original analogue; fluoride inhibition of 2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolyase (EC 4.2.1.11) prevented the conversion of 2-PG to PEP, and uptake of TMG by the starved cells was reduced by 80%; and the stoichiometric ratio [TMG] accumulated/[PEP] consumed was almost unity (0.93). In cells metabolizing glucose, all intermediates listed in (a) and (b) were found. Upon exhaustion of glucose from the medium, the metabolites in (b) were not longer detectable, while the intracellular concentrations of PEP and 2-PG increased to the levels previously observed in starved cells. The glycolytic intermediates in (b) are all in vitro heterotropic effectors of pyruvate kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from S. lactis ML3. It is suggested that the capacity of starved cells to maintain high intracellular concentrations of PEP and 2-PG is a consequence of decreased in vivo activity of this key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis.
TI  - Inorganic salts resistance associated with a lactose-fermenting plasmid in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Present evidence indicates that lactose metabolism in group N streptococci is linked to plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid. Lactose-positive (Lac+) Streptococcus lactis and lactose-negative (Lac-) derivatives were examined for their resistance to various inorganic ions. Lac+ S. lactis strains ML3, M18, and C2 were found more resistant to arsenate (7.5- to 60.2-fold), arsenite (2.25- to 3.0-fold), and chromate (6.6- to 9.4-fold), but more sensitive to copper (10.0- to 13.3-fold) than their Lac- derivatives. These results suggested that genetic information for resistance and/or sensitivity to these ions resides on the "lactose plasmid." Kinetics of ultraviolet irradiation inactivation of transducing ability for lactose metabolism and arsenate resistance confirmed the plasmid location of the two markers. Lac+ transductants from S. lactis C2 received genetic determinants for resistance to arsenate, arsenite, and chromate but not for copper sensitivity. In this case, resistance markers were lost when the transductants became Lac- but the derivatives remained copper resistant. The resistant markers for arsenate and arsenite could not be identified as separate genetic loci, but chromate resistance and copper sensitivity markers were found to be independent genetic loci. The "lactose plasmid" from S. lactis C10 possessed the genetic loci for arsenate and arsenite resistance but not for chromate resistance or copper sensitivity.
TI  - The effect of monovalent and divalent cations on the activity of Streptococcus lactis C10 pyruvate kinase.
AB  - The pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from Streptococcus lactis C10 had an obligatory requirement for both a monovalent cation and divalent cation. NH+4 and K+ activated the enzyme in a sigmoidal manner (nH =1.55) at similar concentrations, whereas Na+ and Li+ could only weakly activate the enzyme. Of eight divalent cations studied, only three (Co2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+) activated the enzyme. The remaining five divalent cations (Cu2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Ni2+ and Ba2+) inhibited the Mg2+ activated enzyme to varying degrees. (Cu2+ completely inhibited activity at 0.1 mM while Ba2+, the least potent inhibitor, caused 50% inhibition at 3.2 mM). In the presence of 1 mM fructose 1,6-diphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) the enzyme showed a different kinetic response to each of the three activating divalent cations. For Co2+, Mn2+ and Mg2+ the Hill interaction coefficients (nH) were 1.6, 1.7 and 2.3 respectively and the respective divalent cation concentrations required for 50% maximum activity were 0.9, 0.46 and 0.9 mM. Only with Mn2+ as the divalent cation was there significatn activity in the absence of Fru-1,6-P2. When Mn2+ replaced Mg2+, the Fru-1,6-P2 activation changed from sigmoidal (nH = 2.0) to hyperbolic (nH = 1.0) kinetics and the Fru-1,6-P2 concentration required for 50% maximum activity decreased from 0.35 to 0.015 mM. The cooperativity of phosphoenolpyruvate binding increased (nH 1.2 to 1.8) and the value of the phosphoenolpyruvate concentration giving half maximal velocity decreased (0.18 to 0.015 mM phosphoenolyruvate) when Mg2+ was replaced by Mn2+ in the presence of 1 mM Fru-1,6-P2. The kinetic response to ADP was not altered significantly when Mn2+ was substituted for Mg2+. The effects of pH on the binding of phosphoenolpyruvate and Fru-1,6-P2 were different depending on whether Mg2+ or Mn2+ was the divalent cation.
TI  - Incidence and properties of temperate bacteriophages induced from lactic streptococci.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of lactic streptococci isolated from commercial lactic streptococcal starter cultures were examined for lysogeny by treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin C. After treatment with the inducing agent, all strains, whether or not they lysed, were examined for evidence of phage release by electron microscopy. Thirty-eight strains yielded intact phages or phage particles of varying morphology. All the temperate phages had isometric heads and noncontractile tails; some had collars and structurally distinctive baseplates. Indicator host strains were found for phages induced from seven different strains. Three strains that released phages spontaneously yielded titers of 10(3) to 10(4) plaque-forming units per ml. When strains that spontaneously released phages were grown in mixed culture with indicator strains, increased phage titers of 10(6) to 10(7) plaque-forming units per ml were observed. These findings indicate that lysogenic lactic streptococcal strains may serve as a reservoir for phages that attack sensitive strains in mixed- or multiple-strain lactic starter cultures.
TI  - Growth requirements and the effect of organic components of the synthetic medium  on the biosynthesis of the antibiotic nisin in Streptococcus lactis strain.
AB  - A synthetic medium SM-3 has been elaborated for growth of Streptococcus lactis strain 51, which contains the minimal number of organic components required for the growth of this strain and nisin production. This medium contains 9 amino acids, 4 vitamins from B group, glucose and mineral salts. Addition of biotin to the medium stimulated the growth of the strain, while the addition of purines and/or pyrimidines had no effect. Hitherto biotin has been considered to be necessary for the growth of S. lactis and purines and pyrimidines were believed to stimulate the growth of these bacteria. In strain 51 the minimal requirements for growth were also the minimal requirements for nisin biosynthesis. Strain 51 produced 3-4 times less nisin in medium SM-3 than in a complex medium. The addition of one of four amino acids (serine, proline, cysteine or cystine) to SM-3 medium increased the amount of antibiotic produced. The addition of all four amino acids simultaneously, caused formation of nisin amounts similar to those produced in complex medium.
TI  - Selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of Streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Hot saline extracts of Streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. Chromatography of the extract of S. mutans strain MT703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 column gave two principal antigens. One antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. The other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. It was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (PGP) from group A Streptococcus pyogenes and/or S. mutans strain Ingbritt (type c). The PGP antigen was further purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-75. Two peaks, PGP-1, and PGP-2, were obtained. Each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-PGP serum as shown by immunodiffusion. Chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. PGP antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. However, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of PGP. The PGP in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity. The addition of diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting PGP antigen. After adsorption of the extract from S. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and PGP antigens were absorbed with the resin. This simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the PGP-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.
TI  - Characteristics and energy requirements of an alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport system in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Galactose-grown cells of Streptococcus lactis ML3 acculated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by using energy derived from glycolysis and arginine catabolism. The transport system displayed low-affinity Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics. Using galactose or arginine as energy sources, similar V max and K m values for AIB entry were obtained, but on prolonged incubation the intracellular steady-state concentration of AIB in cells metabolizing arginine was only 65 to 70% that attained by glycolyzing cells. Efflux of AIB FROM PRELOADED CElls was temperature dependent and exhibited the characteristics of a first-order reaction. The rate of AIB exit was accelerated two- to threefold in the presence of metabolizable energy sources. Metabolic inhibitors including p-chloromercuribenzoate, dinitrophenol, azide, arsentate, and N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide either prevented or greatly reduced AIB uptake. Fluoride, iodoacetate and N-ethylmaleimide abolished galactose-dependent, but not arginine-energized, AIB uptake. K+ and Rb+ reduced the steady-state intracellular AIB concentration by approximately 40%, and these cations also induced rapid efflux of solute from actively transporting cells. Equivalent concentrations (10 mM) of Na+, Li+, or NH4+ were much less inhibitory. The proton-conducting ionophores tetrachlorosalicylanilide and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenlyhydrazone abolished uptake and induced AIB efflux even though glycolysis and arginine catabolism continued at 60 and 140%, respectively, of control rates. A proton motive force is most likely involved in the active transport of AIB, whereas data from efflux studies suggest that energy is coupled to AIB exit in cells of S. lactis ML3.
TI  - Transductional evidence for plasmid linkage of lactose metabolism in streptococcus lactis C2.
AB  - A lactose-negative (Lac-), proteinase-negative (Prt-) mutant, designated C145 was isolated from Streptococcus lactis C2 after treatment with nitrosoguanidine and ultraviolet irradiation. The mutant appeared to be cured of the prophage(s) present in S. lactis C2 based on non-inducibility by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C. When cleared lysate material from C145 was subjected, to cesium chloride-ethidum bromide (EB) density gradient centrifugation, no plasmid peak was observed, suggesting that C145 was cured of plasmid deoxyribonucleic and (DNA). A histogram showing distribution of contour lengths of circular molecules of DNA from C145, however, revealed the presence of a greatly diminished number of DNA molecules as compared with the parent culture and indicated the absence of the 30 x 10(6) plasmid. Cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradient profiles from Lac+, Prt- and Lac+ Prt+ transductants of C145 revealed no plasmid peak, but electron microscopy of the fractions normally possessing the satellite band of DNA showed the presence of a new plasmid species having a molecular weight from 20 x 10(6) to 22 x 10(6). This plasmid was lost when the transductants became Lac-. Examination of a plasmid histogram from a spontaneous Lac- Prt- mutants of S. lactis C2 resembled that of C145, with the absence of the 30 x 10(6) plasmid and the presence of the 22 x 10(6) plasmid in Lac+ Prt+ transductants. The results suggest that lactose metabolism is mediated through the 30 x 10(6) plasmid in S. lactis C2 and that the transducing bacteriophage, which is too small to accommodate the entire plasmid, is transferring about two-thirds of the original plasmid through a process termed transductional shortening.
TI  - Plasmids in Streptococcus lactis: evidence that lactose metabolism and proteinase activity are plasmid linked.
AB  - Populations of lactose positive (Lac+) and proteinase positive (Prt+) cells from  Streptococcus lactis M18, C10, and ML3 grown at 39 degrees C gave rise to increasing proportions of Lac- Prt- clones. The deficiencies did not appear until after a number of generations at the elevated temperature, and the rate depended on the strain.Lac- Prt+ and Lac+ Prt- mutants were isolated after treatment with ethidium bromide. Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid was isolated by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient centrifugation from the parent cultures as well as from their Lac- Prt-, Lac- Prt+, and Lac+ Prt- mutants. Five distinct plasmid sizes of approximate molecular weights of 2,4, 8, 21, and 27 million were found in S. lactis C10, whereas the Lac- Prt- derivative lacked the 8- and 21-million-dalton plasmids, but the 8-million-dalton plasmid was present in the Lac-Att mutant. In S. lactis m18 five plasmids possessing molecular weights of about 2, 4, 10, 18 and 27 million were observed. The 10- and 18-million-dalton plasmids were not detected in the Lac- Prt- mutants, whereas the Lac- Prt+ derivative lacked only the 18-million-dalton plasmid and the Lac+ Prt- mutant lacked only the 10-million-dalton plasmid. In S. lactis ML3 five distinct plasmids, with approximate molecular weights of 2, 4, 8, 22, and 30 million, were present. The 8- and 22-million-dalton plasmids were not detected in the Lac- Prt- derivative, but the 8-million-dalton plasmid was present in the Lac- Prt+ mutant. The evidence suggests that lactose-fermenting ability and proteinase activity in these organisms are mediated through two distinct plasmids having molecular weights of 8 x 10(6) to 10 x 10(6) for proteinase activity and 18 x 10(6) to 22 x 10(6) for lactose metabolism.
TI  - [Desugarization of egg white by microorganisms].
AB  - Glucose was eliminated from egg whites, using microorganisms, to prevent melanoidin formation which may damage the product. Desugarization was achieved by means of Acetobacter xylinum, Streptococcus lactis, Propionibacterium shermanii, Pr. petersonii and propionicacid cocci. Optimal conditions of desugarization were found, depending on the physiological characteristics of the above microorganisms. Propionibacterium shermanii may be well used to ferment a liquid egg white. These bacteria have no proteolytic properties and make no use of the egg white. They enrich the egg white with vitamin B12 and propionate, a preserving agent, during fermentation.
TI  - Purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - The pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) of Streptococcus lactis C10 is activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), activity being a sigmoidal function of activator concentration. The FDP0.5V (Fru-1,6-P2 concentration giving half-maximal velocity) is markedly increased in the presence of low concentrations of inorganic phosphate; 1 mM phosphate increases the FDP0.5V value 6-fold. Although the intracellular level of Fru-1,6-P2 (12-18 mM) in exponentially growing cells on the medium used is much greater than the FDP0.5V for pyruvate kinase (0.2 mM) as determined in triethanolamine-HCl buffer, a much higher Fru-1,6-P2 concentration may be required to activate the enzyme in vivo to overcome phosphate inhibition. Tris and maleate also inhibit the enzyme. At low concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 (0.1 mM), reaction rate is a sigmoidal function of both phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentrations; at near saturating concentrations of activator (1 mM) the response to varying ADP is hyperbolic while the response to varying phosphoenolpyruvate becomes much less sigmoidal. The affinity for both substrates (especially phosphoenolpyruvate) is also increased by increasing the concentration of Fru-1,6-P2. The affinity of the enzyme for guanosine disphosphate (GDP) is 12-13 times that for ADP under the assay conditions used. The Streptococcus lactis pyruvate kinase has a molecular weight of 240000 with a subunit molecular weight of 60000.
TI  - [Effect of the initial pH value of the medium on the growth of Streptococcus lactis and the biosynthesis of nisin].
AB  - The effect of the initial pH value of the medium within 4.0 to 6.6 on the growth  of Str. lactis and biosynthesis of nicin was studied. It was found that at the initial pH 4.0--4.5 of the medium the growth of the culture was poor, i.e. 11--14% of the control (initiral pH 6.6). With an increase in the value of the initial pH at least to 5.0 the growth of Str. lactis also increased. At the initial pH 4.0 no biosynthesis of nicin was observed. Under the experimental conditions the antibiotic synthesis by tr. lactic started at the initial pH being equal to 4.5 and reached its maximum at pH 6.6.
TI  - [Inspection of the bovine udder (author's transl)].
AB  - Cell counts were made once and the presence or absence of Str. agalactiae, Str. uberis, Str. dysgalactiae and St. aureus were determined once in all quarter samples on seventeen normal dairy farms. Of 1,416 quarters studied, 347 (24.5%) showed a cell count of greater than 500,000/ml. and, of 354 udders examined, 202 (57.1%) showed a cell count of greater than 500,000/ml. The total number of quarters infected with pathogenic agents was 287 (20.3%), the number of infected udders being 159 (48.3%). The findings reported by the present author should also be taken into account in the recent discussion of the question whether the udders of lactating cattle intended for slaughter should be systematically condemned or, at any rate, should only be designed for human consumption after having been passed.
TI  - Electron microscopy of virulent phages for Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Electron microscopic studies were made on eight virulent Streptococcus lactis bacteriophages. These phages were taken as representative of eight host range groups established in a study of 75 phage isolates and 253 hosts (213 S. lactis, 22 S. cremoris, 18 S. diacetilactis). The phages studied were shown to have an isometric hexagonal head and noncontractile tails, usually several times longer than the head diameter. The virus heads were octahedral. The phages investigated represented three morphological types on the basis of head diameter , tail thickness, and tail length. These dimensions were approximately: for type I phages, 63, 172, and 11 nm, respectively; type II, 73, 200, and 20 nm, respectively; and type III, represented here by a single phage, 98, 551, and 12 nm, respectively. The tail surface revealed a different arrangment of the structural subunits which lent a helical appearance to the tails of type I and II phages and a guaffered tube appearance to the tail of type III phage. The number of turns along the tail axis, turn length, axial pitch, and helix angle were: type I, 32, 12 to 13 nm, 7.14 nm, and 11 degrees 43', respectively; type II, 24, 24, to 28 nm, 40.00 nm, and 32 degrees 30', respectively; and type III, 120, 12 nm, and no visible slope towards the axis. The morphology types showed complete correlation with serological groups, but not with groups based on host range pattern.
TI  - Clinical significance of Lancefield groups L-T streptococci isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - The aim of a study of all groups L-T streptococci isolated at the Massachusetts General Hospital during a 10-year period (1964-1974) was to ascertain the clinical significance of the less frequently occurring serological groups of streptococci. No organisms of groups P,R,S, or T were found during this time. The case records of 109 clinical isolates of alpha-reacting streptococci of Lancefield groups L,M,N, and O from blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were reviewed. There were six cases of endocarditis and one case of infected sternotomy uound with septicemia due to these streptococci. The two cases of endocarditis due to group O streptococci represent the first cases described with endocarditis caused by this group of organisms. Virtually all of the isolates of groups L,M,N, and O streptococci were susceptible to penicillin. Seventy-four percent of the isolates were judged not responsible for clinical disease. The importance of avoiding inappropriate therapy makes it necessary to realize that these organisms are potential "contaminants" of cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
TI  - Isolation and examination of transducing bacteriophage particles from Streptococcus lactis C2.
AB  - Two defective transducing bacteriophages induced by exposure of Streptococcus lactis C2 to ultraviolet irradiation have been isolated and characterized. These temperate phages designated c2t1 and c2t2 were isolated by cesium chloride equilibrium density gradient centrifugation of phage preparations concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation. The equilibrium gradient contained two visually apparent phage bands positioned at densities of 1.487 and 1.463 g cm-3 respective for c2t1 and c2t2. Particle morphology and phenol extracted phage deoxyribonucleic acid were examined by electron microscopy for each phage. Head diameter, deoxyribonucleic acid length, and molecular weight for c2t1 were 60 nm, 10.9 mum, and 22.6 x 10(6) daltons, respectively. Phage c2t2 had a head diameter of 70nm, a deoxribonucleic acid length of 11.4 mum, and a molecular weight of 23.8 x 10(6) daltons. Comparing head diameter and phage deoxyribonucleic acid length suggests that the variation in c2t1 and c2t2 density was due to difference in head size. Phage c2t2 exhibited high frequency transduction of lactose metabolism based on preparations equilibrated by adjustment of optical density at 260 nm. Maltose and proteinase markers also were transduced by both phages. The transducing phage was defective, requiring a helper for the formation of transducing particles but not for the transduction process. Superinfection immunity was not conferred on post-infecting phage. The results demonstrated transduction by two nonidentical phage particles lysogenic for S. lactis C2.
TI  - Activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from lactic streptococci.
AB  - The pyruvate kinase from lactic streptococci was activated by 20 structurally dissimilar sugar phosphates and glycolytic intermediates. Nine compounds were more effective activators than fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
TI  - [Effect of iodoacetic acid and sodium fluoride on the development of lactic acid  bacterium Streptococcus lactis, a producer of the polypeptide antibiotic nisin].
AB  
TI  - [The effect of purine and pyrimidine bases on the growth of Streptococcus lactis  and the biosynthesis of nisin].
AB  - The method of mathematical modelling of the experiment was used to determine optimum concentrations of purine and pyrimidine bases for the growth of Streptococcus lactis and the biosynthesis of nisin. These bases were introduced into the medium at different concnetrations. Thymine at a concentration of 4 mcg/ml stimulated the biosynthesis of nisin, and adenine and hypoxanthine at a concentration of 15 mcg/ml produced a favourable effect on the growth of the culture.
TI  - [Streptococcus lactis bacteriophage in the oral cavity].
AB  
TI  - [Some properties of bacteriophages isolated in brynza manufacture].
AB  - According to the spectrum of lytic action towards 253 strains of Streptococcus lactis, 75 bacteriophages were subdivided into eight groups. According to their antigenic properties and morphology of their particles, the phages can be divided into three groups. Only two types of negative colony were found in the phages. The results of this study may be used to select bacterial strains during production of cheese.
TI  - [Effect of age and the amount of inoculate on the growth of Streptococcus lactis  and its formation of nisin].
AB  - The cells of Streptococcus lactis, strain MGU, synthesize considerable amounts of nisine in the course of their growth. The rate of metabolic processes is not increased by stirring if the medium is complete and easily assimilated. Utilization of a young inoculate (1.5, 3, and 6 hours) reduces the process of nisine production by 1.5--2 times. The amount of the inoculate exceeding 1.5 volume percent has no significant effect on the biosynthesis.
TI  - [Effect of vitamins on the biosynthesis of nisin by a Streptococcus lactis culture].
AB  - Milk is the natural medium for Str. lactis, strain MSU. It is known that in winter and spring the growth and acid production by acidolactic streptococci are decreased. This is due, in particular, to the absence of vitamins in winter and spring milk. A number of vitamins present in complex natural products, such as tomato juice, milk and casein hydrolysates, beaf extract, etc. was studied with respect to their effect on the synthesis of nisin. The organic complexes had a positive effect on the growth of Str. lactis and the antibiotic biosynthesis. However, Str. lactis, strain MSU did not intensify the nisin synthesis on addition of vitamins to the spring skin milk. Possibly, lactis, strain MSU was of low sensitivity to the season of changes in milk.
TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
TI  - Possible plasmid nature of the determinant for production of the antibiotic nisin in some strains of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  
TI  - Plasmid distribution and evidence for a proteinase plasmid in Streptococcus lactis C2-1.
AB  - Five plasmids, distinguishable by their molecular weights (10(6), 2 x 10(6), 5 x  10(6), 10(7), 3 x 10(7), respectively) were isolated from Streptococcus lactis C2. A spontaneous proteinase-negative derivative of this strain lacked the 10(7) plasmid.
TI  - Occurence of lactose-negative mutants in chemostat cultures of lactic streptococci.
AB  - Batch and chemostat cultures of Streptococcus cremoris HP and Streptococcus lactis 829 were examined for lactose-hegative (lac-)mutants on indicator agar. In batch cultures, S. cremoris HP gave less than 1% of the total count as lac- colonies while S. lactis 829 consistently contained about 15% of the total as lac- colonies. In chemostat cultures of S. cremoris HP in 2% skim milk containing casamino acids and yeast extract (0.1% each), the percentage of lac- colonies increased markedly when the temperature of growth was 18 degrees C but not when the temperature of growth was 25 degrees C. The percentage of lac- colonies in chemostat cultures in the skim milk medium at 25 degrees C was about the same as that in batch cultures. On the other hand, when chemostat cultures of S. lactis 829 in the skim milk medium were grown at several temperatures between 18 and 33 degrees C, the percentage of lac- colonies was markedly lower than that found in batch cultures of this organism. Cultivation of S. cremoris HP in chemostats with yeast extract-glucose broth at low temperature (18 degrees C) resulted in a selection of cells giving lac- colonies and atypical (small) lac+ colonies. The results show that cultivation of S. cremoris HP and S. lactis 829 in chemostats sometimes gave rise to altered populations. Conditions causing a change in one organism did not necessarily cause a similar change in the other. The results indicate that the successful propagation of lactic streptococci in chemostats for use as starter cultures in the dairy industry will require the careful establishment of optimum conditions for every strain so as to minimize the possible selection of undesirable populations.
TI  - The nature of the stimulation of the growth of Streptococcus lactis by yeast extract.
AB  - Yeast extract was fractionated on Sephadex G-25 into 7 fractions. The fraction most stimulatory to the growth of Streptococcus lactis C10 contained over 70% of the amino N present in yeast extract and consisted of a wide variety of free amino acids and a small amount of peptide material. Examination of possible replacement factors for this fraction revealed that the amino -acid material present was largely responsible for the stimulation of Str. lactis C10. Purine and pyrimidine bases and inorganic constituents also contributed to the stimulation. In addition, yeast extract contained a component which decomposed H2O2, a metabolite which accumulates in the growth medium under aerobic conditions and inhibits growth. The nature of the stimulation was studied by isolating slow and fast acid-producing colonies of Str. lactis C10. It appeared that yeast extract and other amino-acid supplements prevented an observed inhibition of the growth of the slow variants below pH 6.0, apparently by satisfying a nutritional deficiency caused by a drop in pH.
TI  - Lipid composition of a nisin-producing strain of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  
TI  - ATP synthesis driven by a protonmotive force in Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - An electrochemical potential difference for hydrogen ions ( a protonmotive force) was artifically imposed across the membrane of the anaerobic bacterium Streptococcus lactis. When cells were exposed to the ionophore, valinomycin, the electrical gradient was established by a potassium diffusion potential. A chemical gradient of protons was established by manipulating the transmembrane pH gradient. When the protonmotive force attained a value of 215 mV or greater, net ATP synthesis was catalyzed by the membrane-bound Ca++, Mg++ -stimulated ATPase. This was true whether the protonmotive force was dominated by the membrane potential (negative inside) or the pH gradient (alkaline inside). Under these conditions, ATP synthesis could be blocked by the ATPase inhibitor, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or by ionophores which rendered the membrane specifically permeable to protons. These observations provide strong evidence in support of the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which states that the membrane-bound ATPase couples the inward movement of protons to the synthesis of ATP.
TI  - Characterization of lac+ transductants of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - A phage-mediated transducing system was used in studying certain physiological characteristics of S. lactis C2 wild type, lactose-negative mutants, and lactose-positive transductants. Lac(-) mutants, obtained by acriflavine treatment of the wild type, were similar to the wild type in all characteristics tested except they lacked beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase (beta-Pgal) and could not transport [(14)C]lactose; they also had approximately 10% of the proteolytic ability than wild-type cells. The lactose-fermenting characteristic was transduced from the wild type to Lac(-) mutants. The Lac(+) transductants obtained were similar to the wild-type parent with respect to lactose fermentation and level of beta-Pgal activity (0.186 U of protein per mg). These transductants, however, had not regained full proteolytic ability and were similar to the Lac(-) mutant in this respect. Lactic acid production of the transductants in milk was approximately two-thirds that of the wild type. Data suggest that both the lactose-fermenting and proteolytic characters are carried on extrachromasomal particles (plasmids).
TI  - A protonmotive force drives ATP synthesis in bacteria.
AB  - When cells of Streptococcus lactis or Escherichia coli were suspended in a potassium-free medium, a membrane potential (negative inside) could be artificially generated by the addition of the potassium ionophore, valinomycin. In response to this inward directed protonmotive force, ATP synthesis catalyzed by the membrane-bound ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) was observed. The formation of ATP was not found in S. lactis that had been treated with the ATPase inhibitor, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, nor was it observed in a mutant of E. coli lacking the ATPase. Inhibition of ATP synthesis in S. lactis was also observed when the membrane potential was reduced by the presence of external potassium, or when cells were first incubated with the proton conductor, carbonylcyanidefluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. These results are in agreement with predictions made by the chemiosmotic hypothesis of Mitchell.
TI  - Pyruvate kinase of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - The kinetic properties of pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from Streptococcus lactis have been investigated. Positive homotropic kinetics were observed with phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate, resulting in a sigmoid relationship between reaction velocity and substrate concentrations. This relationship was abolished with an excess of the heterotropic effector fructose-1,6-diphosphate, giving a typical Michaelis-Menten relationship. Increasing the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate increased the apparent V(max) values and decreased the K(m) values for both substrates. Catalysis by pyruvate kinase proceeded optimally at pH 6.9 to 7.5 and was markedly inhibited by inorganic phosphate and sulfate ions. Under certain conditions adenosine 5'-triphosphate also caused inhibition. The K(m) values for phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate in the presence of 2 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate were 0.17 mM and 1 mM, respectively. The concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate giving one-half maximal velocity with 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate and 5 mM adenosine 5'-diphosphate was 0.07 mM. The intracellular concentrations of these metabolites (0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.4 mM adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and 18 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate) suggest that the pyruvate kinase in S. lactis approaches maximal activity in exponentially growing cells. The role of pyruvate kinase in the regulation of the glycolytic pathway in lactic streptococci is discussed.
TI  - Characterization of lactose-fermenting revertants from lactose-negative Streptococcus lactis C2 mutants.
AB  - Partial lactose-fermenting revertants from lactose-negative (lac(-)) mutants of Streptococcus lactis C2 appeared on a lawn of lac(-) cells after 3 to 5 days of incubation at 25 C. The revertants grew slowly on lactose with a growth response similar to that for cryptic cells. In contrast to lac(+)S. lactis C2, the revertants were defective in the accumulation of [(14)C]thiomethyl-beta-d-galactoside, indicating that they were devoid of a transport system. Hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside-6-phosphate by toluene-treated cells confirmed the presence of phospho-beta-d-galactosidase (P-beta-gal) in the revertant. However, this enzyme was induced only when the cells were grown in the presence of lactose; galactose was not an inducer. In lac(+)S. lactis C2, enzyme induction occurred in lactose- or galactose-grown cells. The revertants were defective in EII-lactose and FIII-lactose of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Galactokinase activity was detected in cell extracts of lac(+)S. lactis C2, but the activity was 9 to 13 times higher in extracts from the revertant and lac(-), respectively. This suggested that the lac(-) and the revertants use the Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism and that galactose-1-phosphate rather than galactose-6-phosphate was being formed. This may explain why lactose, but not galactose, induced P-beta-gal in the revertants. Because the revertant was unable to form galactose-6-phosphate, induction could not occur. This compound would be formed on hydrolysis of lactose phosphate. The data also indicate that galactose-6-phosphate may serve not only as an inducer of the lactose genes in S. lactis C2, but also as a repressor of the Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism.
TI  - Simultaneous loss of proteinase- and lactose-utilizing enzyme activities in Streptococcus lactis and reversal of loss by transduction.
AB  - During studies on spontaneous loss of lactose metabolism in Streptococcus lactis  C2, it was found that the lactose-negative (lac(-)) mutants were also proteinase negative (prt(-)). This pleiotropic effect was observed in S. diacetilactis 18-16, but not in S. cremoris B1. The lac(-)prt(-) mutants from S. lactis C2 were able to grow in milk, but no pH change or measurable protein breakdown occurred. When the milk was supplemented with glucose, a slow decline in pH occurred. Addition of a protein hydrolysate to milk did not stimulate acid production. When both supplements were added to milk, normal growth and pH change were obtained. When the lac(-)prt(-) mutant of S. lactis C2 was transduced with the temperate phage from the lac(+)prt(+) parent culture, approximately equal numbers of lac(+)prt(-) and lac(+)prt(+) transductants were obtained. When the spontaneous lac(+)prt(-) strain of S. lactis C2 was converted to a lac(-)prt(-) derivative and transduced, similar results were obtained. The co-transduction of the lactose and proteinase markers suggest they are closely associated. The findings indicate that the transducing phage from S. lactis C2 can be used to examine the causes of instability in both the lactose and proteinase enzyme systems of this organism.

TI  - Proteinase activity in slow lactic acid-producing variants of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Variants of Streptococcus lactis that produce lactic acid slowly in milk were isolated by inducing plasmid loss in the wild type at 39 to 40 C. Such strains had lost most of their surface-bound proteinase activity and were designated prt(-). The specific proteinase activities of S. lactis C10 prt(+) whole cells and solubilized cell walls were 7 and 18 times, respectively, those of the prt(-) strain, but spheroplast lysates of prt(+) and prt(-) strains contained similar proteinase activity. S. lactis H1 showed a similar relative distribution of activity between prt(+) and prt(-) cellular fractions, although the overall level was lower. The limited growth in milk, characteristic of prt(-) strains, can be explained in terms of their low surface-bound proteinase activity.
TI  - Localization of proteinase(s) near the cell surface of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Two criteria suggest that most of the proteinase of Streptococcus lactis is localized in the cell wall. (i) Intact cells possess proteinase activity when incubated with a high-molecular-weight substrate. (ii) Most of the cell-bound proteinase activity is released during spheroplast formation under conditions which result in the release of only 1% of the intracellular enzymes aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The solubilized cell wall, plasma membrane, and cytoplasm fractions contained 84, 0, and 16%, respectively, of the total proteinase activity with casein as substrate. The physiological role of a surface-bound proteinase in this organism is discussed.

TI  - Extrachromosomal elements in group N streptococci.
AB  - The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Streptococcus lactis C2, S. cremoris B(1), and S. diacetilactis 18-16 was labeled by growing cells in Trypticase soy broth containing (3)H-labeled thymine. The cells were gently lysed with lysozyme, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and sodium lauryl sulfate. The chromosomal DNA was separated from plasmid DNA by precipitation with 1.0 M sodium chloride. The existence of covalently closed circular DNA in the three organisms was shown by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient centrifugation of the cleared lysate material. In an attempt to correlate the loss of lactose metabolism with the loss of plasmid DNA, lactose-negative mutants of these organisms were examined for the presence of extrachromosomal particles. Covalently closed circular DNA was detected in the lactose-negative mutants of S. lactis C2 and S. diacetilactis 18-16. In S. cremoris B(1), however, no covalently closed circular DNA was observed by using cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradients. Electron micrographs of the satellite band material from S. lactis C2 and its lactose-negative mutant confirmed the presence of plasmid DNA. Three distinct plasmids having approximate molecular weights of 1.3 x 10(6), 2.1 x 10(6), and 5.1 x 10(6) were observed in both organisms.

TI  - Morphology of the bacteriophages of lactic streptococci.
AB  - Electron microscope studies have been made of a number of phages of lactic streptococci, seven of which were phages of Streptococcus lactis C10. Two of the phages are thought to be identical; five have been classified by the method of Tikhonenko as belonging to group IV (phages with noncontractile tails) with type III tail plates; one belongs to group V (phages with tails possessing a contractile sheath). Both prolate polyhedral heads and isometric polyhedral heads are represented among the group IV phages. The phage drc3 of S. diacetilactis DRC3 has been shown to have similar structure to the group IV phages of S. lactis C10 with prolate polyhedral heads. The phages ml1, hp, c11, and z8 of the S. cremoris strains ML1, HP, C11, and Z8, respectively, were shown to belong to the group IV phages with type III tail plates by the method of Tikhonenko. All had octahedral heads and tended to be larger than most of the other phages studied.

TI  - Lysogenic strains of group N lactic streptococci.
AB  - A temperate bacteriophage, designated r(1)t, was inducible from the group N lactic streptococcus, Streptococcus cremoris R(1), by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. Induced lysates produced plaques on lawns of three closely related S. cremoris strains, AM(1), SK(11), and US(3). Strain SK(11) was readily lysogenized. S. cremoris AM(1) was the most reliable indicator strain, although the age of the culture used for seeding plates was critical. Zones of lysis but no plaque formation were observed on lawns of nine additional S. cremoris strains. Phage r(1)t could not be detected in filtrates of stationary-phase R(1) cultures and was near the limits of detection in logarithmically growing cultures. Phage levels were still very low (1 plaque-forming unit on AM(1) per 10 induced cells) in induced lysates of R(1) cultures. These low levels of detectable phage may be attributable to an inadequate indicator, lysogenization of the indicator, adsorption of induced phage to cellular debris, concurrent induction of other undetectable phages, or the production of high proportions of defective phages. Electron micrographs of induced R(1) lysates revealed a high incidence of incomplete phage particles, fragments, and ghosts.

TI  - Carbohydrate metabolism in lactic streptococci: fate of galactose supplied in free or disaccharide form.
AB  - Phosphorylation of free galactose by lactic streptococci was mediated by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent kinase. The phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphotransferase system (PTS) was involved to a limited extent in transport of the sugar. The conversion of free galactose to glucose also was demonstrated, and uridine diphosphogalactose-4-epimerase was demonstrated to account for this change. Galactose, supplied as lactose, was phosphorylated during transport by means of the PTS with PEP as the phosphate donor. Data also indicated that galactose derived from lactose was catabolized by the glycolytic pathway. Results showed the participation of ATP or PEP, or both, in the phosphorylation of five growth sugars for lactic streptococci, namely, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, and mannose. Free galactose was phosphorylated exclusively by ATP except when cells were grown on galactose; in this case, slight involvement of PEP in phosphorylation also was noted. Lactose phosphorylation was much more effective with PEP except when cells were grown on lactose, in which case ATP was equally effective. Glucose was phosphorylated to about the same degree by either ATP or PEP.

TI  - Proton-coupled accumulation of galactoside in Streptococcus lactis 7962.
AB  - When cells of the anaerobe Streptococcus lactis 7962 are deprived of their normal fermentable energy source, active transport of galactosides is completely abolished although the membrane carriers are still capable of facilitating the equilibration of sugars across the cell membrane. In these nonmetabolizing cells it was possible to test the Mitchell hypothesis of obligatory coupling of proton movement with sugar transport. This hypothesis was supported by alkalinization of the medium observed when thiomethylgalactoside was added to a lightly buffered suspension of S. lactis cells. Conversely, addition of protons resulted in active transport of thiomethylgalactoside. Accumulation of thiomethylgalactoside to a concentration more than 20-times that in the external medium was induced by suddenly exposing cells to a medium at pH 6; no accumulation of thiomethylgalactoside was observed with cells exposed to pH 8.Active transport of thiomethylgalactoside occurred in the absence of energy metabolism when S. lactis cells were treated with valinomycin. This ionophore allowed intracellular K(+) to flow out, thus imposing a membrane potential (inside negative). This potential resulted in a proton uptake and an associated active transport of galactoside. The membrane potential was measured from the distribution ratio (inside/outside) of K(+) in the presence of valinomycin. The pH gradient was measured from the distribution ratio of [(14)C]methylamine. The protonmotive force, calculated from the membrane potential and the pH gradient, was found to be directly related to the accumulation of galactoside, in accordance with the chemiosmotic hypothesis.
TI  - Transduction of lactose metabolism in Streptococcus lactis C2.
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV)-induced phage lysates, from lactose-positive (lac(+)) Streptococcus lactis C2, transduced lactose fermenting ability to lac(-) recipient cells of this organism. Although the phage titer could not be determined due to the absence of an appropriate indicator strain, the number of transductants was proportional to the amount of phage lysate added. Treatment of the lysate with deoxyribonuclease had no effect on this conversion, indicating the observed genetic change was not mediated by free deoxyribonucleic acid. When the lac(+) transductants were isolated and exposed to UV irradiation, lysates with higher transducing ability were obtained. The transducing ability of this lysate was about 100-fold higher than that observed in the original lysates. The lac(+) transductants were unstable since lac(-) segregants occurred at high frequency. The phage lysate from S. lactis C2 also transduced maltose and mannose metabolism to the respective negative recipient cells. The results demonstrate the transduction of carbohydrate markers by a streptococcal phage and establish a genetic transfer system in group N streptococci.
TI  - Stimulation of lactic acid bacteria by a micrococcus isolate: evidence for multiple effects.
AB  - Growth of, and rate of acid production by, six cultures of lactic acid bacteria were increased in the presence of Micrococcus isolate F4 or a preparation of its capsular material. Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide found in pure cultures of the lactic acid bacteria were not detectable, or were greatly reduced, in mixed culture with Micrococcus isolate F4. The capsular material was not as effective as whole cells in preventing accumulation of H(2)O(2). Catalase stimulated growth of, and the rate of acid production by, the lactic acid bacteria, but not to the same extent as Micrococcus isolate F4 in some cultures. The existence of two mechanisms for micrococcal stimulation of the lactic acid bacteria is postulated. One mechanism involves removal of H(2)O(2); the other has not been characterized.

AB  - Streptococcus lactis C2 has been used extensively by many laboratories in studies on the metabolism of lactic streptococci. By using ultraviolet irradiation as the inducing agent, this organism was shown to release a small bacteriophage, indicating that it is a lysogenic strain. The induced phage had a head approximately 40 nm in diameter and a tail length and width of about 180 and 6 nm, respectively. A structure resembling a collar was observed. Attempts to isolate a sensitive indicator strain for the virus were unsuccessful.
TI  - Effect of selected lactic acid bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus and production of enterotoxin.
AB  - Representative strains of 15 species of lactic acid bacteria were examined for their ability to influence growth of Staphylococcus aureus and production of enterotoxin in associative culture. Among the organisms used as effectors the streptococci were most inhibitory, followed by Pediococcus cerevisiae. The lactobacilli and Leuconostoc citrovorum were not inhibitory to growth and only slightly inhibitory to production of enterotoxin. Enterotoxin was detected in all cultures in which the population of S. aureus reached 8 x 10(7) per ml. At lower S. aureus populations no enterotoxin was detected after incubation for 48 h. Mechanisms of inhibition of growth and enterotoxin production by S. aureus strain 243 grown in association with Streptococcus lactis A64 or P. cerevisiae 10791 in APT broth were investigated. Competition for vital nutrients, especially niacin and biotin, and probably production of hydrogen peroxide contribute to inhibition. Production of lactic acid appears to inhibit growth of S. aureus in the early but not the late stages of incubation.
TI  - Fractionation of dipeptidase activities of Streptococcus lactis and dipeptidase specificity of some lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Proteins in sonic extracts of Streptococcus lactis were separated by starch-gel electrophoresis at high voltage. Each slab was sliced longitudinally, and half was stained for peptidases in a mixture containing a peptide, L-amino acid oxidase (snake venom), peroxidase, and o-dianisdine; the other half was stained in amido black for protein. In addition to sonic treatment, trypsin also released enzyme from acetone-treated cells. Glycyl-L-phenylalanine, L-phenylalanyl-glycine, L-alanyl-L-phenylalanine, and L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine served as substrates in characterizing the enzymes. Five different fractions of various specificities appeared in the gels. Broad-range substrate specificities were found for sonic extracts of S. lactis, S. cremoris, S. durans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - -D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase of lactic streptococci.
AB  - beta-D-Phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase (beta-Pgal) was examined in a number of lactic streptococci by use of the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside-6-phosphate. Specific activity of beta-Pgal ranged from 0.563 units/mg of protein in Streptococcus lactis UN, to 0.120 in S. diacetilactics 18-16. Essentially no beta-D-galactoside galactohydrolase (beta-gal) was found in these organisms when o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside served as the chromogenic substrate. S. lactis 7962 was the one exception found. This organism contained rather high levels of beta-gal, and very little beta-Pgal could be detected. beta-Pgal activity was examined in streptococci that differed widely in both their proteolytic ability and rates of lactic acid production during growth in milk. Differences in proteolytic ability did not influence beta-Pgal synthesis; also, the rate of lactic acid production was independent of the level of beta-Pgal present in the cell, since the rate of lactic acid production could be increased approximately fourfold without changing the amount of beta-Pgal present in the cell. Various carbohydrates were tested as potential inducers of the enzyme. Although galactose, either as the free sugar or combined with glucose in lactose, was the only inducer, noninducing sugars such as mannose or glucose showed some ability to cause fluctuations in the basal level of beta-Pgal. Cells growing in mannose or glucose exhibited about 30% of the maximal enzyme levels found in cells growing in lactose or galactose. No gratuitous inducers were found.
TI  - Lysogeny in lactic streptococci producing and not producing nisin.
AB  - Eighty-seven strains of lactic streptococci (46 of Streptococcus lactis, 24 of S. diacetilactis, and 17 of S. cremoris) were tested for lysogeny; 12 S. lactis strains produced nisin. Lysogeny was found in five S. lactis strains (two of them were nisin producers) and in two S. diacetilactis strains. Four S. lactis and two S. diacetilactis lysogens liberated phages both spontaneously and after ultraviolet treatment, and one S. lactis strain liberated phages spontaneously only. No lysogens were found among the S. cremoris strains tested. An initial characterization of the lysogens and their phages was made. The lytic spectrum of some of the examined phages was very narrow (homospecific), whereas that of others was wide, including strains of the three investigated species.
TI  - Effect of variations in conditions of incubation upon inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by Pediococcus cerevisiae and Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - The effects of pH, temperature, proportion of Staphylococcus aureus in the inoculum, various strains of effector organism, and various strains of S. aureus were examined for their influence on interactions between staphylococci and effector organisms in associative culture. In general, small changes in pH had little effect upon either growth of S. aureus or production of enterotoxin in associative culture. Inhibition of growth of S. aureus caused by effector organisms was much greater at 25 than at 30 C. Proportion of S. aureus in the inoculum greatly affected both growth of the staphylococci and production of enterotoxin. Only slight differences were found between strains of either effector organism or S. aureus which affected the interactions in associative culture.

TI  - Heterofermentative carbohydrate metabolism of lactose-impaired mutants of Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - Two mutants of Streptococcus lactis ATCC 11454 have been isolated which possess an impaired lactose-fermenting capacity; galactose utilization is also affected, but to a lesser extent. Although the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway is the major, if not the sole, pathway of carbohydrate metabolism in the three strains, the fermentation end products of the mutants are dramatically different from the typical homolactic pattern of the wild type. Under conditions of low oxygen tension and growth-limiting lactose concentrations, mutant strain T-1 produces largely formic acid, acetic acid (2:1), and ethanol rather than lactic acid. Aerated cultures produce acetic acid, CO(2) (1:1), acetyl-methylcarbinol, and diacetyl. When the mutants use galactose as an energy source, lactic acid is the major end product, but significant heterofermentative activity is observed. The aberrations responsible for the mutant phenotypes reside in the proteins which catalyze the transport and hydrolysis of galactosides. It is hypothesized that the impaired transport system of the mutants reduces the intracellular pool of glycolytic intermediates below that of the wild type. Since fructose-1, 6-diphosphate is an activator of lactic dehydrogenase in S. lactis, lactic acid production is reduced, and pathways leading to the formation of other products are expressed.

The two enzymes were isolated and purified and were found to differ with respect to pH optima, activation by fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pH and heat stability, and the temperature at which each enzyme was formed in the organism during growth. The presence of a racemase for lactic acid was not detected by the methods used.

TI  - Loss of lactose metabolism in lactic streptococci.
AB  - Lactose-negative mutants occurred spontaneously in broth cultures of Streptococcus lactis C(2)F. Instability of lactose metabolism was noted in other strains of S. lactis, in strains of S. cremoris, and in S. diacetilactis. Colonies of S. lactis C(2)F grown with lactose as the carbohydrate source also possessed lac(-) cells. Treatment of lactic streptococci with the mutagen acriflavine (AF) increased the number of non-lactose-fermenting variants. The effect of AF on growth and on loss of lactose-fermenting ability in S. lactis C(2)F was consequently further examined. The presence of AF appears to favor competitively the growth of spontaneously occurring lactose-negative cells and appears to act in the conversion of lactose-positive to non-lactose-fermenting cells. The lactose-negative mutants partially revert to lactose-positive variants which remain defective in lactose metabolism and remain unable to coagulate milk. The lactose-negative cells become dominant in continuous culture growth and provide evidence that alterations in the characteristics of starter strains can be produced by continuous culture, in this case, the complete loss in ability to ferment lactose.

AB  - Eight single-strain lactic streptococci, three commercial cheese starters, and six lactic acid bacteria isolated from yoghurt were examined for their susceptibility to penicillin, cloxacillin, tetracycline-hydrochloride and streptomycin. The ranges of the antibiotics causing 50% inhibition of the bacteria were (mug/ml): penicillin, 0.009 to 0.20; cloxacillin, 0.24 to 2.50; tetracycline, 0.09 to 0.60; and streptomycin, 0.35 to 13.0. The average concentrations required to cause 50 and 100% inhibition of the cheese starters were (mug/ml): penicillin, 0.12 and 0.26; cloxacillin, 1.91 and 3.9; tetracycline-hydrochloride, 0.13 and 0.36; and streptomycin, 0.59 and 2.06. All the cocci were about equally susceptible to tetracycline, and all organisms were more resistant to cloxacillin than penicillin. The yoghurt isolates were more resistant to streptomycin and more susceptible to penicillin than the cheese starters. The 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride test, using Streptococcus thermophilus BC as assay organism, does not detect low levels of streptomycin in milk. However, it is useful in detecting cloxacillin residues.

Nisin was added to growing cultures of a nisin-producing strain of Streptococcus lactis (354/07) and enterotoxin B to strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S6 and 243) producing enterotoxin B. One quarter (12 mug/ml) of the amount of nisin formed by the culture of S. lactis inhibited lag-phase cells and lysed log-phase cells. The same amount of nisin added before inoculation or at a time when nisin synthesis had started (in late log phase), caused only transient delay in growth. Inhibition of growth of the two enterotoxin B-producing strains of S. aureus could not be demonstrated at any stage of their growth cycle with as much as 1 mg of enterotoxin B per ml of medium.

AB  - Streptococcus lactis (ATCC 7962) accumulated thiomethyl-beta-galactoside (TMG) and other galactosides against concentration gradients when the cells were supplied with a metabolizable substrate, such as glucose. The accumulated TMG was free and not phosphorylated. In the absence of glucose, TMG rapidly entered the cell to a concentration equal to that of the medium. Agents that uncouple oxidative phosphorylation abolished active transport but not the carrier-facilitated entry of TMG. Evidence that the transport carriers were functional in the absence of glucose or in the presence of uncoupling agents included the demonstration of counterflow, which depends on competitive inhibition for the carrier for exit.
TI  - Stimulation of lactic streptococci in milk by -galactosidase.
AB  - Acid production in milk by lactic streptococci was stimulated by added beta-galactosidase. Both glucose and galactose accumulated rapidly in the presence of this enzyme. Glucose accumulation ceased as the culture entered the most rapid period of acid production, whereas galactose accumulation continued. In cultures without added beta-galactosidase, a low concentration of galactose accumulated in the milk, whereas glucose was not detected after 2 hr of incubation. Cultures grew and produced acid faster in broth containing glucose rather than galactose or lactose. These observations suggest that the lactic streptococci do not metabolize the lactose in milk efficiently enough to permit optimum acid production and that a phenomenon such as catabolite repression functions to allow for a preferential use of glucose over either galactose or lactose. In addition to providing the culture with a more readily available energy source, it is possible that the culture produced more acidic metabolites as a result of preferentially utilizing the glucose released by the action of the beta-galactosidase.
