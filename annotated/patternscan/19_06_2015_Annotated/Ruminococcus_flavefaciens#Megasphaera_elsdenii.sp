TI  == the effects of active dried and killed dried yeast on subacute ruminal acidosis,  ruminal fermentation, and nutrient digestibility in beef heifers.
AB  == the study addressed the importance of yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) viability  for reducing the incidence of subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) and improving total tract nutrient digestibility in beef heifers. six ruminally cannulated beef heifers (680 +/- 50 kg bw) were used in a replicated 3 x 3 latin square design and were fed a diet consisting of 40% barley silage, 10% chopped grass hay, and 50% barley grain-based concentrate (dm basis). treatments were 1) no yeast (control), 2) active dried yeast (ady; 4 g providing 10(10) cfu/g; ab vista, marlborough, uk), and 3) killed dried yeast (kdy; 4 g autoclaved ady). the treatments were directly dosed via the ruminal cannula daily at the time of feeding. the periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation (d 1 to 14) and 7 d of measurements (d 15 to 21). ruminal ph was continuously measured (d 15 to 21) using an indwelling system. ruminal contents were sampled on d 15 and 17 at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after feeding. total tract nutrient digestibility was measured using an external marker (ybcl3) from d 15 to 19. no treatment difference was observed for dmi (p = 0.86). yeast supplementation (ady and kdy) tended to increase total tract digestibility of starch (p = 0.07) whereas no effects were observed on digestibility of other nutrients. both ady and kdy elevated minimum (p < 0.01) and mean ruminal ph (p = 0.02) whereas no effects were observed on maximum ph (p = 0.12). irrespective of its viability, yeast supplementation was effective in reducing time that ruminal ph was below 5.8 (p < 0.01) and 5.6 (p <  0.01). no treatment differences were observed for the ruminal vfa profile and lactate concentration. no treatment differences were observed on the relative population size of streptococcus bovis, fibrobacter succinogenes, and megasphaera elsdenii (p > 0.10); however, the proportion of ruminococcus flavefaciens in solid fraction of digesta was greater with kdy (p = 0.05). the study demonstrates the positive effects of yeast, irrespective of its viability, in reducing the severity of sara. however, further studies are required to evaluate the importance of yeast viability for other dietary conditions, particularly when the risk of acidosis is high.

TI  == effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses  of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with  increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.

TI  == effect of ruminal pulse dose of polyunsaturated fatty acids on ruminal microbial  populations and duodenal flow and milk profiles of fatty acids.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the effect of ruminal pulse dose of free linoleic acid (la) and free docosahexaenoic acid (dha) on microbial populations in the rumen, duodenal fatty acid (fa) flow, milk composition, and milk fa profiles of chinese holstein dairy cows. four rumen- and duodenal-fistulated chinese holstein cows in mid lactation (138.5 +/- 10d in milk) were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups and 1 control group in a 4 x 4 latin square design over 4 periods (3 wk per period). diets contained either no la or 2.7% la and either no dha or 0.5% dha in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. ruminal pulse dose with dha increased counts of megasphaera elsdenii, decreased fibrobacter succinogenes, but did not affect butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  or ruminococcus flavefaciens. the pulse dose of la at 2.7% dry matter had no effect on the population sizes of the 3 major cellulolytic bacterial species or m. elsdenii, and no interaction was observed between la and dha. the pulse dose of la or dha, either alone or in combination, increased the duodenal flow of vaccenic acid (va). the milk va and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla) contents also increased in response to the fatty acid pulse dose, and the pulse dose of both la and dha together had the most profound stimulatory effect. this study indicated that ruminal pulse dose of la or dha could be used to increase duodenal flow of va and the milk contents of potentially health-promoting fa, such as va and cis-9,trans-11 cla. these results might be useful in formulating dietary interventions to improve milk cis-9,trans-11 cla contents.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == effects of a saccharomyces cerevisiae culture on ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the effects of a yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) culture on lactate utilization and cellulose digestion by ruminal bacteria. growth of selenomonas ruminantium hd4 in medium that contained 5 g/l of dl-lactate, trypticase, and yeast extract was stimulated 7 and 15% by 1 and 5% (vol/vol) yeast culture filtrate respectively. the 1 and 5% yeast culture filtrate stimulated growth of selenomonas ruminantium h18 and megasphaera elsdenii b159 and t81 on 5 g/l of dl-lactate in medium without trypticase or yeast extract. growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 and ruminococcus albus b199 on 6 g/l of cellobiose was stimulated by the addition of yeast culture filtrate to medium without trypticase or yeast extract. the yeast culture filtrate increased the concentrations of acetate and total volatile fatty acids that were  produced by sel. ruminantium hd4 and increased the concentrations of propionate and total volatile fatty acids that were produced by sel. ruminantium h18 but did not alter end-product formation of m. elsdenii or cellulolytic bacteria. treatment with yeast culture increased the initial rate but not the extent of cellulose digestion by f. succinogenes s85 and ruminococcus flavefaciens fd1. collectively, these results suggest that yeast culture provides soluble growth factors (i.e., organic acids, b vitamins, and amino acids) that stimulate growth  of ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.

TI  == a survey of peptidase activity in rumen bacteria.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of 14 species of rumen bacteria were screened for their ability to hydrolyse ala2, ala5, glyarg-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (glyarg-mna) and leu-mna. several species, notably megasphaera elsdenii, were active against ala2, and a smaller number, including bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, lachnospira multipara and ruminobacter amylophilus, broke down ala5. streptococcus bovis had an exceptionally high leucine arylamidase activity. however, only ba. ruminicola hydrolysed glyarg-mna. further investigation revealed that only ba. ruminicola and bu. fibrisolvens hydrolysed ala5 to ala3 and ala2, with little ala4 being produced, in a manner similar to rumen fluid. the activity of ba. ruminicola against synthetic peptidase substrates, including glyarg-mna, lysala-mna, argarg-mna, glypro-mna, leuval-mna, and ala3-p-nitroanilide, was similar to that of rumen fluid, whereas  the activity of bu. fibrisolvens was quite different. since the main mechanism by which peptides are broken down in the rumen is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type i, for which glyarg-mna is a diagnostic substrate, it was concluded that ba. ruminicola was the most important single species in peptide breakdown in the rumen.

TI  == antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == a metabolite of trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. to standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using escherichia coli atcc 11775. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees c was generally less than 10  micrograms x ml-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for megasphaera elsdenii b159 and streptococcus bovis pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. in general, the gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the gram positive. the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms x ml-1; for b. ruminicola ga33  (glucose), b. succinogenes s85 (cellobiose), and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram x ml-1. when added to a cellulose-containing rumen  fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms x ml-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by b. succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, and r. flavefaciens fd1  for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms x ml-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. in the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains  net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of ph on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  == a total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium hd4, megasphaera elsdenii b159, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens a38, streptococcus bovis jb1, lactobacillus vitulinus ga1, bacteroides ruminicola b14, b. ruminicola ga33, ruminococcus albus 7, ruminococcus flavefaciens c94, and bacteroides succinogenes s85, were grown in energy-limiteh of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 ph units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the  culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and ph were determined. a low ph appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. large variations were seen  among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower ph values and in the ph at which the culture washed out. lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of ph on the efficiency of protein synthesis  in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.

TI  == studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: bacteroides clostridiiformis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, enbacterium limosum, fusobacterium necrophorum, megasphaera elsdenii, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens. clostridium pasteurianum and escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. all species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only c. pasteurianum, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, and m. elsdenii produced hydrogen  from dithionite. all species except e. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but  activity was low or absent in extracts of e. limosum, f. necrophorum, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. hydrogen was produced from  formate only by e. coli, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, f. necrophorum, and r.  flavefaciens. extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. the hydrogenase of all species except e. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with deae-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. it is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
