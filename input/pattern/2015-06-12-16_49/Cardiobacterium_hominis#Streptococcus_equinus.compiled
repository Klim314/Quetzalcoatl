TI  - Activity of DX-619 compared to other agents against viridans group streptococci,  Streptococcus bovis, and Cardiobacterium hominis.
AB  - Against 198 viridans group streptococci, 25 Streptococcus bovis strains, and 5 Cardiobacterium hominis strains, MICs of DX-619, a des-F(6)-quinolone, were between 0.004 and 0.25 microg/ml. These MICs were lower than those of other quinolones (< or = 0.008 to > 32 microg/ml). Beta-lactam MICs were between < or = 0.008 and 16 microg/ml. Azithromycin resistance was found in most species, while most were telithromycin susceptible. Glycopeptides and linezolid were active against viridans group strains but inactive against C. hominis.
TI  - Optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - This paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. In an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good patient outcome. The guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued by the American Heart Association. While most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. Patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential outcome if endocarditis develops. For oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. For gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. For high-risk patients, intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. For moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. Treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. Approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. Other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly Enterococcusfaecalis and E. faecium) and the HACEK group of organisms (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, Actinobacillus [Haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae). In general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or Streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. A 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. When endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or S. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. For staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. In prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. For all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). Finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.
TI  - Use of corticosteroids in glomerulonephritis related to infective endocarditis: three cases and review.
AB  - We report the cases of three patients treated for infective endocarditis (IE) for whom corticosteroids were added to the antibiotic treatment. They all had clinical and biological evidence of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. The microorganisms responsible for IE were Coxiella burnetii, Streptococcus bovis, and Cardiobacterium hominis. Median duration of IE before antimicrobial therapy was 7 months. In all patients, renal function deteriorated despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment for a mean duration of 16 days, but it improved after addition of corticosteroid therapy. All patients were cured of IE. A literature review revealed four additional cases of IE-related glomerulonephritis in which adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy was considered to be effective. Although corticosteroid therapy is generally not recommended for IE, it should be considered for patients whose renal dysfunction secondary to glomerulonephritis does not improve with appropriate antimicrobial treatment, especially if the duration of the illness is long.
