TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == in vitro activity of u-57930e against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of u-57930e, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. the mic (micrograms/ml) of u-57930e that inhibited 95% bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus prevotii, b. melaninogenicus and  p. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, b. vulgatus, propionibacterium and peptococcus species. clindamycin, on the other hand, gave mic values of 0.5 microgram/ml for b. fragilis, p. prevotii and p. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for propionibacterium sp. all strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of u-57930e. both clindamycin and  u-57930e showed similar mic values for all strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes tested. the mic values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and  tetracycline were within the expected range. u-57930e had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower mic than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == [antibacterial effects of niridazole. ii. effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. first, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as salmonella and escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole  is completely ineffective. there exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. the in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides spp., clostridium spp., fusobacterium spp. and peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. extremely low mic values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are  also relatively resistant to niridazole.

TI  == rapid temperature programmed gas-liquid chromatography of volatile fatty acids (c1-c7) for the identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a gas liquid chromatography method for the separation of 10 volatile fatty acids  (c1-c7 and isomers) has been improved by using oven temperature programmed conditions. in our conditions, the proprietary stationary phase sp 1220 introduced by supelco inc., gave sharp separation of volatile fatty acids in less than 8 min. this method was suitable for analyses with both thermal conductivity  and flame ionization detectors.

TI  == anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  == twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 bacteroides sp (11 in the b fragilis group); four anaerobic gram-positive cocci; four clostridium sp; four propionibacterium acnes; and three fusobacterium sp. no aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. the gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to bacteroides organisms, four to clostridium  sp, and one to f nucleatum. the ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals  of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to peptococcus sp and two to  fusobacterium sp. five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by b fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by p acnes. the average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). the early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

TI  == [susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

TI  == isolation and identification of fecal bacteria from adult swine.
AB  == an examination of the fecal microflora of adult swine was made with regard to the efficiency of several roll tube media in enumeration and recovery of anaerobes, the effects of medium constituents on recovery, and the isolation and identification of the predominant kinds of bacteria. total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4.48 x 10(10) to 7.40 x 10(10) bacteria/g (wet weight). comparison of different nonselective roll  tube media indicated that about 30% of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40%, vol/vol) medium (m98-5). recoveries of 21 and 15%, respectively, were obtained with m10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (rgca) media. rumen fluid, trypticase, sugars, and co2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with m98-5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or m10 plus swine cecal extract. significantly lower recoveries were observed with rcga, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from roll tube media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, eubacterium sp., clostridium sp., and propionibacterium acnes. the remainder of the flora (8%) included several other species of anaerobes and escherichia coli.  rumen fluid (or volatile fatty acids), trypticase, and yeast extract additions to basal media stimulated the growth of anaerobic strains. variation in the relative proportions of the predominant fecal microflora was observed. this work indicates that satisfactory enumeration, isolation and cultivation of the predominant microflora in swine feces can be obtained when strict anaerobic culture methods and a rumen fluid medium are used.

TI  == a special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.
