TI  == new erwinia-like organism causing cervical lymphadenitis.
AB  == the first case of cervical lymphadenitis due to infection by a new erwinia-like organism is reported. the organism was identified initially as pantoea sp. by a vitek 2-based assessment but was finally identified as a member of the genus erwinia by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the isolate displayed 98.9% 16s rrna  gene sequence similarity to that of e. tasmaniensis and showed phenotypic characteristics that were different from other erwinia species.
