TI  == the role of acidification in the inhibition of neisseria gonorrhoeae by vaginal lactobacilli during anaerobic growth.
AB  == background: vaginal lactobacilli protect the female genital tract by producing lactic acid, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide or a local immune response. in bacterial vaginosis, normal lactobacilli are replaced by an anaerobic flora and this may increase susceptibility to neisseria gonorrhoeae, a facultative anaerobe. bacterial interference between vaginal lactobacilli and n. gonorrhoeae  has not been studied in liquid medium under anaerobic conditions. by co-cultivating n. gonorrhoeae in the presence of lactobacilli we sought to identify the relative contributions of acidification and hydrogen peroxide production to any growth inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae. methods: three strains of  n. gonorrhoeae distinguishable by auxotyping were grown in the presence of high concentrations (107-108 cfu/ml) of three vaginal lactobacilli (l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii) in an anerobic liquid medium with and without 2-(n-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic (mes) buffer. fusobacterium nucleatum was used as an indicator of anaerobiosis. bacterial counts were performed at 15, 20 and 25 h; at 25 h ph and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured. results: growth of f. nucleatum to >108 cfu/ml at 25 h confirmed anaerobiosis. all bacteria grew in  the anaerobic liquid medium and the addition of mes buffer had negligible effect  on growth. l. crispatus and l. gasseri produced significant acidification and a corresponding reduction in growth of n. gonorrhoeae. this inhibition was abrogated by the addition of mes. l. jensenii produced less acidification and did not inhibit n. gonorrhoeae. hydrogen peroxide was not detected in any experiment. conclusions: during anaerobic growth, inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae by the vaginal lactobacilli tested was primarily due to acidification and abrogated by the presence of a buffer. there was no evidence of a specific mechanism of inhibition other than acid production under these conditions and, in particular, hydrogen peroxide was not produced. the acidification potential of vaginal lactobacilli under anaerobic conditions may be their most important characteristic conferring  protection against n. gonorrhoeae infection.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
