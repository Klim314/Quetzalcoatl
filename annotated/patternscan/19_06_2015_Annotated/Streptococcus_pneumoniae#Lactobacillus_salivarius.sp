TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == purification of bacteriocin ls1 produced by human oral isolate lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == introduction: lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, and salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. the objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named ls1, produced by l. salivarius bgho1. methods: a simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis (sds-page), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. results: the supernatant of l. salivarius bgho1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees c in an autoclave. bacteriocin ls1 was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of bacteriocin ls1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kda, based on tricine sds-page. during purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by l. salivarius bgho1, was detected. the molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kda, based on tricine sds-page. conclusion: our results imply that ls1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by l. salivarius strains. the purification of bacteriocin ls1 enabled the further characterization of ls1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
