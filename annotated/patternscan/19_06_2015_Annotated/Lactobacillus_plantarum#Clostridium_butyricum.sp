TI  == effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on ruminal ph, volatile fatty acids and bacterial flora of holstein calves.
AB  == twelve ruminally cannulated holstein calves (age, 12 +/- 3 weeks) were used to identify the effect of a probiotic comprised of lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium and clostridium butyricum on ruminal components. the calves  were adapted to a diet containing a 50% high-concentrate (standard diet) for 1 week, and then, the probiotic was given once daily for 5 days (day 1-5) at 1.5 or 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to groups of four calves each. four additional calves fed the standard diet without probiotic served as the corresponding control. ruminal ph was measured continuously throughout the 15-day experimental period. ruminal fluid was collected via a fistula at a defined time predose and on days 7 and 14 to assess volatile fatty acid (vfa), lactic acid and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations, as well as the bacterial community. the probiotic at either dose  improved the reduced 24-hr mean ruminal ph in calves. the circadian patterns of the 1 hr mean ruminal ph were identical between the probiotic doses. in both probiotic groups, ruminal lactic acid concentrations remained significantly lower than that of the control. probiotic did not affect ruminal vfa concentrations. l. plantarum and c. butyricum were not detected in the rumen of calves given the high-dose probiotic, whereas enterococcus spp. remained unchanged. these results  suggest that calves given a probiotic had stable ruminal ph levels (6.6-6.8), presumably due to the effects of the probiotic on stabilizing rumen-predominant bacteria, which consume greater lactate in the rumen.

TI  == immune-stimulatory effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on peripheral leukocyte  subpopulations and cytokine mrna expression levels in scouring holstein calves.
AB  == subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes and cytokine mrna expression levels were  evaluated in scouring and healthy holstein calves (age 10 +/- 5 days; n=42) treated with a probiotic consisting of lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium and clostridium butyricum. the calves were assigned to the scouring or healthy group and then subdivided into pathogen-positive treated (n=8), pathogen-positive control (n=8), pathogen-negative treated (n=6), pathogen-negative control (n=6), healthy treated (n=6) and healthy control (n=8)  groups. a single dose of the probiotic (3.0 g/100 kg body weight) was given to each calf in the treatment groups for 5 days. blood samples were collected on the first day of scour occurrence (day 0) and on day 7. in the scouring calves, smaller peripheral leukocyte subpopulations and cytokine mrna expression levels were noted on day 0. the numbers of cd3(+) t cells; cd4(+), cd8(+) and wc1(+) gammadelta t cell subsets; and cd14(+), cd21(+) and cd282(+) (tlr2) cells were significantly increased in the scouring and healthy treated calves on day 7. furthermore, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma mrna expression was elevated in the peripheral leukocytes of the scouring and healthy  treated calves on day 7. the scouring calves given the probiotic recovered on day 7. a significantly smaller number of peripheral leukocytes and lower cytokine mrna expression level might be induced by scouring in calves. repeated probiotic  administration might stimulate cellular immunity and encourage recovery from scouring in pre-weaning holstein calves.

TI  == effects of a bacteria-based probiotic on subpopulations of peripheral leukocytes  and their cytokine mrna expression in calves.
AB  == eight holstein calves (10 +/- 3 weeks) were used to examine the interaction between a bacteria-based probiotic agent (probiotic) and the function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the probiotic, consisting of lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecium and clostridium butyricum, was administered orally at 3.0 g/100 kg body weight to calves once daily for 5 consecutive days. calves given the vehicle alone with no probiotic served as the  control. in the treatment group, increases in numbers of cd282(+) (tlr2) monocytes, cd3(+) t cells and cd4(+), cd8(+) and wc1(+) gammadelta t cell subsets were noted on day 7 post-placement compared to predose day and the control group. expression of interleukin (il)-6, interferon-gamma (inf-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) was elevated in peripheral leukocytes on days 7 and 14.  these results suggest that peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy calves may be stimulated via the gastrointestinal microbiota, which was increased by the oral probiotic treatment, with overall stability of the rumen bacterial flora. the 5-day repeated administration of a bacteria-based probiotic may enhance cellular  immune function in weaned calves.

TI  == human intestinal microbiota: characterization of a simplified and stable gnotobiotic rat model.
AB  == the study of host microbe interactions is hampered by the complexity and inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota. therefore, a simplified human intestinal microbiota (sihumi) consisting of seven bacterial species was introduced into germfree rats. species selection was based on numerical importance and fermentative abilities in the human gut. association of the rats with the sihumi (anaerostipes caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium longum, blautia producta, clostridium ramosum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum) resulted in increased faecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids compared to germfree animals. since the faecal butyrate concentration was low (0.9 +/- 0.5 micromol/g dry matter) the sihumi was complemented with clostridium butyricum. this extended bacterial community (sihumix) led to an increased faecal butyrate concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.7 micromol/g dry matter. besides forming scfa, the sihumix was capable of degrading mucins, beta-aspartylglycine and bilirubin. these features are characteristic of  conventional animals but not observed in germfree animals. dietary interventions  with modifications in fibre and fat content led to changes in the proportion of community members. the relative increase of one member of this community in response to a high-fat diet reflects the situation reported for obese mice and human subjects. the strength of the model communities is their remarkable stability over time and their easy transfer to the offspring.

TI  == quality of silages from italian farms as attested by number and identity of microbial indicators.
AB  == aims: this study evaluated the quality and possible hygiene risks related to farm-made silages by analysing the presence and number of micro-organisms that influence the preservation and safety in samples from four italian regions. methods and results: lactic acid bacteria, clostridia, lactate-fermenting yeasts  and propionibacteria (pab) were isolated and identified by random amplified polymorphic dna pcr, sequencing of the v2-v3 16s rrna gene region, 5.8s-its rdna  rflp and species-specific pcr. the lactobacillus plantarum cluster was the most numerous and comprised strains mostly isolated from alfalfa silage. the lactobacillus buchneri cluster, second in number, comprised isolates from both alfalfa and maize silage. anaerobic spore formers were assigned to the species clostridium baratii, clostridium beijerinkii, clostridium butyricum, clostridium  perfringens, clostridium saccharolyticum, clostridium tyrobutyricum and paenibacillus macerans. yeast isolates were identified as candida apicola, candida mesenterica and pichia fermentans. pab strains, detected only in unifeed, were all identified as propionibacterium acidipropionici. conclusions: the occurrence of spoiling micro-organisms was frequent and the possibility of contamination by potentially pathogenic clostridia was demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest the need for improved ensiling practices and appropriate control measures to safeguard the hygienic and nutritional quality of silages produced in farms.

TI  == [evaluation of the bacterial flora in natural corn silage].
AB  == silage is the best method for forage conservation, keeping it in a fresh condition and with high nutrient content. in order to study the natural evolution of maize silage without additives during 50 days after sealed, ph, temperature changes, number and type of the indigenous bacteria were studied every 5 days. the initial ph decreased from 6.40 to 4.10 and temperature stabilized at 26 degrees c. the mesophilic aerobic bacteria were quickly reduced across time. enterococci were descended gradually. clostridia remained in a low quantity. the  microorganisms most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, clostridium butyricum, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum; this acid lactic bacteria was the principal cause of the abundant production of anaerobic fermentation of sugars in the forage reaching the ph which maintained the silage  in adequate conditions.
