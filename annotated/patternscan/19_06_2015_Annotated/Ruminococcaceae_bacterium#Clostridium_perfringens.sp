TI  == diet is a major factor governing the fecal butyrate-producing community structure across mammalia, aves and reptilia.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria have an important role in maintaining host health. they are well studied in human and medically associated animal models; however, much less is known for other vertebrata. we investigated the butyrate-producing community in hindgut-fermenting mammalia (n = 38), aves (n = 8) and reptilia (n = 8) using a gene-targeted pyrosequencing approach of the terminal genes of the main butyrate-synthesis pathways, namely butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). most animals exhibit high gene abundances, and clear diet-specific signatures were detected with but genes significantly enriched in omnivores and herbivores compared with carnivores. but dominated the  butyrate-producing community in these two groups, whereas buk was more abundant in many carnivorous animals. clustering of protein sequences (5% cutoff) of the combined communities (but and buk) placed carnivores apart from other diet groups, except for noncarnivorous carnivora, which clustered together with carnivores. the majority of clusters (but: 5141 and buk: 2924) did not show close relation to any reference sequences from public databases (identity <90%) demonstrating a large 'unknown diversity'. each diet group had abundant signature taxa, where buk genes linked to clostridium perfringens dominated in carnivores and but genes associated with ruminococcaceae bacterium d16 were specific for herbivores and omnivores. whereas 16s rrna gene analysis showed similar overall patterns, it was unable to reveal communities at the same depth and resolution as the functional gene-targeted approach. this study demonstrates that butyrate producers are abundant across vertebrates exhibiting great functional redundancy  and that diet is the primary determinant governing the composition of the butyrate-producing guild.

TI  == two necrotic enteritis predisposing factors, dietary fishmeal and eimeria infection, induce large changes in the caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  == it is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following clostridium perfringens infection. however, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. we analysed caecal microbiota  of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16s rdna amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed  and eimeria infected chicks. we found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of c. perfringens infection. we noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable lactobacillus counts remained stable. the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, unknown clostridiales and lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (otus) that had previously been linked to crohn's disease and reductions in otus known to be butyrate producers. eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown clostridium species were increased in abundance. additionally, eimeria did not significantly influence changes in ph, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. both fishmeal feeding and eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.
