TI  == safety evaluation of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis uo 004, a probiotic  bacterium.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis uo 004 was evaluated for its use as a potential probiotic from a safety point of view. the strain did not exhibit mucinolytic or other enzymatic activities that might be detrimental, such as those involving glycosidases (beta-d-glucosaminidase or alpha-d-galactosidase) or arylamidases (factor xa and quimotrypsin-like activities), frequently present in  lactobacillus strains isolated from patients with endocarditis, although it was able to express protein ca and kallikrein-like activities. on the other hand, the presence of the strain did not interfere with the growth of certain species of normal intestinal microbiota, such as enterococcus fecalis, escherichia coli, bifidobacterium bifidum or bacteroides fragilis. moreover, the potential probiotic strain uo 004 is sensitive to antibiotics with transmissible resistance mechanisms in lactobacillus such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and vancomycin. in addition, strain l. delbrueckii uo 004 was not able to translocate towards the intestinal barrier of mice or produce changes in their activity or general health status.
