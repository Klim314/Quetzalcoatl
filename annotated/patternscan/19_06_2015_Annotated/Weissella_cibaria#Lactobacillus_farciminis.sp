TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in suan-tsai and fu-tsai, traditional fermented mustard products of taiwan.
AB  == fu-tsai and suan-tsai are spontaneously fermented mustard products traditionally  prepared by the hakka tribe of taiwan. we chose 5 different processing stages of  these products for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by 16s rrna gene sequencing. from 500 lab isolates we identified 119 representative strains belonging to 5 genera and 18 species, including enterococcus (1 species), lactobacillus (11 species), leuconostoc (3 species), pediococcus (1 species), and weissella (2 species). the lab composition of mustard fermented for 3 days, known as the mu sample, was the most diverse, with  11 different lab species being isolated. we used sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene to identify the lab strains and analysis of the dnaa, phes, and rpoa genes to identify 13 lab strains for which identification by 16s rrna gene sequences was not possible. these 13 strains were found to belong to 5 validated  known species: lactobacillus farciminis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, weissella cibaria, and weissella paramesenteroides, and 5 possibly novel lactobacillus species. these results revealed that there is a high level of diversity in lab at the different stages of fermentation in the production of suan-tsai and fu-tsai.
