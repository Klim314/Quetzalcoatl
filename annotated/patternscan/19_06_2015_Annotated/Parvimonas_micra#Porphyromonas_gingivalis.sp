TI  == morbidly obese patient with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related cirrhosis who died from sepsis caused by dental infection of porphyromonas gingivalis: a case report.
AB  == non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) is associated with increased risks of developing lifestyle-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cerebral vessel disease. while the two-hit hypothesis and, recently,  multiple parallel hits hypothesis of nash pathogenesis were proposed, further details have not emerged. recently, dental infection of porphyromonas gingivalis  (p. gingivalis) has been reported as a critical risk factor for nash progression, which acts as multiple parallel hits to induce inflammation and fibrogenic responses in steatosis. we describe here a 54-year-old woman who died from sepsis and was diagnosed with nash. briefly, her body mass index (bmi) at the age of 35  years old had been 25.6 kg/m2 , but she became obese after withdrawing into her home at the age of 45 years. severe obesity continued over 19 years without diabetes mellitus. she was admitted to our hospital due to a sudden disturbance of consciousness. on admission, her bmi was 48.5 kg/m2 . computed tomography revealed cirrhotic liver with massive ascites, and laboratory data indicated increased inflammatory responses, renal failure and c grade child-pugh classification, suggesting the diagnosis of sepsis. also, severe periodontal disease was present, because the patient's front teeth fell out easily during intubation. although the focus of infection was not specified, the oral flora parvimonas micra, a periodontal pathogen, was detected in venous blood. in spite  of intensive care including artificial respiration management and continuous hemodiafiltration, she died on the 43rd day after admission. surprisingly, p. gingivalis was detected in her hepatocytes. this case may represent the significance of p. gingivalis in the progress to cirrhosis in nash patients.

TI  == quantitation of biofilm and planktonic life forms of coexisting periodontal species.
AB  == background: complexity of oral polymicrobial communities has prompted a need for  developing in vitro models to study behavior of coexisting bacteria. little knowledge is available of in vitro co-growth of several periodontitis-associated  species without early colonizers of dental plaque. the aim: was to determine temporal changes in the quantities of six periodontal species in an in vitro biofilm model in comparison with parallel planktonic cultures. material and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus and fusobacterium nucleatum were anaerobically grown as multispecies and monospecies biofilms and parallel planktonic cultures using cell culture plates and microfuge tubes, respectively. after incubating 2, 4, 6, 8 days, biofilms and planktonic cultures  were harvested, dna extracted and the target species quantified using qpcr with species-specific 16s rdna primers. biofilm growth as monocultures was visualized  at day 2 and 8 with confocal microscopy and crystal violet staining. results: the six species were found throughout the test period in all culture conditions, except that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were not detected in multispecies planktonic cultures at day 8. in multispecies biofilm, p. gingivalis qpcr counts  (cells/ml) increased (p<0.05) from day 2-8 and were then higher (p<0.05) than those of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, whereas in monospecies biofilm,  p. gingivalis counts were lower (p<0.05) than those of the other species, except  a. actinomycetemcomitans. when multi- and monospecies biofilm cultures were compared, p. gingivalis counts were higher (p<0.05) but those of the other species, except p. intermedia, lower (p<0.05) in multispecies biofilm. comparison between planktonic and biofilm cultures showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  micra and c. rectus had higher (p<0.05) counts in planktonic cultures no matter whether grown in mono- or multispecies environment. conclusions: six periodontal  species were able to form multispecies biofilm up to 8 days in vitro without pioneer plaque bacteria. p. gingivalis seemed to prefer multispecies biofilm environment whereas p. micra and a. actinomycetemcomitans planktonic culture.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == combinations of bacterial species associated with symptomatic endodontic infections in a chinese population.
AB  == aim: to use microarrays to detect 11 selected bacteria in infected root canals, revealing bacterial combinations that are associated with clinical symptoms and signs of primary endodontic infections in a chinese population. methodology: dna  was extracted from 90 samples collected from the root canals of teeth with primary endodontic infections in a chinese population, and the 16s rrna gene was  amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were hybridized to microarrays containing specific oligonucleotide probes targeting 11 species, and  the arrays were screened with a confocal laser scanner. pearson's chi-squared test and cluster analysis were performed to investigate the associations between  the bacterial combinations and clinical symptoms and signs using sas 8.02. results: seventy-seven samples (86%) yielded at least one of the 11 target species. parvimonas micra (56%), porphyromonas endodontalis (51%), tannerella forsythia (48%), prevotella intermedia (44%) and porphyromonas gingivalis (37%) were the most prevalent taxa and were often concomitant. the following positive associations were found between the bacterial combinations and clinical features: p. endodontalis and t. forsythia with abscess; p. gingivalis and p. micra with sinus tract; p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis or p. micra and p. endodontalis with abscess and sinus tract; and the combination of p. endodontalis, p. micra, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis with sinus tract (p < 0.05). conclusions: various  combinations of p. micra, p. endodontalis, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis may contribute to abscesses or sinus tracts of endodontic origin with bacterial synergism in a chinese population.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == [study of association between parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of parvimonas micra (pm) and the associations  between pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. methods: a  total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. the teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial dna was undertaken. the pm 16s rdna level was evaluated using 16s rdna pcr. the prevalence of pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. then, the associations of pm and enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe) as well as porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were analysed. results: pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. the prevalences  of pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, p < 0.05). significant correlations (untreated group or = 5.98, root-canal-treated group or = 33.50) between pm and pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between pm and pg as well as ef were not of significance, respectively. conclusions: a significantly higher relevance ratio of pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. pm and pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.

TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == high-level antimicrobial efficacy of representative mediterranean natural plant extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == nature is an unexplored reservoir of novel phytopharmaceuticals. since biofilm-related oral diseases often correlate with antibiotic resistance, plant-derived antimicrobial agents could enhance existing treatment options. therefore, the rationale of the present report was to examine the antimicrobial impact of mediterranean natural extracts on oral microorganisms. five different extracts from olea europaea, mastic gum, and inula viscosa were tested against ten bacteria and one candida albicans strain. the extraction protocols were conducted according to established experimental procedures. two antimicrobial assays--the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) assay--were applied. the screened extracts were  found to be active against each of the tested microorganisms. o. europaea presented mic and mbc ranges of 0.07-10.00 mg ml(-1) and 0.60-10.00 mg ml(-1), respectively. the mean mbc values for mastic gum and i. viscosa were 0.07-10.00 mg ml(-1) and 0.15-10.00 mg ml(-1), respectively. extracts were less effective against c. albicans and exerted bactericidal effects at a concentration range of  0.07-5.00 mg ml(-1) on strict anaerobic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and parvimonas micra). ethyl acetate i. viscosa extract and total mastic extract showed considerable antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms and could therefore be considered as alternative natural anti-infectious agents.

TI  == quantitative analysis of classical and new putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm: a case-control study.
AB  == background and objectives: a number of species/phylotypes have been newly implicated as putative periopathogens. the objective of this study was to explore associations among classical and new pathogens in subgingival biofilm and to assess their relative importance to chronic periodontitis. material and methods:  pooled subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis and 40 healthy controls. taqman q-pcr assays were used to determine the absolute and relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, oral synergistetes and oral tm7s. microbial associations were assessed using cluster analysis. different statistical models were used to explore associations between  microbial parameters and periodontitis. results: the median log and relative counts were lowest for tm7s (4.4 and 0.0016%, respectively) and highest for oral  synergistetes (7.2 and 1.4%, respectively). oral synergistetes clustered strongly with the red complex, particularly t. forsythia (100% rescaled similarity). all species/phylotypes except tm7s were significantly associated with periodontitis (mann-whitney test; p </= 0.005). however, p. gingivalis and f. alocis lost association after adjusting for confounders (ordinal regression). in receiving operator characteristic curve analysis, the log counts of oral synergistetes were the best markers of periodontitis (82.5% sensitivity and specificity), followed by those of t. forsythia, p. micra and t. denticola. in prediction analysis, however, p. micra was the only microbial predictor of periodontal parameters. conclusions: oral synergistetes are presented here as new members of the red complex, with relative importance to periodontitis exceeding that of the classical members. p. micra is shown as an important periodontal pathogen warranting more attention.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == oral cavity anaerobic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.
AB  == background: a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method has been used to identify oral anaerobic pathogens in biofilms on voice prostheses. the purpose of the present study was to determine the location of those pathogens inside the biofilms. methods: biofilms of 15 voice prostheses were sampled and used to identify the oral pathogens. fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied on smears made on glass slides and on sections of intact biofilms visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) was the most frequently detected pathogen and the only tested species  detected in microcolonies. the other microbes (parvimonas micra [p. micra], porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia], and treponema denticola [t. denticola]) were not detected or only detected as single cells. clsm analysis showed that f. nucleatum resided on the biofilm surface. conclusion: although detectable, oral anaerobic pathogens seem to be no  more than passers-by that adhere without further observed proliferation and apparently play no striking role in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.

TI  == bacteria community study of combined periodontal-endodontic lesions using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing analysis.
AB  == background: the entire microbial population and predominant microflora of root canals (rcs) and adjacent periodontal pockets (pps) from teeth with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions were determined and compared. methods: pooled rc and pp samples were collected from the molars of 20 patients diagnosed with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions. dna was extracted for polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), cloning, and sequence analysis. a coefficient of similarity (cs) was used to determine the similarity of the bacterial profiles from rcs and pps. results: significantly fewer bands were produced by pcr-dgge from rcs (5.9 +/- 1.7) than from pps (8.0 +/- 1.8) (p <0.001). the average cs of the rc and pp samples was 93.81% +/- 10.26%. overall, 60 genera/species were identified by sequencing. of these, the predominant genera in rcs were porphyromonas sp. (13.9%), filifactor sp. (12.5%), and parvimonas sp. (11.1%), similar to the genera obtained from pp samples. in total, 43 genera/species were common to the rc and pp samples. the most prevalent bacteria in both the rc and pp samples were (in descending order) filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the high similarity in the sets of organisms present in both rc and  pp samples in this study suggests that the pocket could be a source of rc infection. the data also demonstrate that combined periodontal-endodontic lesions consist of a diverse and complex microbial community.

TI  == beta-lactamic resistance profiles in porphyromonas, prevotella, and parvimonas species isolated from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: susceptibility to beta-lactamic agents has changed among anaerobic  isolates from acute endodontic infections. the aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene in prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., and parviomonas micra strains and show its phenotypic expression. methods:  root canal samples from teeth with acute endodontic infections were collected and porphyromonas, prevotella, and parvimonas micra strains were isolated and microbiologically identified with conventional culture techniques. the susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration of benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin + clavulanate using the e-test method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). the presence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was determined through primer-specific polymerase chain reaction. the nitrocefin test was used to determine the expression of the lactamase enzyme. results: prevotella disiens, prevotella oralis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and p.  micra strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin  + clavulanate. the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was detected in 2 of 29 isolates (6.9%). simultaneous detection of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene and lactamase production was observed for 1 prevotella buccalis strain. the gene was in 1 p. micra strain but  was not expressed. three strains were positive for lactamase production, but the  cfxa/cfxa2 gene was not detected through polymerase chain reaction. conclusions:  there is a low prevalence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene and its expression in porphyromonas spp., prevotella spp., and p. micra strains isolated from acute endodontic infections. genetic and phenotypic screening must be performed simultaneously to best describe additional mechanisms involved in lactamic resistance for strict anaerobes.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == comparative evaluation of subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and non-pregnant women: a clinical and microbiologic study.
AB  == context: gingival changes in pregnancy have been attributed to changes in the subgingival biofilm related to hormonal variations. aims: to evaluate the subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and nonpregnant women to determine if pregnancy induces any alterations in the subgingival plaque and to associate these changes with changes in periodontal status. settings and design: thirty pregnant and 10 nonpregnant women within the age group of 20-35 years having a probing pocket depth (ppd) of 3-4 mm were included in the study. the pregnant women were equally divided into 3 groups of 10, each belonging to i, ii, and iii  trimester. materials and methods: plaque index, gingival index, ppd, and microbiologic evaluation for specific bacterial counts for prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, parvimonas micra, and fusobacterium nucleatum were carried out for all subjects. statistical analysis: mann-whitney u test. results: increase in gingival inflammation was observed in ii and iii trimester as compared with i trimester and control. plaque scores did not show any significant difference between pregnant and nonpregnant women. specific bacterial examination revealed an increase in proportion of p. intermedia in pregnant women of both ii and iii trimester as compared with i trimester and nonpregnant women. conclusions: a definite increase in proportions  of p. intermedia occurs in subgingival plaque microflora in pregnancy that may be responsible for the exaggerated gingival response.

AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == effectiveness of three antimicrobial mouthrinses on the disinfection of toothbrushes stored in closed containers: a randomized clinical investigation by  dna checkerboard and culture.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the efficacy of three antimicrobial solutions on the disinfection of toothbrushes after storage in closed containers. materials and methods: sixteen healthy subjects were enrolled  in this randomized cross-over clinical investigation. the study was conducted in  four phases, in which mouthrinses (chlorhexidine gluconate-based or cetilpiridinium-based) and sterile tap water (control group) were used to individually store used toothbrushes in closed containers during 7 days of toothbrushing. five toothbrushes were used as negative control for bacterial colonisation before contact with oral cavity. conventional culture and dna checkerboard hybridization were used to detect bacterial contamination on the toothbrushes. subsequently, the number of bacterial species on the bristles was estimated by the dna checkerboard method. results: one toothbrush presented bacterial contamination in the negative control test. both culture and dna checkerboard showed positive signals of bacterial contamination in the toothbrushes with no differences in the frequency of detection. the control group showed higher total bacterial counts when compared with the mouthrinse groups. porphyromonas gingivalis had the highest bacterial count followed by parvimonas micra. conclusion: culture and dna checkerboard showed positive signals of bacterial contamination. mouthrinses that contains 0.12% of chlorhexidine gluconate were more effective in reducing bacterial colonisation on the toothbrushes.

TI  == comprehensive microbiological findings in peri-implantitis and periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial differences between peri-implantitis and periodontitis in the  same subjects were examined using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets of peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites in six subjects. the prevalence of bacteria was analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 333 different taxa were identified from 799 sequenced clones; 231 (69%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 75 were novel. the numbers of bacterial taxa identified at the sites of peri-implantitis and periodontitis were 192 and 148 respectively. the microbial composition of peri-implantitis was more diverse when compared with that of periodontitis. fusobacterium spp. and streptococcus spp. were predominant in both peri-implantitis and periodontitis, while bacteria such  as parvimonas micra were only detected in peri-implantitis. the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was not high, while quantitative evaluation revealed that, in most cases, prevalence was higher at peri-implantitis sites than at periodontitis sites. conclusions: the biofilm in peri-implantitis showed a more complex microbial composition when compared with periodontitis. common periodontopathic bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in peri-implantitis.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical  examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species.  statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp) integrates spirochaetes within oral microbial communities.
AB  == treponema denticola is found ubiquitously in the human oral cavity and is mainly  associated with bacterial communities implicated in the establishment and development of periodontal disease. the ability to become integrated within biofilm communities is crucial to the growth and survival of oral bacteria, and involves inter-bacterial coaggregation, metabolic cooperation, and synergy against host defences. in this article we show that the chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp), found within a high-molecular-mass complex on the cell surface, mediates adherence of t. denticola to other potential periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and parvimonas micra. proteolytic activity per se did not appear to be required for the interactions, and expression of the major outer-sheath protein (msp) was not necessary, except for binding parv. micra. biofilms of densely packed cells and matrix, up to 40 microm in depth, were formed between t. denticola and p. gingivalis on salivary pellicle, with t. denticola cells enriched in the upper layers. expression of ctlp, but not msp, was critical for dual-species biofilm formation with p. gingivalis. t. denticola did not form dual-species biofilms with any of the other three periodontal bacterial species under various conditions. synergy between t. denticola and p. gingivalis was also shown by increased inhibition of blood clotting, which was ctlp-dependent. the results demonstrate the critical role of ctlp in interactions of t. denticola with other oral micro-organisms, leading to synergy in microbial community development and host tissue pathogenesis.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == effectiveness of ozone against periodontal pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == ozone has been proposed as an adjunct antiseptic in periodontitis therapy. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of gaseous/aqueous ozone, in comparison with that of the established antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), against periodontal microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and parvimonas micra in planktonic or biofilm cultures were exposed, for 1 min, to gaseous ozone, aqueous ozone, chx, or phosphate-buffered saline (control). none of the agents was able to substantially reduce the a. actinomycetemcomitans count in biofilm cultures. in contrast, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. micra could be eliminated by 2% chx or by ozone gas at 53 gm(-3) . significantly greater antimicrobial effects were observed against planktonic cultures than against biofilm-associated bacteria. the rate of killing was influenced by the species of bacteria, and by the type and concentration of agent. there were no significant differences in the effectiveness of aqueous ozone (20 mug ml(-1) ) or gaseous ozone (>/= 4 gm(-3) ) compared with 2% chx but  they were more effective than 0.2% chx. therefore, high-concentrated gaseous and  aqueous ozone merit further investigation as antiseptics in periodontitis therapy. a safe system for applying gaseous ozone into the periodontal pocket that avoids inhalation still needs to be developed.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm from chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == aims: existing in vitro and in vivo data suggest that khat may have a favorable effect on periodontal microbiota. the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of khat chewing on major periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from subjects with chronic periodontitis. materials and methods: 40 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from periodontitis and healthy sites of  10 khat chewers (40 y median age) and 10 khat non-chewers (37.5 y median age) with chronic periodontitis. absolute and relative counts of 6 periodontal pathogens were determined in each sample using highly sensitive and specific taqman real-time pcr assays. data were analyzed using an ordinal regression model. results: significantly more total bacteria were detected in samples from the periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=20). treponema denticola was present at significantly higher absolute counts at the healthy as well as periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=3.13 and 13, respectively). however,  the khat chewers harbored significantly lower absolute counts of porphyromonas gingivalis at the healthy sites (or=0.07). furthermore, khat chewing was significantly associated with lower relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis,  fusobacterium ssp., prevotella ssp. and parvimonas micra-like species in subgingival plaque samples from both healthy and periodontitis sites (or=0.11-0.33). only treponema denticola was found in higher relative counts at the healthy sites of the khat chewers (or=2.98). conclusions: overall, there was  a lower burden of pathogens in the khat chewers. findings from the current study  are suggestive of a potential prebiotic effect for khat on periodontal microbiota.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of a genius nd:yag laser.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the 'in vitro' bactericidal effect of the nd:yag laser (genius, molsgaard dental, copenhagen, denmark) on six periodontal pathogens. methods: suspensions of six different periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra) were prepared in small eppendorff tubes, and exposed to a nd:yag laser for five different periods of time. laser settings used: power 6 watt (on a scale of 1-12 w), frequency 50 hz, pulse duration 250 mus. after exposure to the laser, aliquots of the suspensions were spread on blood agar plates for bacterial counting. results: after 5 s of laser exposure, there was a decrease in total colony forming units for all six selected microorganisms. after 15, 30 and 45 s, no viable bacterial cells could be retrieved. conclusion: in this 'in vitro' model, 15 s of nd:yag laser use was found to be effective for total killing of the six tested periodontal pathogens.

TI  == analysis of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis using 16s rrna gene clone library.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis (pi) is an inflammatory disease which leads to the destruction of soft and hard tissues around osseointegrated implants. the subgingival microbiota appears to be responsible for peri-implant lesions and although the complexity of the microbiota has been reported in pi, the microbiota responsible for pi has not been identified. objective: the purpose of this study  was to identify the microbiota in subjects who have pi, clinically healthy implants, and periodontitis-affected teeth using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis to clarify the microbial differences. design: three subjects participated in this study. the conditions around the teeth and implants were evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations and diseased implants,  clinically healthy implants, and periodontally diseased teeth were selected. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets using sterile paper points. prevalence and identity of bacteria was analyzed using a 16s rrna gene clone library technique. results: a total of 112 different species were identified from 335 clones sequenced. among the 112 species, 51 (46%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel phylotypes. the numbers of bacterial species identified at the sites of pi, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively. microbiota in pi mainly included gram-negative species and the composition was more diverse when compared to that of the healthy implant and periodontitis. the phyla chloroflexi, tenericutes, and synergistetes were only detected at pi sites, as were parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus stomatis, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and solobacterium moorei. low levels of periodontopathic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were seen in  peri-implant lesions. conclusions: the biofilm in pi showed a more complex microbiota when compared to periodontitis and periodontally healthy teeth, and it was mainly composed of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. common periodontopathic  bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in pi.

TI  == microbial profile of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the biofilm accumulated around ligatures in rats by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using  probes made from human oral bacterial species. methods: 12 wistar rats were selected for this study. one of the mandibular first molars of each animal received a ligature, while the contralateral tooth was left unligated to be used  as a control. forty-two days later, the ligatures and one sample of biofilm from  each unligated teeth were analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for 40 human periodontal species. the area of bone loss in the furcation area was determined histometrically. results: the unligated teeth did not present any of the bacterial species tested. twenty five species were detected in the ligatures. streptococcus- and actinomyces-like species were found in high mean counts, followed by fusobacterium-, prevotella nigrescens- and parvimonas micra-like species and porphyromonas gingivalis- and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-like species. greater bone loss was observed in the furcation area of the ligated than of the unligated group (p<0.0001). conclusion: at 42 days, the ligature biofilm in rats presents various bacterial species that  hybridize to probes of periodontal bacterial species commonly observed in human.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == the effect of a supragingival plaque-control regimen on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers: evaluation by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of strict supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota in smokers and never-smokers. research into the impact of supragingival plaque control on the number of subgingival bacteria has resulted in contradictory findings. real-time  polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been suggested as a valid alternative to current microbiologic methods based on bacteria cultures. methods: forty-five subjects with chronic periodontitis were selected. twenty-four of them had never  smoked, and 21 were active smokers. four sites per patient were selected for sampling. supragingival debridement was performed at baseline, and the subjects received weekly instructions on oral hygiene for 180 days. a clinical examination and subgingival plaque sampling were carried out at baseline and at 30, 90, and 180 days. a real-time pcr assay was used to detect and quantify porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas  micros), dialister pneumosintes, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and the total bacteria load (eubacteria) in the subgingival samples. statistical analysis was performed using linear models adjusted for the clustering of observations within individuals. results: smokers and never-smokers exhibited a similar and significant reduction  in total bacteria counts over time. irrespective of smoking status, deep sites consistently harbored greater quantities of total bacteria throughout the study.  higher numbers of the bacteria investigated were associated with bleeding on probing. conclusion: supragingival plaque control markedly reduced subgingival microbiota counts in smokers and never-smokers.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == periodontal microbiota in patients with coronary artery disease measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction: a case-control study.
AB  == background: recent data have shown that periodontal disease may increase the risk of occurrence of coronary heart disease in which inflammation initiated by bacteria and their compounds might be a common causal factor. this case-control study aimed at studying the relationship between periodontal disease and coronary artery disease (cad) based on clinical and periodontal microbiologic parameters.  methods: a total of 90 male subjects, 48 to 80 years of age, were included in this study. forty-five men had cad (cad+), which was confirmed by coronary angiography. forty-five age-matched controls showed no history or symptoms of cad (cad-). all subjects underwent a clinical periodontal examination including assessment of tooth loss, probing depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding  on probing. in the cad+ group, this examination took place 1 day before coronary  angiography. subgingival microbial samples were taken and evaluated by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) for the total amount of bacteria and the following periodontopathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra (formerly micromonas micros), dialister pneumosintes, and campylobacter rectus. results: compared to control subjects, cad+ subjects had significantly deeper pockets (2.28 mm versus 2.96 mm; p <0.001) and greater attachment loss (2.85 mm versus 3.65 mm; p <0.001), and this difference remained statistically significant after  adjusting for smoking. no significant differences were observed between cases and controls with regard to the number of teeth present. p. intermedia was the only periodontal pathogen that showed significantly higher mean counts in cad+ subjects compared to cad- subjects. higher counts of total bacteria, p. micra, d. pneumosintes, and c. rectus were found in the cad- group. conclusion: the results suggest that a relationship between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease exists, although p. intermedia was the only periodontopathogen related to cad.
