TI  == study in vitro of the impact of endophytic bacteria isolated from centella asiatica on the disease incidence caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus colletotrichum higginsianum.
AB  == thirty-one endophytic bacteria isolated from healthy leaves of centella asiatica  were screened in vitro for their ability to reduce the growth rate and disease incidence of colletotrichum higginsianum, a causal agent of anthracnose. isolates of cohnella sp., paenibacillus sp. and pantoea sp. significantly stimulated the growth rate of c. higginsianum mucl 44942, while isolates of achromobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., microbacterium sp., klebsiella sp. and pseudomonas putida had  no influence on this plant pathogen. by contrast, bacillus subtilis bca31 and pseudomonas fluorescens bca08 caused a marked inhibition of c. higginsianum mucl  44942 growth by 46 and 82 %, respectively. cell-free culture filtrates of b. subtilis bca31 and p. fluorescens bca08 were found to contain antifungal compounds against c. higginsianum mucl 44942. inoculation assays on in vitro-cultured plants of c. asiatica showed that foliar application of b. subtilis bca31, three days before inoculation with c. higginsianum mucl 44942, significantly reduced incidence and severity of the disease. the role of endophytic bacteria in maintaining the apparent inactivity of c. higginsianum mucl 44942 in c. asiatica grown in the wild is discussed.

TI  == [isolation, identification and characterization of acc deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria from halophyte suaeda salsa].
AB  == objective: we isolated and characterized 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc)  deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria from halophyte suaeda salsa to understand the interactions between endophytes and halophyte. methods: acc deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria were isolated from root, stalk and leaf  of suaeda salsa and were identified based on morphological, physiological-biochemical properties, api and 16s rrna sequence analysis. isolates were evaluated for their acc deaminase, antifungal, protease activity, siderophores and phytohormones, such as indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid production, as well as atmospheric nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization. results: four acc deaminase-containing endophytic bacteria strains named as lp11, ss12, tw1 and tw2 were isolated and identified as pseudomonas oryzihabitans, pseudomonas sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida respectively. all the strains possessed the phosphate-solubilizing ability and could produce siderophores and phytohormones more or less. none of them could fix atmospheric nitrogen or produce protease. only strain ss12 showed antagonism  against two phytopathogenic fungi viz fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans and  f. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. conclusion: acc deaminase-containing endophytic  bacteria of pseudomonas sp. and pantoea sp. isolated from halophyte suaeda salsa  have abundant biological characteristics related to plant growth promotion, stress homeostasis regulation and biocontrol activity.

TI  == biosynthesis of the vitamin e compound delta-tocotrienol in recombinant escherichia coli cells.
AB  == the biosynthesis of natural products in a fast growing and easy to manipulate heterologous host system, such as escherichia coli, is of increasing interest in  biotechnology. this procedure allows the investigation of complex natural product biosynthesis and facilitates the engineering of pathways. here we describe the cloning and the heterologous expression of tocochromanol (vitamin e) biosynthesis genes in e. coli. tocochromanols are synthesized solely in photosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, and higher green plants). for recombinant tocochromanol biosynthesis, the genes encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  (hpd), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (crte), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reductase (ggh), homogentisate phytyltransferase (hpt), and tocopherol-cyclase (cyc) were cloned in a stepwise fashion and expressed in e. coli. recombinant e.  coli cells were cultivated and analyzed for tocochromanol compounds and their biosynthesis precursors. the expression of only hpd from pseudomonas putida or crte from pantoea ananatis resulted in the accumulation of 336 mg l(-1) homogentisate and 84 microg l(-1) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in e. coli cultures. simultaneous expression of hpd, crte, and hpt from synechocystis sp. under the control of single tac-promoter resulted in the production of methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-benzoquinol (67.9 microg g(-1)). additional expression of the tocopherol cyclase gene vte1 from arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the novel  formation of a vitamin e compound-delta-tocotrienol (15 microg g(-1))-in e. coli.

TI  == arsenite oxidation by alcaligenes sp. strain rs-19 isolated from arsenic-contaminated mines in the republic of korea.
AB  == arsenite [as(iii)]-oxidizing bacteria play important roles in reducing arsenic [as] toxicity and mobility in as-contaminated areas. as-resistant bacteria were isolated from the soils of two abandoned mines in the republic of korea. the isolated bacteria showed relatively high resistances to as(iii) up to 26 mm. the  pcr-based 16s rrna analysis revealed that the isolated as-resistant bacteria were close relatives to serratia marcescensa, pseudomonas putida, pantoea agglomerans, and alcaligenes sp. among the five as-resistant bacterial isolates, alcaligenes sp. strain rs-19 showed the highest as(iii)-oxidizing activity in batch tests, completely oxidizing 1 mm of as(iii) to as(v) within 40 h during heterotrophic growth. this study suggests that the indigenous bacteria have evolved to retain the ability to resist toxic as in the as-contaminated environments and moreover to convert the species to a less toxic form [e.g., from as(iii) to as(v)] and also contribute the biogeochemical cycling of as by being involved in speciation  of as.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
