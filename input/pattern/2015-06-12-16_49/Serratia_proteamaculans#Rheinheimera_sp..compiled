TI  - Gallaecimonas pentaromativorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a bacterium carrying 16S rRNA gene heterogeneity and able to degrade high-molecular-mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
AB  - A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, halotolerant bacterium, designated strain CEE_131(T), which degraded high-molecular-mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of four and five rings, was isolated from intertidal sediment of Corcubion Ria in Cee, A Coruna, Spain. Direct sequencing showed ambiguities and suggested heterogeneity. Cloned 16S rRNA gene sequence PCR products yielded five different sequences varying at five positions. Strain CEE_131(T) showed rather distant relationships to its phylogenetically closest neighbours, including the genera Rheinheimera and Serratia , exhibiting 91 % sequence similarity with Rheinheimera perlucida BA131(T) and Serratia proteamaculans subsp. quinovora DSM 4597(T). The major fatty acids were C(16 : 1 )omega7c, C(16 : 0) and C(18 : 1)omega7c. The DNA G+C content was 41.7 mol%. On the basis of these distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, strain CEE_131(T) is considered to represent a novel species in a new genus in the class Gammaproteobacteria, for which the name Gallaecimonas pentaromativorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CEE_131(T) (=DSM 21945(T)=CECT 7479(T)).
