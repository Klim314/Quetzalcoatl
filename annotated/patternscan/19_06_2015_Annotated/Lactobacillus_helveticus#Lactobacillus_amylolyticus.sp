TI  == lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  == twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr banding patterns. five strains grouped with the type strains of lactobacillus gasseri (dsm 20077t) and lactobacillus jensenii (dsm 20557t) at r > or = 0.83 in  one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. however, numerical analysis of the rapd-pcr banding patterns of representative strains selected from the l. gasseri-l. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. four strains (tv 1010, tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045) grouped into another well separated protein  profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar rapd-pcr banding patterns and clustered at r2 > or = 0.78, separate  from the other strains examined. sequencing of the 16s rrna of two representative strains, tv 1018t and tg 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rrna group i lactobacillus, which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus iners, l. jensenii, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus hamsteri, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri and lactobacillus amylolyticus. the name lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains tv 1010 (dsm 13172), tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045, with strain tv 1018t (= dsm 13171t = atcc 700934t) as the type.

TI  == a polyphasic approach towards the identification of strains belonging to lactobacillus acidophilus and related species.
AB  == a set of 98 strains belonging to nine species of the lactobacillus acidophilus rrna-group have been analysed by sds-page of cellular proteins, rapd-pcr and aflp with fluorescently labeled primers in order to find improved methods for their identification. strains of the following phenotypically highly similar species were examined: l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, l. gallinarum, l. helveticus, l. iners and l. amylolyticus. although the majority of the species can be differentiated by sds-page of whole-cell proteins, the latter technique showed poor discrimination between l. gasseri and l. johnsonii strains and between some strains of l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum. however, this study shows that the rapd-pcr (using at least 3 different primers followed by numerical analysis of the combined patterns) and aflp are most suitable genomic fingerprinting techniques for the differentiation of all the species listed above, and that databases for identification can be constructed, particularly when commercially available molecular tool-kits are used. the separate species status of the recently described l. amylolyticus and l. iners was fully confirmed.
