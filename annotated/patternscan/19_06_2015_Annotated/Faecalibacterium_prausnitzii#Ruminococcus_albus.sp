TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  == cellobiose 2-epimerase (ce; ec 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-d-mannose in ruminococcus albus cells. here, we report a ce in a ruminal strain of eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. the nucleotide sequence of the ce had an orf of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 da). the ce from e. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to n-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of coprococcus eutactus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, clostridium phytofermentans, caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and eubacterium siraeum. surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a ce from r. albus. the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. the purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kda and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees c and ph 7.0-8.5. in addition to  cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-d-mannose).
