TI  == phylogeny of the ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria peptostreptococcus anaerobius, clostridium sticklandii, and clostridium aminophilum sp. nov.
AB  == in previous studies, gram-positive bacteria which grew rapidly with peptides or an amino acid as the sole energy source were isolated from bovine rumina. three isolates, strains c, ft (t = type strain), and sr, were considered to be ecologically important since they produced up to 20-fold more ammonia than other  ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. on the basis of phenotypic criteria, the taxonomic position of these new isolates was uncertain. in this study, the 16s rrna sequences of these isolates and related bacteria were determined to establish the phylogenetic positions of the organisms. the sequences of strains c, ft, and sr and reference strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, clostridium sticklandii, clostridium coccoides, clostridium aminovalericum, acetomaculum ruminis, clostridium leptum, clostridium lituseburense, clostridium acidiurici, and clostridium barkeri were determined by using a modified sanger dideoxy chain  termination method. strain c, a large coccus purported to belong to the genus peptostreptococcus, was closely related to p. anaerobius, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.6%. strain sr, a heat-resistant, short, rod-shaped organism, was closely related to c. sticklandii, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.9%. however, strain ft, a heat-resistant, pleomorphic, rod-shaped organism, was only distantly related to some clostridial species and p. anaerobius. on the basis of the sequence data, it was clear that strain ft warranted designation as a separate species. the closest known relative of strain ft was c. coccoides (level of similarity, only 90.6%). additional strains that are phenotypically similar to strain ft were isolated in this study.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
