TI  == mutually exclusive distribution of is1548 and gbsi1, an active group ii intron identified in human isolates of group b streptococci.
AB  == the present study shows that active, self-splicing group ii intron gbsi1 is located downstream of the c5a-peptidase gene, scpb, in some group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates that lack insertion sequence is1548. is1548 was previously reported to be often present at the scpb locus in gbs isolated in association with endocarditis. since none of 67 gbs isolates examined, 40 of which were of serotype iii, harbored both is1548 and gbsi1, these two elements are suggested to be markers for different genetic lineages in gbs serotype iii. the dna region downstream of scpb in gbs isolates harboring either gbsi1, is1548, or none of these mobile elements was found to encode the laminin binding protein, lmb, which shows sequence similarities to a family of streptococcal adhesins. is1548 is inserted 9 bp upstream of the putative promoter for lmb, while the insertion site for gbsi1 is located 88 bp further upstream. sequences highly similar to gbsi1 exist also in streptococcus pneumoniae. an inverted repeat sequence, with features typical of transcription terminators, was identified immediately upstream of the insertion site for the group ii intron both in the gbs and s. pneumoniae sequences. this motif is suggested to constitute a target for the gbs  intron as well as for rather closely related introns in bacillus halodurans, pseudomonas alcaligenes, and pseudomonas putida. when transcripts containing the  gbsi1 intron were incubated at high concentrations of ammonium and magnesium, a major product with the expected length and sequence for the ligated exons was generated. unlike, however, all members of group ii investigated so far, the excised intron was in linear, rather than in a branched (lariat), form.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
