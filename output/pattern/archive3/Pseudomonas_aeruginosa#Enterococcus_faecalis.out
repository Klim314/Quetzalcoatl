2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
in this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3h)-thiones, 2-r-(quinazolin-4(3h)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (ft-ir, lc-ms, 1h-nmr). antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, candida albicans and nci in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. the most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. the introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3h)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer uo-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia ccrf-cem. the results of in silico molecular docking for dhfr and ck2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.
antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
chemical assessment and antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of endophytic fungi extracts isolated from costus spiralis (jacq.) roscoe (costaceae).
costus spiralis (costaceae) is a species native to the amazon region and is used  in traditional medicine. the endophytic fungi used in this study were obtained from leaves of this plant. 13 strains were selected to obtain hydroethanolic extracts and were submitted to hydroalcoholic extraction and evaluated for antioxidant activity by dpph (2,2-difenil-1-picrilhidrazil) and frap (ferric reducing antioxidant power), and all of the fungi had positive results. the antimicrobial action of crude extracts had a good range of activities. all extracts had inhibitory activities against the yeasts of candida albicans and c. parapsilosis, with 125 to 500 mug/ml mic. eight extracts had antimicrobial activities against bacillus subtilis (mic from 62.4 to 125 mug/ml), 5 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic from 125 to 500 mug/ml), 2 against salmonella enterica (mic from 125 to 62.5 mug/ml), and 2 against enterococcus faecalis (mic from 500 to 125 mug/ml). the presence of secondary metabolites, including coumarins, was observed during chemical evaluation by thin layer chromatography. total phenol content was estimated, and a strong positive correlation to antioxidant activity was observed, according to its pearson coefficient. this is the first report of the bioactive potential of endophytic fungi isolated from the costaceae family in brazilian ecosystems.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of a. retroflexus.
in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 mul/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtills, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (candida albicans, c. famata, c. utilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic determination) for antimicrobial activity and teac (trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. the adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of a. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. the extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis with no activity against s. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against c. famata by both extracts. the a. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the p. aeruginosa clinical strain. the inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on b. subtilis strain. the antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
antimicrobial activity, toxicity and selectivity index of two biflavonoids and a  flavone isolated from podocarpus henkelii (podocarpaceae) leaves.
background: different parts of podocarpus henkelii have been used in many cultures around the world to treat ailments such as cholera, stomach diseases, rheumatism, cancer, canine distemper in dogs and gall sickness in cattle. the aim of this study was to evaluate the biological activity and toxicity of isolated compounds from podocarpus henkelii after an earlier study indicated a promising activity in crude extracts against viral pathogens of veterinary importance. methods: the antibacterial and antifungal activity of two biflavonoids 7, 4', 7", 4"'-tetramethoxy amentoflavone (tma), isoginkgetin (igg) and podocarpus flavone-a (pfa) isolated from the leaves of podocarpus henkelii were determined using a serial microplate dilution method with tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. the cytotoxicity of compounds tma and igg were determined on different cell types using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric cellular assay (mtt). the ames test was used to determine their mutagenic activities. results: tma had reasonable antifungal activity against aspergillus fumigatus (mic = 30 mug/ml). igg had a wide spectrum of activity against four bacterial and two fungal pathogens with much higher selectivity index values obtained for a. fumigatus and cryptococcus neoformans (si > 30). pfa had a broad spectrum of activity against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa (si > 15) and less activity against the two fungal pathogens. in both the cytotoxicity assays and ames mutagenicity test using salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100, tma and igg had no deleterious effect on the different cell types and did not induce mutations in the ames test. conclusion: although the antimicrobial activities of the isolated compounds were not that exciting, the compounds had no cytotoxic activity at the highest concentration (1000 mug/ml) tested against all three cell lines. igg was the most active against e. coli, s. aureus, a. fumigatus and c. neoformans, exhibiting both antibacterial and antifungal activity with good selectivity index values. pfa had a broad spectrum of activity against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. the two compounds isolated had low toxicity and no genotoxic activity in the ames test.
enzymatic elucidation of haemocyanin from kuruma shrimp marsupenaeus japonicus and its molecular recognition mechanism towards pathogens.
haemocyanin is an important non-specific immune protein present in the hemolymph  of invertebrates, which have the ability to recognize the microbial pathogens and trigger the innate immune system. in this study, we isolated and purified the haemocyanin using gel filtration chromatography and investigated its microbial recognition mechanism against the invading pathogens. kuruma shrimp marsupenaeus japonicus haemocyanin showed the single band with a molecular weight of 76 kda on sds-page and its molecular mass was analysed through the maldi. pathogen recognition mechanism of m. japonicus haemocyanin was detected through bacterial agglutination, agglutination inhibition and prophenoloxidase activity. m. japonicus haemocyanin agglutinate all human blood rbc types and showed the bacterial agglutination against all tested gram positive staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis and gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and vibrio parahaemolyticus at the concentrations ranging from 30 to 50 mug/ml. agglutination was inhibited by 50-200 mm of n-acetylneuraminic acid, a-d-glucose, d-galactose and d-xylose. our results suggest that, 76 kda subunit of m. japonicus haemocyanin recognize the pathogenic surface proteins which are present on the outer membrane of the bacteria and mediates the bacterial agglutination through haemocytes. this bacterial agglutination was visualized through confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). this present study would be helpful to explore the importance of haemocyanin in innate immune response of m. japonicus and its eliciting pathogen recognition mechanism leads to the development of innate immunity in crustaceans.
impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. these are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. we focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and thermal analysis (tga). the antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). all studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and particularly against staphylococcus aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of ca that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model organism can be excluded.
toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. at concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 mcfarland standard solution of e. coli and per 400 cfu of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis in k. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.
recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
background: bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. this study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. methods: recombinant lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees c. results: results revealed that lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/ml s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and e. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. at this concentration, lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) cfu/ml staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. conclusion: recombinant lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
vellozia flavicans mart. ex schult. hydroalcoholic extract inhibits the neuromuscular blockade induced by bothrops jararacussu venom.
background: snakebite is a significant public health issue in tropical countries. in brazil, some of the most common snake envenomations are from bothrops. bothrops bites trigger local and systemic effects including edema, pain, erythema, cyanosis, infections, and necrosis. vellozia flavicans is a plant from the brazilian "cerrado" (savanna) that is popularly used as an anti-inflammatory medicine. since inflammation develops quickly after bothrops bites, which can lead to infection, the aim of the present study was to observe possible anti-snake venom and antimicrobial activities of v. flavicans (vf). methods: the chromatographic profile of the main constituents from the vf leaf hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by thin-layer chromatography (tlc). the anti-snake venom activity was measured by vf's ability to neutralize the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bothrops jararacussu venom (bjssu) in a mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm model (pnd). after a 20 min incubation, preparations of pnd were added to tyrode's solution (control); vf (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml); 40 mug/ml bjssu; pre-incubation for 30 min with bjssu and 1 mg/ml vf; and a bjssu pretreated preparation (for 10 min) followed by 1 mg/ml vf. myographic recording was performed, and the contractile responses were recorded. the antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] and minimum bactericidal concentration [mbc]) was obtained for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, using gentamicin and vancomycin as positive controls. results: tlc analysis yielded several compounds from vf, such as flavonoids (quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid). bjssu completely blocked the contractile responses of pnd preparations, while vf preserved 97% (+/-10%) of the contractile responses when incubated with bjssu. in the pnd pretreated with bjssu, vf was able to inhibit the neuromuscular blockade progress. mic and mbc of vf ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus strains, while no antimicrobial activity was observed for e. coli and e. faecalis. conclusions: the hydroalcoholic extract from vf leaves was able to neutralize and decrease the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bjssu. however, it did not show significant antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria.
[investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food products].
preservatives are added to food, drugs and other pharmaceutical products to avoid microbial contamination. for antimicrobial activity testing and preservative efficacy testing, vegetative forms of the standard test organisms are used. however, microbial biofilm formation may occur on living tissues, medical implants, industrial or drinking water pipes, natural aquatic systems, glass and plastic surfaces. in our study, it was aimed to determine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drug, cosmetics and food products and to compare the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic) of microbial biofilm formed on glass surfaces which are commonly used in those areas and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of the planktonic forms. in the study pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, salmonella thyphimurium sl1344, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis nctc 11047, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as the standard strains; sodium nitrate, methylparaben, prophylparaben, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate as the preservatives; ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin b and itraconazole as the antimicrobial agents. mic values were determined through the guidelines of clsi m100-s18 and m27-a3 protocols. biotimer method was used to determine the mbic values. the value of "colony forming unit (cfu)/glass beads" was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10cfu. all experiments were done with four media at different ph values namely ph: 7, ph: 6.5, ph: 6 and ph: 5.5. according to the results of tests on planktonic forms of the microorganisms, sodium benzoate was determined to be the most effective preservative against all the microorganisms tested except s.aureus and e.faecalis. the most effective preservative against s.aureus and e.faecalis was prophylparaben. prophylparaben was also effective against s.epidermidis. however, in our study it was determined that preservatives were not effective against biofilm forms even if the inoculum was lower, equal to or higher than the inocula of the planktonic forms. the data obtained from this study indicated that preservatives used to prevent microbial contamination in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products, are not effective against biofilm forms of the microorganisms. this study is thought to be a guide for further studies to be held in the investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food industry.
gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7 mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.
antimicrobial activity of extracts from in vivo and in vitro propagated lamium album l. plants.
the antimicrobial activity of 18 different extracts from in vivo and in vitro grown l. album l. plants was evaluated against clinical bacteria and yeasts using the well diffusion method. all the used extracts demonstrated antibacterial activity, whereas only the water extracts from leaves (in vivo) possessed antifungal activity against candida albicans nbimcc 72 and candida glabrata nbimcc 8673 (14 and 20 mm diameter of inhibition zones and mic 10 mg/ml, respectively). the methanol and ethanol extracts obtained from the in vitro propagated plants had a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity than those from in vivo plants, while the opposite tendency was observed for the chloroform extracts. all tested flower extracts possessed antimicrobial activity. the chloroform extract from in vivo flowers demonstrated the highest activity against e. faecalis nbimcc 3915, s. aureus nbimcc 3703, p. hauseri nbimcc 1339 and p. aeruginosa nbimcc 3700 (22 mm, 13 mm, 11 mm, 23 mm zone diameter of inhibition and mic 0.313 mg/ml, respectively). the water extracts from leaves (both in vivo and in vitro) possessed higher antibacterial activity than extract from flowers. the obtained results showed that both in vivo and in vitro propagated l. album l. could be used as a source of antibacterial substances.
antimicrobial efficacy of mineral trioxide aggregate with and without silver nanoparticles.
introduction: most current root-end filling materials do not provide a perfect seal. thus, a microscopic space is likely to exist in the interface between walls of the root-end cavity and filling material, which allows microorganisms and their products to penetrate. in addition to good sealing ability and biocompatibility, root-end filling materials should ideally have some antimicrobial activity. therefore, this in vitro study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of angelus white mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and the mixture of mta with silver nanoparticles (1% weight; mta/sn). materials and methods: antimicrobial properties of mta and mta/sn were tested by agar diffusion technique against enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the microbial inhibition zones around the materials were measured by a caliper with 0.1-mm accuracy. student's t-test was used for comparison between the two groups in normal data distribution and man-whitney u test for non-normal distribution. results: student's t-test revealed that for e. faecalis, c. albicans, and p. aeruginosa, microbial inhibition zone of mta/sn was significantly greater than that of mta (p = 0.000). mann-whitney u test indicated no significant difference between the effect of mta and mta/sn on s. aureus (p > 0.05). conclusion: based on the results of this study, adding silver nanoparticles to mta improved its antimicrobial efficacy.
prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of canine urinary tract pathogens.
this study aims to describe the incidence and risk factors for positive urinary tract culture, the prevalence of urinary tract pathogens in single organism and mixed cultures and changes in their antimicrobial resistance over 10 years. a retrospective review of computer records detailing canine urine samples submitted between august 1999 and september 2009 for culture and sensitivity in a uk tertiary referral hospital is described. 17.5 per cent of 5923 samples (670 of 4530 dogs) were positive cultures. 85.3 per cent of cultures yielded a single isolate. the prevalence of bacterial species differed between mixed and single isolate cultures. entire and neutered female dogs were more likely to return positive cultures than male dogs (or=2.5 and 1.5, respectively). escherichia coli was most commonly isolated (53.9 per cent) and affected female dogs, older dogs and neutered dogs more. there was an increase in the antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a decrease in the effectiveness of enrofloxacin, cephalexin and oxytetracycline. the prevalence of urinary bacterial isolates is described for a large group of dogs. monitoring changes in antimicrobial efficacy and microbial resistance guides the empirical use of antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infection and helps formulate strategic plans to limit drug resistance.
antibacterial effects of curcumin: an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration study.
aim: to evaluate the antibacterial effect of curcumin with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) method in standard bacterial strains. methods: the in vitro antibacterial activity of curcumin was evaluated against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (atcc 29213), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (atcc 43300), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), bacillus subtilis (atcc 6633), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 700603) using the macrodilution broth susceptibility test method. after incubation in tubes, the antibacterial activity of curcumin was detected by a lack of turbidity, which indicated the inhibition of bacterial growth. the concentration in the tube with the highest dilution showing no turbidity was defined as the mic. results: the curcumin mic values were 175 microg/ml, 129 microg/ml, 219 microg/ml, 217 microg/ml, 163 microg/ml, 293 microg/ml and 216 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis, mssa, mrsa, e. coli, e. faecalis and k. pneumonia, respectively. conclusion: this study revealed antibacterial effects of curcumin against standard bacterial strains in high concentrations. animal experiments have demonstrated that curcumin applied at high doses has strong antibacterial activity. there is a need for further in vivo studies to shed light on antibacterial effects of curcumin with high concentrations.
microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
the present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. the product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). these molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). the structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria viz., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and three gram-negative bacteria viz., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against candida albicans, aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus, fusarium oxysporum, penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against dalton's ascitic lymphoma (dal) cell line. in general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. the coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (r = i-pr, r(1) = 6-cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against dalton's ascitic lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/ml.
antimicrobial activity of pleurocidin is retained in plc-2, a c-terminal 12-amino acid fragment.
an analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the c-terminus of plc, designated plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. mic tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that plc-2 has potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but not against enterococcus faecalis. the antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as fusarium oxysporum, colletotrichum sp., aspergillus niger and alternaria sp., also identified plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. together, these results identify plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. in addition, it demonstrated that the khvgkaalthyl residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.

in an attempt to design and synthesize a new class of antimicrobials, dialkyne substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole was reacted with various substituted aryl azides to generate a small library of 20 compounds (3a-t) by click chemistry. structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectral data. these compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram+ bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), gram- bacteria (salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella boydii) and antifungal activity against candida tropicalis, candida albicans, candida krusei, cryptococcus neoformans) as well as molds (aspergillus niger, aspergillus fumigatus). the compound 3e showed maximum potency against all gram+/gram- bacterial strains with mic value 3.12 mug/ml, which is two fold more active as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin (mic 6.25 mug/ml). however, all compounds were found ineffective against s. boydii (clinical isolate). further, only one compound 3n was found to be the most active against all fungal strains with mic value in the range of 1.56 mug/ml-12.5 mug/ml while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antifungal activity.
biological approach to synthesize tio2 nanoparticles using aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. a novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (tio2 nps) was reported. the resulting nanoparticles were characterized by ftir, xrd, afm and fesem with edx. ftir showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group oh stretching amine nh stretch in the formation of tio2 nps. the xrd spectrum confirmed that the synthesized tio2 nps were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. the crystallite sizes were calculated using scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. the morphological characterization was analyzed by fesem and the analysis showed the nps smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. gc-ms analysis showed the main compounds found in a. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-l-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-l-proline (74.41%) and l-leucyl-d-leucine (15.74%). the potential glycyl-l-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. a possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of tio2 nps has been proposed. the antibacterial activity of the synthesized tio2 nps was assessed by well diffusion method toward a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against s. aureus (33 mm) and s. pyogenes (31 mm).
using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
comparison of rosco neo-sensitabs with oxoid paper disks in eucast disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on mueller-hinton agar.
this study compared neo-sensitabs with oxoid paper disks using the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test on mueller-hinton agar. the eucast-recommended quality control strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) (part i) and clinical isolates (part ii) were investigated. in part i of the study, 27 combinations of antimicrobial agents were tested on four quality control strains repeatedly up to 60 times and zone diameters of tablets and disks were compared. in part ii of the study, 351 clinical isolates were included to cover a broad range of species, as well as resistance mechanisms. in part i, four major deviations (>1 mm outside quality control ranges) were observed with neo-sensitabs. in one case with p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 (meropenem), there was a corresponding major deviation (2 mm) with the oxoid disk. the three remaining major deviations with neo-sensitabs were observed with meropenem (2 mm) in e. coli atcc 25922 and with ciprofloxacin (2 mm) and gentamicin (3 mm) in p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. for oxoid disks, there were only minor deviations (=1 mm outside quality control ranges) in these three cases. in part ii, there were six discrepancies, susceptible versus resistant, in 3,533 comparisons between the two methods with the clinical isolates. the rosco neo-sensitabs appear to be a possible alternative to oxoid paper disks for eucast disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on mueller-hinton agar.

antibacterial activity of the venom of heterometrus xanthopus.
heterometrus xanthopus (scorpion) is one of the most venomous and ancient arthropods. its venom contains anti-microbial peptides like hadrurin, scorpine, pandinin 1, and pandinin 2 that are able to effectively kill multidrug-resistant pathogens. the present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of h. xanthopus venom. six gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains were tested against 1/100, 1/10, and 1/1 fractions of distilled water diluted and crude venom. 1/100 and 1/10 dilutions were not successful in any of the six bacterial strains studied while the 1/1 dilution was effective on bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 with highest zone of inhibition were obtained on b. subtilis. crude venom was effective against enterococcus faecalis atcc 14506, b. subtilis, s. typhimurium, and p. aeruginosa. the most effective results were observed on b. subtilis.
antibiotic producing microorganisms from river wiwi, lake bosomtwe and the gulf of guinea at doakor sea beach, ghana.
background: microorganisms have provided a wealth of metabolites with interesting activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer. in this study, a total of 119 aquatic microbial isolates from 30 samples (taken from water bodies in ghana) were screened by the agar-well diffusion method for ability to produce antibacterial-metabolites. results: antibacterial activity was exhibited by 27 of the isolates (14 bacteria, 9 actinomycetes and 4 fungi) against at least one of the indicator microorganisms: enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), bacillus thuringiensis (atcc 13838), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), proteus vulgaris (nctc 4635) and bacillus subtilis (nctc 10073). a sea isolate mai2 (identified as a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa) exhibited the highest antibacterial activity (lowest zone of inhibition = 22 mm). the metabolites of mai2 extracted with chloroform were stable to heat and gave minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging between 250 and 2000 mug/ml. bioautography of the extract revealed seven active components. conclusion: this study has therefore uncovered the potential of water bodies in the west african sub-region as reservoirs of potent bioactive metabolite producing microorganisms.
the antimicrobial activity of the appetite peptide hormone ghrelin.
the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of the peptide ghrelin. both major forms of ghrelin, acylated ghrelin (ag) and desacylated ghrelin (dag), demonstrated the same degree of bactericidal activity against gram-negative escherichia coli (e. coli) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), while bactericidal effects against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were minimal or absent, respectively. to elucidate the bactericidal mechanism of ag and dag against bacteria, we monitored the effect of the cationic peptides on the zeta potential of e. coli. our results show that ag and dag similarly quenched the negative surface charge of e. coli, suggesting that ghrelin-mediated bactericidal effects are influenced by charge-dependent binding and not by acyl modification. like most cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps), we also found that the antibacterial activity of ag was attenuated in physiological nacl concentration (150mm). nonetheless, these findings indicate that both ag and dag can act as camps against gram-negative bacteria.
profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of andhra pradesh, india.
introduction: antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. methods: data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, through the use of questionnaires. the data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. results: the consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. these drugs were found to be in high demand. among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: escherichia coli (36%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), staphylococcus aureus (29%), enterococcus faecalis (9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). in terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. conclusion: the results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.
antibacterial activity of some african medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
context: plants are known to play a crucial role in african traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. objectives: to investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in african countries, providing scientific validation for their use. materials and methods: eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) and mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. results and discussion: in vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. the highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of acacia karroo hayne (fabaceae) and anacardium occidentale l. (anacardiaceae) and the roots of bridelia cathartica g. bertol (euphorbiaceae), against s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 7.5 microg/ml). the same mic values were exhibited against e. faecalis by the methanol extract of a. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of b. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of momordica balsamina l. (curcubitaceae) leaves. gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive; the growth of p. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (mic = 31 microg/ml) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of gomphocarpus fruticosus (l.) ait. (asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of trichilia emetica vahl (meliaceae) seeds. most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. conclusion: this study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. some of them are worthy of further investigation.
evaluation of wound healing and antimicrobial potentials of ixora coccinea root extract.
objective: to evaluate the wound healing and antimicrobial activity of root extracts of ixora coccinea (i. coccinea). methods: to investigate the wound healing efficacy of root extract of i. coccinea linn, five groups of animals were divided each containing six animals. two wound models including incision and excision wound models were used in this study. the parameters studied were tensile strength on incision wound model and in terms of wound contraction for excision wound model were compared with standard nitrofurazone (nfz) ointment (0.2% w/w). six extracts (ethanol, aqueous, petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform and ethyl acetate) of i. coccinea were screened for in vitro growth inhibiting activity against different bacterial strains viz, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus pumilius, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi candida albicans and aspergillus niger were compared with the standard drugs ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol for antibacterial and griseofulvin for antifungal screening. the serial dilution and cup (or) well plate methods were used for the antimicrobial study and mic was determined. results: the ethanolic extract showed significant (p<0.001) wound healing activity when compared to standard drug nfz with respect to normal control group. amongst all, ethanolic extract showed highly significant antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains used in this study when compared to standard. the aqueous extract showed moderate significant inhibition against all bacterial strains when compared to standard. all the extracts were shown negligible activity against the fungal strains used in this study. conclusions: the ethanolic root extract of i. coccinea showed pronounced wound healing and antibacterial activity. the probable reason to heal the wound was that the external application of the extract prevented the microbes to invade through the wound thus the protection of wound occurs against the infection of the various organisms.
enhanced antibacterial activity of bimetallic gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles at low silver concentration.
herein we report the development of bimetallic au@ag core-shell nanoparticles (nps) where gold nanoparticles (au nps) served as the seeds for continuous deposition of silver atoms on its surface. the core-shell structure and morphology were examined by uv-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (tem), energy dispersive x-ray (edx) analysis and x-ray diffraction (xrd). the core-shell nps showed antibacterial activity against both gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (enterococcus faecalis and pediococcus acidilactici) bacteria at low concentration of silver present in the shell, with more efficacy against gram negative bacteria. tem and flow cytometric studies showed that the core-shell nps attached to the bacterial surface and caused membrane damage leading to cell death. the enhanced antibacterial properties of au@ag core-shell nps was possibly due to the more active silver atoms in the shell surrounding gold core due to high surface free energy of the surface ag atoms owing to shell thinness in the bimetallic np structure.
dna, protein binding, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and antibacterial activities  of new palladium(ii) complexes of thiosemicarbazone ligands: effects of substitution on biological activity.
the coordination propensities of 4(n,n')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(n)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (h(2)l(1-4)) were investigated by reacting with an equimolar amount of [pdcl(2)(pph(3))(2)]. the new complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. the structure determination of the complexes [pd(deasal-tsc)(pph(3))] (1), [pd(deasal-mtsc)(pph(3))] (2) and [pd(deasal-etsc)(pph(3))] (3) by x-ray crystallography showed that ligands are coordinated in a dibasic tridentate ons donor fashion forming stable five and six membered chelate rings. the binding ability of complexes (1-4) to calf-thymus dna (ct dna) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. based on the observations, an electrostatic and an intercalative binding mode have been proposed. the protein binding studies have been monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as a model protein. as determined by mtt assays, complex 3 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect towards human lung cancer cell line (a549) and liver cancer cells (hepg2). ldh, no assay and cellular uptake of the complexes have been studied. further, antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against the pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, mic50 values of the complexes showed that the complexes exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among the complexes, 3 exhibited higher activity.
wfdc2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
wap four disulfide core domain 2 (wfdc2) is a four disulfide core (4-dsc) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. it is comprised of two 4-dsc domains assigned domain iii at the nh2-terminal end and domain ii at the cooh-terminal end. the wfdc2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. the wfdc2 protein showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain ii. there was no antibacterial activity detected against enterococcus faecalis. the observed expression pattern of tammar wfdc2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by s. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. the latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as e. faecalis.
application of baranyi function to model the antibacterial properties of solvent  extract from irish york cabbage against food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
cabbage is a rich source of a number of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, glucosinolates and their breakdown products which may have antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer properties. outer green leaves of york cabbage were extracted with 60% methanol, ethanol or acetone. antibacterial activities of vacuum dried crude extracts were estimated against a number of gram-positive and gram-negative food spoilage and food pathogenic bacteria. the crude extracts showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities but 60% methanol extract exhibited the highest antibacterial effect. complete growth inhibition for listeria monocytogenes was achieved with an extract concentration of 1.4%, whereas a two-fold concentration was required to achieve a reduction of 75% and 64% for salmonella abony and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. for enterococcus faecalis methanolic extract showed a weak inhibition only (31%). the lower concentrations of methanolic extract from york cabbage prolonged the lag phase and reduced both the exponential growth rate and final population densities of the culture. survival of the micro-organisms in presence of methanolic extract was mathematically modeled using baranyi model equations.
chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of lantana camara var. moritziana.
the essential oil obtained from the leaves of lantana camara var. moritziana (otto & dietr.) lopez-palacios collected at rubio, tachira state, venezuela, was obtained by hydrodistillation in a clevenger trap (0.1% yield). the oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc/ms) on hp gc-ms system, model 5973, identifying 33 compounds (97.1%) of which the major components were germacrene d (31.0%), followed by beta-caryophyllene (14.8%), a-phellandrene (6.7%), limonene (5.7%) and 1,8-cineole (5.2%). evaluation of the antibacterial activity by agar diffusion method with discs against international reference bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed growing inhibition of e. faecalis and s. aureus at mic of 350 mg/ml and 400 mg/ml, respectively.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
objective: some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. materials and methods: antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against dna virus herpes simplex type 1 and rna virus parainfluenza (type-3). cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using madin-darby bovine kidney and vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: candida albicans and candida parapsilosis. results: atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. conclusion: antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
triterpenoid saponins from symplocos lancifolia.
three new bidesmosidic saponins (1-3) and a new ursane triterpenoid, 2alpha,3beta,11alpha,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (4), along with seven known compounds, were isolated from a methanolic extract of the leaves of symplocos lancifolia. the bidesmosidic saponins were found to possess the same sugar unit part, composed of two beta-d-glucose moieties and one alpha-l-rhamnose moiety, linked to maslinic acid, arjunolic acid, and asiatic acid, respectively. their structures were elucidated by interpretation of their 1d and 2d nmr spectra and completed by analysis of the hresims data. the antibacterial activity of the isolated triterpenoids was evaluated against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and several showed activity against gram-positive bacteria.
[evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of vale do sousa and tamega].
the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
transition metal complexes of the type [m(l)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [m(l)(2)(pph(3))] {m=ni, co, cu and zn; l=cyclohexylamine-n-dithiocarbamate; pph(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. the complexes were characterized using ir, uv-vis, nmr spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (tga). the (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and (31)p nmr showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. the spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. the ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against aspergillus flavus, aspergillus carbonarius, aspergillus niger and aspergillus fumigatus. the metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with zn(l)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/ml; and ni(l)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/ml under laboratory conditions.
antibacterial activity of medicinal plants against pathogens causing complicated  urinary tract infections.
seventeen indian folklore medicinal plants were investigated to evaluate antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanol and acetone extracts against 66 multidrug resistant isolates of major urinary tract pathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis) by disc diffusion method. ethanol extract of zingiber officinale and punica granatum showed strong antibacterial activity against escherichia coli. ethanol extracts of terminalia chebula and ocimum sanctum exhibited antibacterial activity against klebsiella pneumoniae. ethanol extract of cinnamomum cassia showed maximum antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa while ethanol extract of azadirachta indica and ocimum sanctum exhibited antibacterial activity against enterococcus faecalis. the results support the folkloric use of these plants in the treatment of urinary tract infections by the tribals of mahakoshal region of central india.
essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
effects of biofilm treatments on the multi-species lubbock chronic wound biofilm  model.
objective: to evaluate the efficacy of several biofilm effectors in inhibiting biofilm formation in an in vitro multi-species chronic wound biofilm model. method: the lubbock chronic wound biofilm (lcwb) model has been described in detail elsewhere. pathogens used in the model are pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. these are three of the most important species associated with biofilms. here, the model was exposed to the following biofilm effectors: xylitol, salicylic acid, farnesol, erythritol and two proprietary, semi-solid, wound-dressing formulations currently under development (sanguitec gels). results: biofilm formation was completely inhibited in the lcwb model following treatment with 20% xylitol, 10% erythritol, 1,000 microg/ml farnesol, 20mm salicylic acid or 0.1% of either of the two sanguitec gel formulations. salicylic acid specifically inhibited s. aureus (p<0.01) at 10mm and 20mm, consequently increasing the ratios of p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis within the biofilm. xylitol had an increasing inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa (p<0.01) at all concentrations evaluated. erythritol had an inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa and s. aureus growth (p<0.01) at over 5% concentrations. the inhibitory effect of both sanguitec gel formulations was more broadly effective, with an increasingly inhibitory effect on all lcwb species (p<0.01). conclusion: the lcwb model provides a multi-species format with which to evaluate the effect of biofilm effectors on wound flora in a biofilm phenotype. these results suggest that different treatments can target specific populations within a biofilm. salicylic acid preferentially targeted s. aureus, xylitol preferentially targeted p. aeruginosa, while erythritol preferentially targeted both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. in contrast, the two sanguitec gel formulations provided a broad, less preferential, inhibition of biofilm development. declaration of interest: research and testing laboratory is a for-profit enterprise that develops molecular methods and performs service research work on biofilms. sanguitec gel was developed by jpk and cej.

background: we determined the in vitro activity of 9 synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids (+/-)-solenopsin a, (2r, 6r)-solenopsin a, (2s, 6s)-solenopsin b, (+/-)-isosolenopsin a, (2s, 6r)-isosolenopsin a,(2r, 6s)-isosolenopsin a, (+/-)-isosolenopsin b, (2s, 6r)-isosolenopsin b, and (2r, 6s)-isosolenopsin b against 6 species of bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bacteriocidal concentration were determined in accordance with the clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines. time kill studies used american type culture collection bacterial isolates tested at 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentration. results: none of the venom alkaloids inhibited e. coli or p. aeruginosa, whereas all the alkaloids inhibited s. pneumoniae. only 4 alkaloids inhibited s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and s. maltophilia. time-kill kinetics indicates that all 4 active alkaloids had bactericidal activity. conclusions: specific isomers of synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids have antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
[antimicrobial activity of tebipenem against various clinical isolates from various specimen, mainly urinary tract].
tebipenem is the active metabolite of me1211, tebipenem pivoxil, a novel oral carbapenem that possesses potent activity against almost pathogens except for pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study, we compared the susceptibility of tebipenem with current antibiotics against various organisms isolated from various specimen, mainly urinary tract. tebipenem had a potent activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae; its activity was comparable to it of cefixime that has most potent activity among oral antibiotics. against enterococcus faecalis, the activity of tebipenem was comparable to the activities of ampicillin and amoxicillin, and superior to it of faropenem. against citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter spp. including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, tebipenem had a potent activity with or without ceftazidime-resistance.
antiplasmid activity of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate from alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
ethnopharmacological relevance: alpinia galanga (l.) swartz is traditionally used in the treatment of various ailments across india, china, and southeast asian countries. in india it is a reputed drug in indigenous system of medicine and largely used as antibacterial and antiseptic. in southern india the rhizomes has been used as a domestic remedy against bacterial infections. aim of the study: to identify a potential antiplasmid compound from alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria. materials and methods: the crude rhizome extract of alpinia galanga was prepared in acetone. antibacterial activity was checked by mic and antiplasmid activity was checked by sic. the principal compound responsible for the antiplasmid activity, in the crude extract, was identified by bioassay guided fractionation using hexane-acetone. antibiotic resistance profile of plasmid harboring strains and plasmid cured strains was determined by disc diffusion method. results: the crude acetone extract of the rhizomes of alpinia galanga exhibited antiplasmid activity against salmonella typhi, escherichia coli and vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis with an efficiency of 92%, 82% and 8% respectively at 400 microg/ml sic. the principal compound responsible for the activity was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate. 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrated the ability to cure plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance in various multi-drug resistant bacterial strains of clinical isolates such as enterococcus faecalis, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and bacillus cereus with curing efficiency of 66%, 75%, 70%, 32% and 6% respectively at sic of 400-800 microg/ml. conclusion: 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate mediated r-plasmid curing significantly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit growth of bacteria, thus making the antibiotic treatment more effective.
leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers based on calcium hydroxide and mta.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new root canal sealer containing calcium hydroxide (acroseal) and the root canal sealer based on mta (endo cpm sealer), in comparison with traditional sealers (sealapex, sealer 26 and intrafill) and white mta-angelus, against five different microorganism strains. the materials and their components were evaluated after manipulation, employing the agar diffusion method. a base layer was made using muller-hinton agar (mh) and wells were made by removing agar. the materials were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), candida albicans (atcc 10231), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 10541). the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the results showed that sealapex and its base paste, sealer 26 and its powder, endo cpm sealer and its powder, white mta and its powder all presented antimicrobial activity against all strains. intrafill and its liquid presented antimicrobial activity against all strains except p. aeruginosa and acroseal was effective only against m. luteus and s. aureus.
antibacterial activity of epidural infusions.
the incidence of epidural abscess following epidural catheterisation appears to be increasing, being recently reported as one in 1000 among surgical patients. this study was designed to investigate the antibacterial activity of various local anaesthetics and additives, used in epidural infusions, against a range of micro-organisms associated with epidural abscess. the aim was to determine which, if any, epidural infusion solution has the greatest antibacterial activity. bupivacaine, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine crystals were dissolved and added to mueller-hinton agar in concentrations of 0.06%, 0.125%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1%. fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine were also mixed with agar in isolation and in combination with the local anaesthetics. using a reference agar dilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for a range of bacteria. bupivacaine showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli with minimum inhibitory concentrations between 0.125% and 0.25%. it did not inhibit the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa at any of the concentrations tested. levobupivacaine and ropivacaine showed no activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, even at the highest concentrations tested, and minimal activity against escherichia coli (minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.5% and 1% respectively). the presence of fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine had no additional effect on the antibacterial activity of any of the local anaesthetic agents. the low concentrations of local anaesthetic usually used in epidural infusions have minimal antibacterial activity. while the clinical implications of this in vitro study are not known, consideration should be given to increasing the concentration of bupivacaine in an epidural infusion or to administering a daily bolus of 0.25% bupivacaine to reduce the risk of epidural bacterial growth.
hylin a1, the first cytolytic peptide isolated from the arboreal south american frog hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog").
rp-hplc fractionation of the electrically stimulated skin secretion of the arboreal south american frog hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog") led to the isolation of a cytolytic c-terminally amidated peptide. this novel peptide, named hylin a1 (hy-a1), consists of 18 amino acid residues (ifgailplalgalknlik-nh(2)). the alpha-helical structure of the synthetic hylin a1 peptide was confirmed by cd spectroscopy in the presence of 60% (v/v) tfe. the synthetic peptide displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa and also against fungi (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. parapsilosis and cryptococcus neoformans). hylin a1 was also able to disrupt human erytrocytes (hc(50)=18 microm). similarity analysis using psi-blast revealed 50-44% of identity to maximins hv, h16, h15 and h10 from bombina maxima and also to hylins b1 and b2 (hy-b1 and hy-b2) from hypsiboas lundii (synonym: hyla biobeba).
microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
lipids including cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate contribute to the inherent antibacterial activity of human nasal fluid.
mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. the antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal defense have not been defined. we found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein a-i. the predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide hnp-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against p. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. these data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. the emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.
antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of salvia chloroleuca.
the aerial parts of salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  shahrestanak (tehran province of iran). the essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of s. chloroleuca was studied against seven gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and mic values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
antibacterial activity of honey from stingless honeybees (hymenoptera; apidae; meliponinae).
the aim of the study was to examine antibacterial activity of the honey of stingless honeybees (meliponinae). an agar well diffusion assay demonstrated that many honey samples of stingless honeybees inhibited the growth of test strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa; moreover, they exhibited non-peroxide antibacterial activity against those strains. this is the first time that non-peroxide antimicrobial activity of honey from a number of species of stingless honeybees has been demonstrated. these antibacterial activities appear to be powerful, even when compared to those of"manuka honey" from apinae honeybees.
in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
antimicrobial activity of some salvia species essential oils from iran.
the aerial parts of salvia multicaulis, s. sclarea and s. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. the essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus pumulis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae and aspergillus niger). the results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and mic values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for p. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. in contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of s. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, c. albicans and s. cerevisiae.
diversity of bacterial isolates from commercial and homemade composts.
the diversity of heterotrophic bacterial isolates of three commercial and two homemade composts was studied. the commercial composts were produced from poultry litter (pc), sewage sludge (sc), municipal solid waste (mc), and homemade composts (thermal compost [dc] and vermicompost [vc]) from food wastes. the taxonomic and physiological diversity of the heterotrophic culturable bacteria was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic characterization and the analysis of the partial 16s rrna gene sequence. composts dc and sc presented the higher genotypic diversity, as could be inferred from the number of distinct genotypic patterns observed, 28 and 21, respectively. gram-positive bacteria, mainly firmicutes, were predominant in all the composts. some organisms related with taxa rarely reported in composts, as rhodanobacter spathiphylli, moraxella osloensis, lysobacter, corynebacterium, pigmentiphaga kullae, and new taxa were also isolated. the highest relative proportion of isolates able to degrade starch was found in compost sc (> 70%), to degrade gelatine in compost dc (> 70%), to degrade tween 80 in compost pc (> 90%), and to degrade poly-epsilon-caprolactones in compost dc (> 80%). compost mc presented the lowest relative proportions of isolates able to degrade starch (< 25%), gelatine (< 20%), and poly-epsilon-caprolactone (< 40%). when compared with the others, the homemade composts presented higher relative proportions of gram-positive isolates able to inhibit the target organisms staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. in compost mc, none of the gram-positive isolates was able to inhibit those targets.
[species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated raisus using an early-harvested cell suspension].
we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests. with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.
antimicrobial activity of seven hypericum entities from central italy.
methanol-acetone extracts from aerial parts of seven entities of the genus hypericum [h. perforatum l. subsp. perforatum, h. perforatum l. subsp. veronense (schrank) ces., h. montanum l., h. hyssopifolium chaix, h. hirsutum l., h. hircinum l. subsp. majus (aiton) n. robson, h. tetrapterum fr.] growing in the appennino umbro-marchigiano (central italy) were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), two gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the yeast candida albicans, by the kirby-bauer agar diffusion method. the two h. perforatum subspecies were particularly active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, supporting the use of these plants in the traditional medicine of central italy to treat wounds, skin and infectious diseases. however significant values of inhibition were given also by h. hirsutum against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, and by h. hyssopifolium, h. hircinum subsp. majus and h. tetrapterum against c. albicans. these results suggest that hypericin and hyperforin are the main components responsible for antimicrobial activity, but not the only ones, as other extracts, showing a low level of these compounds, possess evident activity. isolation of pure compounds from the most active extracts is in progress.
antimicrobial activities of some tetrahydronaphthalene-benzimidazole derivatives.
novel retinoid derivatives containing a benzimidazole moiety were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity. their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, candida krusei and candida albicans were evaluated. while some of the compounds exhibited moderate activity against mrsa, s. aureus, e. faecalis, c. krusei and c. albicans, none of the compounds showed activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata.
extracts from the leaves of bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (seaman's schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. all extracts were lyophilized. these extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella paratyphi, citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus atcc 25213, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (candida albicans). agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. all the organisms except candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. the squeezed-leaf juice of kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with mic of 8 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain staphylococcus aureus while its mbc is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of bryophyllum pinnatum. extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.
antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of salvia sclarea l.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant staphylococci.
the antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. the growth of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis) but not gram-negative ones (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. this was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. the highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. it limited the survival of biofilms formed by s. aureus as well as by s. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.
in vitro activities of three carbapenems against recent bacterial isolates from severely ill patients at swedish hospitals.
to study the in vitro activity of imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem against common pathogens isolated from patients in intensive care, haematology and dialysis/nephrology units at 7 swedish university hospitals, a total of 788 isolates were collected during 2002-2003. the distribution of the isolates was as follows: escherichia coli (n = 140), klebsiella spp. (n = 132), proteus spp. (n = 97), enterobacter spp. (n = 113), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 126), acinetobacter spp. (n = 53) and enterococcus faecalis (n = 127). the susceptibility to the 3 carbapenems was determined by e-test, and the mics were interpreted according to srga criteria. all 3 carbapenems were highly active against enterobacteriaceae. the overall susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem was 90%, 98% and 93%, respectively. against enterobacteriaceae, enterobacter spp. excluded, ertapenem had an equal or lower mic(90) than meropenem. apart from being the most active carbapenem against enterobacteriaceae, meropenem was also the most active carbapenem against p. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem was the most active drug against acinetobacter spp. the carbapenems are still potent antibiotics. with the introduction of ertapenem, and an expected increase in the carbapenem consumption due to an increased prevalence of strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, continuous surveillance of carbapenem resistance appears to be warranted, with special attention to p. aeruginosa, enterobacter and proteus spp.
antibacterial activity of crude methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial parts of anthemis tinctoria.
the antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial  parts of aniheinis tinctoria (asteraceae) was investigated against representative gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) and gram-negative strains escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853). the activity was concentrated mainly in the dichloromethane (dcm) and hexane fractions of crude methanolic extract. the 5 mg of dcm extract per disk produced 15-16 mm of inhibition zone against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, however, no activity was found against e. faecalis and e. coli. the hexane fraction showed activity against s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis. as dcm fraction showed the highest antibacterial activity in the disk diffusion assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values of only this fraction was determined against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. these values were found to be in the range of 1.25 to 10 mg/ml.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2004 and july 2005. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. the strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). against staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (abk), vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc) and vcm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (czop) and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or = 4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, czop, meropenem (mepm), and carumonam (crmn) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. against serratia marcescens, imipenem (ipm) and gentamicin (gm) had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. mepm prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/ml. next, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), czop, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/ml except ipm and mepm having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activities of czop and caz were considered to be relatively good on mic50 comparison (mic50: 2 microg/ml).
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). ii. background of patients].
seven hundred and nineteen bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2002 and july 2003. the frequency of bacteria isolation divided with patient clinical background was compared. the clinical background investigated included sex, age, type of infections, timing of antibiotics administration, and presence or absence of surgery affecting a decrease in defense against infection. the bacterial strains were divided with the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. in males, the number of patients aged less than 50 years was few and the complicated utis without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. number of patients aged 20-39 years was greater in female than male. in all of ages except 0-9 and 70-79 years, the ratio of the uncomplicated utis was high, accounting for 44.4-91.7% of all types of infections. in the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis also were relatively frequently isolated. e. coli was most frequently isolated from the uncomplicated utis, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated from the complicated utis with indwelling catheter. with respect to the relation of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated utis, the isolation frequency of e. coli was the highest in all age groups, accounting for 40% or higher. in the complicated utis without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli decreased with aging of the patients but still was the highest in all age groups. in the complicated utis with indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli was lower than in the uncomplicated utis in all age groups and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis between before and after the administration of antibiotics, p. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any types of utis. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis with or without surgery, e. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in any utis.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2003 and july 2004. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. the strains consisted of 258 gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (abpc), cefozopran (czop), imipenem (ipm), and clarithromycin (cam) showed a strong activity and the mic90 was 0.125 microg/ml or less. against enterococcus faecalis, vcm, abpc, and ipm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially czop and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or =4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (mepm) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of crmn and czop was good. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. against serratia marcescens, mepm had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, mepm and crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. nest, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cpr, czop, and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/ml except ipm and amikacin (amk) having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was relatively good (mic50: 2 microg/ml).
comparison of workflow and accuracy of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci by vitek 2 and routine methods.
three hundred and fifty-three consecutive urine cultures growing enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci were subjected to parallel identification (id) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) by vitek 2 and routine methods, including simple screening tests or api 20 e for id and standardized disc diffusion for ast. accuracy of results, technician hands-on time required by both methods and time to results were compared. vitek 2 correctly identified 322 (94.7%) of the 340 gram-negative isolates and 17 (81%) of the 21 enterococcus faecalis strains. ast by vitek 2 and disc diffusion gave category agreement for 4,058 (95.5%) of 4,248 organism-antimicrobial agent combinations. with mic determination by e-test as reference, ast by vitek 2 and disc diffusion produced 15 and 3 very major errors, respectively. six (40%) of the fifteen very major errors by vitek 2 were associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. with an average of 22 specimens processed per day, use of vitek 2 saved 80 min per day of technician hands-on time as compared to routine methods. regarding the cost of hands-on worktime and consumables, use of vitek 2 for identification of escherichia coli-screened enterobacteriaceae saved 0.70 p per sample in comparison to api 20 e. more than 80% of enterobacteriaceae introduced to vitek 2 in the morning could be reported by 16:00.
purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
bovine lactoperoxidase (lpo) was purified with amberlite cg 50 h+ resin, cm sephadex c-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex g-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. the activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (abts) as a choromogenic substrate at ph 6.0. purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with sds-page and rz value (a412/a280). rz value for the purified lpo was 0.8. km value at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c for the lpo was 0.20 mm. vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c. bovine lpo showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila atcc 7966, micrococcus luteus la 2971, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, bacillus subtilis img 22, pseudomonas pyocyanea, bacillus subtilis var. niger atcc 10, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 15753, bacillus brevis fmc3, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 5, corynebacterium xerosis uc 9165, bacillus cereus eu, bacillus megaterium nrs, yersinia enterocolytica, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, bacillus megaterium eu, bacillus megaterium dsm32, klebsiella oxytocica, staphylococcus aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, mycobacterium smegmatis ccm 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. the lpo--100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to department of dermatology,  poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. the percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the european population is about 1%-2%. the aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. in 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and escherichia coli (12.57%). there was a significant increase in the incidence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. the rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
domain 5 of high molecular weight kininogen is antibacterial.
antimicrobial peptides are important effectors of the innate immune system. these peptides belong to a multifunctional group of molecules that apart from their antibacterial activities also interact with mammalian cells and glycosaminoglycans and control chemotaxis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. here we demonstrate a novel antimicrobial activity of the heparin-binding and cell-binding domain 5 of high molecular weight kininogen. antimicrobial epitopes of domain 5 were characterized by analysis of overlapping peptides. a peptide, hkh20 (his(479)-his(498)), efficiently killed the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy demonstrated that hkh20 binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. furthermore, no discernible hemolysis or membrane-permeabilizing effects on eukaryotic cells were noted. proteolytic degradation of high molecular weight kininogen by neutrophil-derived proteases as well as the metalloproteinase elastase from p. aeruginosa yielded fragments comprising hkh20 epitopes, indicating that kininogen-derived antibacterial peptides are released during proteolysis.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after 16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
[resistance of urinary tract infection pathogens and choice of antibacterial therapy in pediatric urologic practice].
the data on antibiotic resistance of the main uropathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infection in an urologic department (319 isolates) and outpatient and diagnostic units (360 isolates) are presented. it was shown that by the antibiotic resistance the escherichia coli isolates from the urologic department patients and outpatients did not practically differ: 44.1 and 47.8% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 26.7 and 23.4% were resistant to amoxycillin/clavulanate, 28.9 and 24.9% were resistant to co-trimoxazole and 26.5% was resistance to cefuroxime (outpatients). the basic differences referred to pseudomonas aeruginosa: resistance to ceftazidime in 38.5% of the isolates and resistance to gentamicin in 36.2% of the isolates. the activity against p. aeruginosa could be arranged as follows in the decreasing order: amikacin = meropenem > imipenem > cefepime = cefoperazone/sulbactam > gentamicin = ceftazidime. resistance of p. aeruginosa to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) remained low (7.4 and 8.0% respectively). no ampicillin resistance was revealed in the isolates of enterococcus faecalis.
[antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance of recent isolates from ophthalmological infections to gatifloxacin and other antimicrobial drugs].
the antimicrobial susceptibility of 240 isolates from the ophthalmological infections during july 2003 to march 2004 was determined to gatifloxacin (gflx), levofloxacin, lomefloxacin and cefmenoxime applicable for ophthalmological infections. the in vitro activities of these drugs against the fresh isolates were compared. the quinolones including gflx were potently active against gram-positive bacteria, except for mrsa, a major causative pathogens for ophthalmological infection. when mic ranges, mic50 and mic90 of three quinolones were compared, it was considered that the activity of gflx was the most active of them. gflx showed to be more active against opportunistic pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa than other antimicrobial agents, and gflx was especially potent against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. in conclusion, gflx exhibits a potently active against fresh isolates from ophthalmological infections, and has an effective potential in the treatment of ophthalmological infections with the drug to administer eye drops.
survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than 200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). ii. background of patients].
a total of 615 bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 13 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2002 and july 2003. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. the bacterial strains were divided by the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. in males, the number of patients aged less than 50 years was few and the complicated utis without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. in the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were escherichia coli. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis were also relatively frequently isolated. e. coli decreased and p. aeruginosa increased with the complication of the infections. e. faecalis tended to be isolated more frequently in the complicated utis than in the uncomplicated utis. with respect to the relation of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated utis, the isolation frequency of e. coli was the highest in all age groups, accounting for 70.8% in 20-49 years old. in the complicated utis without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli decreased with aging of the patients and was lower than that of e. faecalis in the patients aged 70 or more (18.3 vs 20.6%). in the complicated utis with indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli was lower than in the uncomplicated utis in all age groups and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis between before and after the administration of antibiotics, e. coli decreased and p. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any utis. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis with or without surgery, e. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while p. aeruginosa was more in the patients with surgery in any utis. e. faecalis was more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in uncomplicated and complicated utis without indwelling catheter and in the patients without surgery in complicated utis with indwelling catheter.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). i. susceptibility distribution].
the bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 13 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2002 and july 2003. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. the number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/ml. the susceptibility of staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (ctm) was relatively good. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc), imipenem (ipm), and vcm showed the strongest antibacterial activity (mic90: 2-4 microg/ml). in addition, the low sensitive strains (mic: > or = 256 microg/ml) to clarithromycin (cam) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (czop). the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially czop and cefpirome (cpr) showed the highest activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. the antibacterial activity of cephems to citrobacter freundii was generally low but czop and cpr had a strong acitivity (mic90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the antibacterial activity of cephems to klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (cmx), cefixime (cfix), flomoxef (fmox), cpr, and czop showed stronger activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). against serratia marcescens, meropenem (mepm) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by cpr and czop. against proteus mirabilis, cmx, ceftazidime (caz), cpr, mepm, carumonam (crmn), and levofloxacin (lvfx) showed the strongest activity (mc90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). among other cephems, czop and cfix were also strong (mic90: 0.25 microg/ml). the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/ml except ipm and amikacin (amk) having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was relatively good (mic50: 8 microg/ml).
newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.
control of microorganisms in vitro by endodontic irrigants.
the aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and antimicrobial effectiveness by the direct exposure test of 4 endodontic irrigants [1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)2; prepared with 1 g of ca(oh)2 and 100 ml of sterile distilled water), a solution of ca(oh)2 + detergent (hct20)] for s. aureus, e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis, c. albicans and a mixed culture. microbial growth was analyzed by two methods: turbidity of the culture medium that was confirmed by gram stain and subculture in a specific nutrient broth. in the dilution test, naocl solution showed mic equal to 0.1% for s. aureus, e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa and c. albicans and equal to 1% for b. subtilis and the mixed culture. chx (2%) presented mic equal to 0.000002% for s. aureus, 0.02% for e. faecalis, b. subtilis, c. albicans and the mixed culture and 0.002% for p. aeruginosa. ca(oh)2 solution (1%) showed mic greater than 1% for all the microorganisms except p. aeruginosa for which it was equal to 1%. calcium hydroxide solution + detergent showed mic equal to 4.5 ml for s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis, c. albicans and the mixed culture and greater than 4.5 ml for e. faecalis. in the direct exposure test, naocl had better antimicrobial effectiveness for all microorganisms at all times. chx (2%) was effective for s. aureus, e. faecalis and c. albicans at all times, and ineffective for p. aeruginosa, b. subtilis and the mixed culture. the other solutions showed the worst results.
[nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred thirty one bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between september and december 2001. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. with regard to the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of cases aged lower than 50 years was few and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent in male patients. in females, the number of patients aged lower than 20 years was few. most of female patients aged lower than 80 years had uncomplicated utis. as for the relationship between type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased as the infections were more complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis increased as the infections were more complicated. in relation of these results to age of patients, isolation frequency of e. coli gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and older with uncomplicated utis. the isolation frequencies of e. faecalis decreased with aging in the patients with complicated utis without indwelling catheter while p. aeruginosa decreased with aging in the patients with complicated utis with indwelling catheter. e. coli was isolated a few after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated after administration in the patients with all types of infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and with or without surgical operation, e. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter, while p. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. in uncomplicated utis, isolation frequencies of klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis were significant in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis without indwelling catheter, klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis with indwelling catheter, s. aureus and staphylococcus spp. were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
[activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in japan].
a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%. however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis, the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin compared to other quinolones against recent clinical bacterial isolates from hospitalized and community-based cancer patients.
the in vitro spectrum of moxifloxacin (a c-8-methoxyquinolone) was compared to that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against 924 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. moxifloxacin was more active than the comparator agents against gram-positive pathogens, with potent activity against aerococcus spp., listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus spp., rhodococcus equi, and stomatococcus mucilaginous, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., all beta hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. it also had good to moderate activity against bacillus spp., corynebacterium spp., enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae, moxifloxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at < or =2.0 microg/ml. moxifloxacin was the least active of the three agents tested against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but had significant activity against other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli including acinetobacter spp., flavobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp. other than p. aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the overall broad spectrum of moxifloxacin, and its availability for both oral and parenteral administration, warrants its evaluation for the prevention and treatment of infections in cancer patients.
antimicrobial activity and interference of tobramycin and chloramphenicol on bacterial adhesion to intraocular lenses.
the antimicrobial activities of tobramycin and chloramphenicol were evaluated by  determining minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, group a, group b and group g streptococci, klebsiella spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ciprofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as by evaluating interference on adhesion of slime producer strains of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa to intraocular lens from tobramycin and chloramphenicol pharmaceutical products by scanning electron microscopy. chloramphenicol was more active against gram-positive bacteria than was tobramycin, which instead showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin-susceptible p. aeruginosa. treatment of lenses with the antimicrobial products eradicated the bacterial biofilm, which was already notably reduced after 5 min. this activity was more pronounced for chloramphenicol against s. aureus and for tobramycin against p. aeruginosa. bacterial adhesion was also significantly reduced when lenses colonized by p. aeruginosa were treated with chloramphenicol, even if they were resistant to this drug. in conclusion, the tested drugs showed marked antibacterial activity, particularly by interfering with bacterial biofilms. the data obtained in this study suggest a specific use of chloramphenicol in topical prophylaxis aimed at avoiding bacterial contaminations. however, further specific in vivo studies are needed to confirm these data.
in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.
antimicrobial activity of a novel des-fluoro (6) quinolone, garenoxacin (bms-284756), compared to other quinolones, against clinical isolates from cancer patients.
the in vitro spectrum of a novel des-fluoro (6) quinolone, garenoxacin (bms-284756), was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin against 736 clinical isolates from cancer patients. garenoxacin was the most active agent overall against gram-positive organisms, with potent activity against aerococcus spp., micrococcus spp., rhodococcus equi, stomatococcus mucilaginous, bacillus spp., enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., and all beta-hemolytic and viridans streptococci. although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae garenoxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at <or=4.0 microg/ml, its proposed susceptibility break-point. all 4 agents had sub-optimal activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and variable activity against other non-fermenters, with stenotrophomonas maltophila and alcaligenes spp. being the most resistant isolates. the overall broad spectrum of garenoxacin warrants its evaluation for the prevention or treatment of infections in cancer patients.
total synthesis and biological evaluation of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid, an inhibitor of human topoisomerase i.
the naturally occurring (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid was synthesized stereochemically pure in six steps starting with commercially available 1,5-hexadiyne. the title compound was antimicrobial against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus (mic 80 microm) and streptococcus faecalis (mic 200 microm), but inactive against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid completely inhibits human topoisomerase i at a concentration of 800 microm, while 5,9-hexadecadiynoic acid and hexadecanoic acid do not inhibit topoisomerase i (>1000 microm). this comparison reveals that the cis double bond geometry in the title compound is required for topoisomerase i inhibition. moreover, these results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid against either s. aureus or s. faecalis could be a result, at least in part, of the inhibitory activity of the acid against topoisomerases.
antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinically relevant blood culture isolates from nine surgical intensive care units, 1996-2000.
in order to elucidate trends in the incidence and susceptibility profiles of causative agents of bacteremia/fungemia in nine surgical intensive care units, a total of 744 isolates obtained during a 5-year period (1996-2000) were studied. the isolates included 698 bacteria and 46 fungi obtained from 523 positive blood cultures, representing 317 episodes of bacteremia/fungemia. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 2.3 episodes per 1000 surgical icu admissions in 1996, 1.6 in 1997, 0.3 in 1998, 0.6 in 1999, and 1.7 in 2000. one enterococcus faecalis (vana) isolate resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin was recovered in 1996. ciprofloxacin resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 36% in 1996 to 20% in 2000, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins decreased from 40% in 1996 to 9% in 2000. in light of differences between these results and those found elsewhere, these findings might prove useful for making infection control policy decisions in intensive care units.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred eighty eight bacterial strains isolated from 435 patients diagnosed  as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2000 and july 2001. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. about the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. in females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. the majority of female patients aged 40 years and over had complicated utis while uncomplicated utis was most frequent in the patients being twenties. as for type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa increased when the infection became complicated. enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently in complicated utis than in uncomplicated utis. considering this result by age of patients, isolated frequency of e. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and over with uncomplicated utis or complicated utis without indwelling catheter. the isolated frequencies of klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis were high in the patients with complicated utis without indwelling catheter. in the patients aged 70 years and over with complicated utis with indwelling catheter, p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated. as for type of causative organisms in utis before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in the patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter. e. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa increased after administration in the patients with all types of infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and surgical procedures, e. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in all types of infections, while p. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery. in uncomplicated utis, proteus spp. and e. faecalis were frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis without indwelling catheter, klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery and e. faecalis was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. in complicated utis with indwelling catheter, most of organisms except p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.
in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
antimicrobial effect of resveratrol on dermatophytes and bacterial pathogens of the skin.
the phytoalexin resveratrol is commonly found in food and drinks, including red wine, grapes, and peanuts. many studies have shown that this compound has anti-inflammatory properties, and it has been ascribed as having health benefits that help to prevent cancer and coronary heart disease. a treatment that combines antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions may be desirable for alleviating many skin conditions that range in severity. therefore, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of resveratrol against bacteria and dermatophytes that are major etiologic agents of human skin infections. using the broth microdilution protocol of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) m7-a5, growth of the bacterial species staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited at 171-342 microg/ml of resveratrol in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. using the nccls protocol m38-p, activity against the fungal species trichophyton mentagrophytes, trichophyton tonsurans, trichophyton rubrum, epidermophyton floccosum, and microsporum gypseum was also tested. the growth of dermatophytes was inhibited at 25-50 microg/ml of resveratrol. thus, this study indicates a novel application for resveratrol, a molecule of plant defense, to combat human fungal pathogens. resveratrol and its analogs may have wide application to skin conditions that afflict a significant portion of our population, and may also have promising clinical potentials in diabetic wounds.
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
the bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined and the results were compared with those obtained between 1991 and 1998. comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those with uncomplicated utis and those with complicated utis (including with or without indwelling catheter). about e. faecalis, increase of low sensitive strains noted in the former year showed a decreasing tendency, however, one strain each with mic of 4 micrograms/ml to vancomycin (vcm) was detected in patients with both uncomplicated and complicated utis. as for s. aureus, many sensitive strains to cephems, imipenem (ipm) and vcm were noted, and each mic50 was better than that in the former years. s. aureus strains showing low susceptibility to arbekacin (abk) were detected in patients with complicated utis in this year as well as in the former year, and one strain each with mic of 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml was detected. susceptibilities of e. coli were effective to all drugs except for penicillins and minocycline (mino). decrease of low sensitive strains was also noted in all drugs except for quinolones. each mic90 of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and sparfloxacin (spfx) in patients with complicated utis against e. coli was 3 degrees classes lower than that in patients with uncomplicated utis. as for klebsiella pneumoniae, decrease of low sensitive strains to cephems was noted in patients with uncomplicated utis in 1998. in 1999, low sensitive strains decreased also in patients with complicated utis, and few were detected. susceptibilities of k. pneumoniae to quinolones were effective as compared with those in the former years with the mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below without detection of low sensitive strains. one low sensitive strain of k. pneumoniae with mic of 8 micrograms/ml was detected for gentamicin (gm). susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems were notable. the mic90 of meropenem (mepm) and ipm was 4 micrograms/ml each which was 2 degrees better than that in 1998. resistant p. aeruginosa strains to other drugs except for monobactams decreased in 1999.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). ii. background of patients].
five-hundred forty four bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of isolation of bacteria by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of administration of antibiotics, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. about the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. in females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent among female patients aged between 40 to 59 years, in other age groups, uncomplicated utis was most frequent. as for type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis increased when the infection became complicated. considering this result by age of patients, isolation frequency of e. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged more than 20 years with uncomplicated utis or complicated utis without indwelling catheter. the isolation frequencies of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus were gradually increased with aging in complicated utis without indwelling catheter. in patients with complicated utis with indwelling catheter, there was no difference between age group, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated. as for type of causative organisms in utis before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter. e. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis increased after administration in patients with all infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and surgical procedures, e. coli were more frequently isolated in patients with uncomplicated utis when surgical procedures were experienced. also, klebsiella spp. and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated in patients with surgical procedures. however, in complicated utis, type of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.
antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from cinnamomum osmophloeum.
the antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (a and b) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. the nine strains of bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon b leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. the mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the b leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both k. pneumoniae and salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. the mics of cinnamaldehyde against the e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, mrsa, k. pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and v. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that c. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
the antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (ah plus, sealapex, ketac endo, and fill canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (calen and calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541. there was a wild strain of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with brain heart infusion agar and muller hinton medium seeded by pour plate. calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% ttc gel and inhibition haloes were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. however, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by ah plus, fill canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. we conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% ttc gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
antibacterial spectrum of a novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone, bms-284756.
the in vitro spectrum of a novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone, bms-284756, was compared with those of five fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin). bms-284756 was among the most active and often was the most active quinolone against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci, pneumococci (including ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible and penicillin-resistant strains), and enterococcus faecalis. bms-284756 inhibited approximately 60 to approximately 70% of the enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-resistant) strains and 90 to 100% of the enterobacteriaceae strains and gastroenteric bacillary pathogens at the anticipated mic susceptible breakpoint (</=4 microg/ml). against the nonfermenters, bms-284756 inhibited 90 to 100% of pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas stutzeri, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, flavobacterium spp., and acinetobacter spp. and 72% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains at 4 microg/ml. against anaerobic bacteria, bms-284756 was among the most active, inhibiting essentially all strains tested. it had very low mics against the fastidious and atypical microbial species, in particular against mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia, and gonococci. these results indicate that with its broad antibacterial spectrum, bms-284756 should be evaluated clinically for the treatment of community and nosocomial infections.
[results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in hiroshima city to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. hiroshima levofloxacin susceptibility surveillance group].
to evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. among gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. to reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.
bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin (am-1155) against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis in an in vitro bladder model simulating human urinary concentrations after oral administration.
the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was determined in a dynamic in vitro model mimicking complicated lower urinary tract infection. strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis with different susceptibility were exposed to changing gatifloxacin concentrations, simulating human urinary concentrations afer oral treatment with 200 mg twice daily for 3 consecutive days. bacterial numbers of p. aeruginosa (minimal inhibitory concentrations, mic: < or =32 microg/ml) and of e. faecalis (mic: 16 microg/ml) were reduced to undetectable levels during exposure. for the strains with lower susceptibility, gatifloxacin showed bactericidal activity, but eradication was not complete. thus, in a complicated urinary tract infection model, breakpoint mics of gatifloxacin for uropathogenic organisms were presumed to range from 16 to 32 microg/ml. at least 86% of recent clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were inhibited at its breakpoint mic. these results suggest that gatifloxacin may be useful in the treatment of urinary tract infections.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). iii secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, echerichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 hospitals during june 1997 to may 1998, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. e. faecalis the mic90s of quinolones for e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis have changed better state during the latest period. among e. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin (abpc) and minocycline (mino) appeared to had decreased during period of 1995-1997, which recovered during the latest period. 2. s. aureus the sensitive strains of s. aureus to imipenem (ipm) and clindamycin (cldm) had increased during the period of 1996-1997, but those have decreased again during the latest period. 3. e. coli the susceptibilities of e. coli to mino have been better in the latest period with the mic90 was ranged from 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. the susceptibilities to quinolones of e. coli isolated from complicated utis had decreased during the period of 1995-1997, but those have recovered during the latest period. 4. klebsiella spp. among klebsiella spp. strains isolated from uncomplicated utis, those with low susceptibilities to almost cephems have increased in the latest period. to other antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp. did not show any changes during the latest period. 5. p. aeruginosa the susceptibilities to most agents of p. aeruginosa did not show any changes, the decreased susceptibilities to cefozopran (czop), carbapenems and monobactams of p. aeruginosa observed in 1996 appeared to have been retrieved in 1997. these susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
the preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from combretum erythrophyllum (combretaceae).
freeze dried ground leaves of combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. both techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. the best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. the six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. s. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (36%), escherichia coli (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). with s. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for s. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to mic values of 0.08 and 0.16 mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. there were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. the polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.
toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
the ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. the amounts of h2o2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of h2o2 produced. the more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of h2o2 production. in addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when h2o2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. however, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.
men 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, pbp affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
the in-vitro activity of men 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that men 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < or = 0.5 mg/l) and against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 mg/l), with reduced activity only against providencia stuartii (mic90 = 8 mg/l). men 10700 was also active against anaerobic species such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis as well as moraxella catarrhalis. it was moderately active against enterococcus faecalis and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. men 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class i enzymes. it bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of escherichia coli.
urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.
in-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
the toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. in several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 j/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
does tea tree oil have a place in the topical treatment of burns?
burnaid is a sorbalene-based cream containing 40 mg/g of tea tree oil and 1 mg/g  of triclosan. this investigation was carried out to determine the effect of burnaid, a commercial tea tree oil preparation, against enterococcus faecalis (atcc29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc29213), escherichia coli (atcc25922), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc27853), with the activity of the base product in the commercial preparation. the organisms were suspended in sterile saline (0.5 mcfarland standard) and inoculated onto horse blood agar (e. faecalis and s. aureus) or mueller-hinton agar (e. coli and p. aeruginosa). one hundred microliters of burnaid unsterilized, burnaid sterilized and the base product (tinasolve) were placed in duplicate in wells cut into the agar plates. sterility and inactivation cultures were also performed on the samples. none of the samples were found to be contaminated with bacteria prior to testing. only s. aureus and e. coli showed zones of growth inhibition around the burnaid and tinasolve. zones of growth inhibition (22 mm) were similar for the active product (burnaid) and the base (tinasolve). there was no activity against e. faecalis or p. aeruginosa. in view of our findings and literature indicating the cytotoxicity of tea tree oil against human fibroblasts and epithelial cells, it is recommended that this product should not be used on burn wounds.
the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
therapeutic effects of cefozopran against experimental mixed urinary tract infection with enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice.
the therapeutic activity of cefozopran, a new semisynthetic parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ampicillin, imipenem/cilastatin and ofloxacin against an ascending mixed urinary tract infection induced in mice with enterococcus faecalis tn2005 and pseudomonas aeruginosa p9. cefozopran significantly reduced viable cell counts of both organisms in the kidneys. ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin and ofloxacin were active against only p. aeruginosa, and ampicillin was active against only e. faecalis.
in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during june 1994 to may 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated utis, complicated utis without indwelling catheter, and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. no remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. the susceptibilities of e. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. as for s. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated utis. against e. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. as for klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to abpc decreased. the susceptibilities of p. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. against p. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. these data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
growth inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis by crude extractives of mansonia altisima timber sawdust.
crude, aqueous methanol and ethanol extracts of sawdust of mansonia (mansonia altisima) timber inhibited pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 4.4 to 9.3 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentration was 10.0-25.0 mg/ml. enterococcus faecalis was more susceptible, but no marked difference occurred in the antibacterial effect of methanol and ethanol extracts. the aqueous extract was less active.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].

[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1990). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during june 1990 to may 1991 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated utis, complicated utis without indwelling catheter, and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. the susceptibilities of e. faecalis to minocycline (mino) and ofloxacin (oflx) has decreased. as for citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and p. mirabilis, which were detected very few in 1989 and 1990, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. the susceptibilities of e. coli to mino was observed a very clear alteration, that is, in uncomplicated utis and complicated utis, the susceptibilities has decreased. however, the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa and serratia spp. were not observed an obvious variation.
comparative in vitro activity of apalcillin alone and combined with ro 48-1220, a novel penam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
objective: the in vitro activity of apalcillin plus ro 48-1220, a novel penam sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with apalcillin alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. methods: agar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5% carbon dioxide, was carried out to determine the minimum bactericidal (mbc) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of each of the study drugs in accordance with the nccls m26-t method. results: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except klebsiella oxytoca (mic90 32 microg/ml). among the enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (4 microg/ml fixed concentration) vs apalcillin alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing mic90 results. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was highly potent against beta-lactamase-producing moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics less-than-or-equal 1 microg/ml). however, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of ro 48-1220 alone (mics less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). all pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia and acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (mic90 0.25 to 4 microg/ml). for the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, corynebacterium jeikeium and enterococcus species other than e. faecalis. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum tem enzymes, but less active against isolates producing shv-type beta-lactamases. when tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78%, 91% and 66% of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (less-than-or-equal 16 microg/ml). conclusions: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy.
in vitro activity of sce-2787, a new cephalosporin with potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
the in vitro activity of sce-2787, 7-[(z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium)methy l-3- cephem-4-carboxylate, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem against recent clinical isolates. sce-2787 inhibited 50% of tested isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. sce-2787 was equally active as or more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against members of the enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of proteus vulgaris. the mic of sce-2787 at which 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited was 2 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem and ceftazidime, respectively. sce-2787, like ceftazidime and imipenem, did not inhibit the majority of strains of pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia. sce-2787 inhibited beta-hemolytic streptococci at < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, or the anaerobic species tested. methicillin-resistant staphylococci required sce-2787 mics of > or = 16 micrograms/ml, whereas methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. no difference between the mics and mbcs was noted, except for p. aeruginosa, for which there was a fourfold difference. sce-2787 was active over a ph range of 6 to 8. the inoculum size of 10(5) to 10(7) cfu caused only a twofold change in the mic for escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but a 4- to 16-fold change in enterobacter cloacae and p. aeruginosa. beta-lactamases from bush groups 1, 2a, and 2b did not hydrolyze sce-2787. there was significant hydrolysis of sce-2787 by the beta-lactamases designated 2b', i.e., tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, and tem-9, and by the group 2d beta-lactamases. sce-2787 had poor affinity for group 1 and group 2b enzymes and constitutively produced chromosomal beta-lactamases such as p-99 of enterobacter cloacae and plasmid-mediated tem-1 of e. coli. sce-2787 has in vitro activity comparable to that of current parenteral cephalosporin and is more active against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.
prediction of piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility among enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other bacteria using ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and other broad-spectrum antimicrobial in vitro test results.
the ability of various in vitro beta-lactam susceptibility test results to predict the susceptibility of piperacillin-tazobactam (a new beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) was assessed using more than 46,000 recent clinical isolates. the organisms were tested by reference-quality national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) broth microdilution procedures and interpreted by the currently published nccls criteria. the recommended antimicrobial tests that would accurately predict the piperacillin-tazobactam in vitro efficacy had an overall very major, false-susceptible rate of only 0.6% (< or = 1.5% is acceptable). the following drug tests can be used to judge piperacillin-tazobactam activity and spectrum (low patient risk) conservatively: for enterobacteriaceae use ticarcillin-clavulanic acid results (0.6% very major error); for pseudomonas aeruginosa use piperacillin (0.1%) results; for enterococci use ampicillin or ampicillin-sulbactam (1.8%) results; for haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis use cefotaxime or cefuroxime or ceftriaxone (1.5%); and for staphylococci use oxacillin by nccls recommendations. when the piperacillin-tazobactam testing reagents become available, the direct testing of this combination should be applied to relevant clinical isolates. the piperacillin-tazobactam break points should be reassessed as indicated by the cited minimum inhibitory concentration population analysis to improve predictive accuracy; h. influenzae susceptibility modified to < or = 2/4 micrograms/ml and enterococcus species susceptibility tested at < or = 16/4 micrograms.
combination effect of meropenem with aminoglycosides and teicoplanin on pseudomonas and enterococci.
the in vitro activity of meropenem, a new carbapenem, and the combination effect  with netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, and teicoplanin against pseudomonas spp. and enterococci was studied. meropenem showed very good in vitro activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and good to moderate activity against pseudomonas putida (mic90 4 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 8 mg/l). aminoglycosides were highly active against p. putida (mic90 0.5 mg/l), but showed only moderate activity against p. aeruginosa. the synergistic effect of meropenem was shown in combination with teicoplanin against e. faecalis (40%). no pseudomonas strains were inhibited by the synergistic effect of meropenem with aminoglycosides. no antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
in-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
the in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and  e-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. against majority of enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial activities of e-4749 (mic90s 0.06-1 mg/l), e-4874 (mic90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/l) and e-4884 (mic90s 0.01-0.5 mg/l) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (mic90s 0.01-0.25 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90s 0.01-1 mg/l). the activity of e-4904 (mic90s 0.06-2 mg/l) was lower than those of its analogues. most of the escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) and serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-lactamase producing strains of moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (mics < or = 0.008 mg/l). most of pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa pseudomonas spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the new quinolones (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l). on the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the aeromonas spp. (mic90s < or = 0.5 mg/l). e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and e-4904 remained active (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. however, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.03 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l). against s. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (mic90s 2- > 16 mg/l). most of the strains of enterococcus faecalis were resistant (mic90s > 16 mg/l). the activity of e-4874, e-4904 and sparfloxacin (mic90 1 mg/l for each one) was higher than that of the rest of the agents tested. e-4874 (mic90 0.25 mg/l) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (mic90 2 mg/l) against listeria monocytogenes. no new quinolone was active against bacteroides fragilis (mic90s 4-16 mg/l), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l), and other b. fragilis group (mic90s 16- > 16 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mic90s > 16 mg/l), and sparfloxacin (mic90s 8-16 mg/l) also were inactive. e-4874 (mic90 4 mg/l) was the most active quinolone tested against b.fragilis.
minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various national committee for clinical laboratory standards susceptibility test methods. quality control study group.
several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (qc) giudelines. replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended qc strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. in addition qc mic ranges, using appropriate medium modification for haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226 were reported on four (du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and fk-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
bactericidal properties of crude extracts of mitracarpus villosus.
mature leaves and inflorescence of mitracarpus villosus, collected from niger state, nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. the crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. the extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. the ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
[prevalence of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility: a multicenter study in akita prefecture].
we report the prevalence of bacterial pathogens isolated from various clinical specimens in 17 medical centers in akita during the period of december 1990 to february 1991, and their antimicrobial susceptibility. the results were as follows: 1. the total number of isolates was 8,929 and common bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), escherichia coli (10.1%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (6.7%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.0%). this is similar to our previous result which was reported in the same season in 1987. 2. s. aureus was a common isolate from sputum, throat swab, pus, and blood. 53% of isolated s. aureus were methicillin-resistant. arbekacin (abk) had a high degree of activity (99%) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). minocycline (mino) retained activity against 70% of mrsa strains, and quinolones only 20%. 3. p. aeruginosa and e. coli were frequently found in urine from the patients in the small hospitals. more than 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains were sensitive to imipenem (ipm), cefsulodin (cfs) and amikacin (amk). the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime (caz) and piperacillin (pipc) had been decreasing for the last 3 years. 4. cns were frequently found in blood, pus, and pleural effusion from the patients in the large hospitals. the isolates were resistant to most antibiotics. 5. enterococcus was common isolates from urine and ascites, the susceptibility to cephem was low. 6. we conclude that attention should be specially paid to s. aureus, p. aeruginosa cns and e. faecalis.
in vitro activities of bay y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
bay y3118 was highly active against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). for enterococcus faecalis and corynebacterium jeikeium, mic90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. bay y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
[evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (cez) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the mueller-hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) cfu/ml. the reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using mueller-hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) cfu/cm2 in estimating approximate values of mics. in addition, antimicrobial activities of cez and cefmetazole (cmz) or flomoxef (fmox) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) using the checkerboard agar dilution mic method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained cez, cmz, and fmox alone, or cez, and cmz or fmox in combination. in this study, the mics of cez against s. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. mics against mssa were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against mrsa were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. mics against majority of strains of enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. over 90% of strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. about 60% of isolates of indole negative proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but mics against indole positive proteus spp., serratia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activities of cez against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for s. aureus. highly resistant strains of s. aureus to cez were more prevalent in this study. the inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with mics. the results of cez disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, break points in mic values proposed are () mic < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. the disk results with e. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of e1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vitro activities of e1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic of e1077 for 90% of the strains tested [mic90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. against enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), e1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. the mic90s of e1077 for streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; e1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. e1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). the activity of e1077 against p. aeruginosa (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. in vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. e1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. the protective effects of e1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of e1077 caused swelling of s. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in p. aeruginosa. in general, the antibacterial profile of e1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
in vitro evaluation of e1077, a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a wide spectrum of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, e1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) of 0.78 micrograms/ml. methicillin-resistant s. aureus was moderately to highly resistant to e1077, but e1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. against enterococcus faecalis, e1077 was the most active of the cephalosporins tested (mic90, 12.5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml, e1077 inhibited 90% of streptococci and most of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris, for which the mic90s of e1077 were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, e1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. for the anaerobes, e1077 was as active against bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. e1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for e1077.
in vitro activity of sparfloxacin compared with those of five other quinolones.
the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 857 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and lomefloxacin. the mic of sparfloxacin for 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested was 0.5 microgram/ml (range, 0.06 to 4.0 micrograms/ml); only for members of the genera serratia, citrobacter, and providencia were mics above 1 microgram/ml. some 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 8 micrograms of the drug per ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus spp. and enterococcus faecalis were 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. all (100%) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. the inoculum size had little effect on either the mic or the mbc of sparfloxacin. an increase in the magnesium concentration from 1.1 to 8.4 mm increased the mic between 2 and 10 times, depending on the genus tested. sparfloxacin was less active at ph 5. the antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria was generally higher than those of the quinolones with which it was compared; against streptococcus pneumoniae, sparfloxacin was four- and eightfold more active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the activity of sparfloxacin against gram-negative rods was generally comparable to that of ciprofloxacin except against enterobacter and acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas cepacia, xanthomonas maltophilia, and alcaligenes and flavobacterium spp., against which sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone.
in vitro activities of sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin.
the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with those of tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin against 730 bacterial isolates representing 49 different species. sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin had similar spectra of activity, but sparfloxacin was less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and more active against many gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. tosufloxacin mics were generally 8- to 16-fold lower than those for sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. all four fluoroquinolones were active against nalidixic acid-susceptible strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic for 90% of the isolates [mic90], less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml) but nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible (mic90, greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml). against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, mic90s were 1.0 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 2.0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 4.0 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin. against enterococcus faecalis, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin mic90s were 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic90s for ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were 0.016 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 0.06 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin, and 0.5 micrograms/ml for both ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin. with four species of gram-negative bacilli, mutants resistant to two to four times the sparfloxacin mic occurred spontaneously at frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-9): single-step high-level resistance was not observed. in vitro-selected sparfloxacin-resistant mutants displayed cross-resistance to other quinolones, as did clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus. tosufloxacin mics with broth microdilution methods were four- to eightfold greater than those obtained with agar dilution methods. the two procedures gave comparable results when sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin was being tested.

the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth of candida, cryptococcus, and other yeasts  in simulated blood culture bottles.
the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood contained in liquid culture medium increased the dissolved-o2 partial pressure in direct proportion to the volume injected. the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the growth of subcultured clinical isolates of candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, torulopsis glabrata, and other yeasts and on the growth of blood culture isolates of representative pathogenic bacteria was compared with its effect on their growth in vented and unvented stationary bottles. c. albicans and c. neoformans grew significantly better in bottles to which hydrogen peroxide had been added than in vented or unvented bottles. the advantage of hydrogen peroxide over venting was most marked with several slowly growing strains. similar results were obtained in shaker cultures with strains of c. albicans which were inoculated directly from positive blood cultures. the effect of hydrogen peroxide tended to diminish during serial passage. t. glabrata grew less well when hydrogen peroxide was added, perhaps because of the absence of oxidase. the growth of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis was not significantly inhibited or augmented by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. the growth of escherichia coli was inhibited slightly. the value of the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood cultures to improve the isolation of yeasts needs to be established by a clinical trial which would compare this method with established methods.
interpretive criteria of antimicrobial disk susceptibility tests with flomoxef.
320 recently isolated pathogens, 20 strains from each of 16 species, were investigated using mueller-hinton agar and din as well as nccls standards. the geometric mean of the agar dilution mics of flomoxef were 0.44 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.05 mg/l (klebsiella oxytoca) to 12.6 mg/l (enterobacter spp.) for enterobacteriaceae, 33.1 mg/l for acinetobacter anitratus, 64 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis, and more than 256 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa. for disk susceptibility testing of flomoxef a 30 micrograms disk loading and the following interpretation of inhibition zones using the din method were recommended: resistant-up to 22 mm (corresponding to mics of 8 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible-23 to 29 mm (corresponding to mics from 1 to 4 mg/l), and susceptible-30 mm or more (corresponding to mics of 0.5 mg/l or less). the respective values for the nccls method using the american high mic breakpoints are: resistant--up to 14 mm (corresponding to mics of 32 mg/l or more), moderately susceptible--15 to 17 mm (corresponding to mics of 16 mg/l), and susceptible--18 mm or more (corresponding to mics of 8 mg/l or less).
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
in vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. the results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. imipenem (ipm) showed potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae. 2. ipm had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated enterobacteriaceae, that is, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus spp. 3. ipm showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus but not against xanthomonas maltophilia.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
disinfection by endodontic irrigants and dressings of experimentally infected dentinal tubules.
the effect of endodontic irrigants and dressings was tested on bacteria in bovine dentin specimens experimentally infected with enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. standardized, cylindrical dentin test pieces were prepared and cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with edta and sodium hypochlorite. the specimens were infected with the test organism for periods up to 14 days, and the degree of infection into the tubules was monitored using brown & brenn stain, scanning electron microscopy, and culturing of dentin dust from sequential bur samples starting from the pulpal side. e. faecalis rapidly infected the whole length of the tubules; s. sanguis required up to 2 weeks for complete infection; e. coli only penetrated to some 600 microns, even after prolonged incubation periods. p. aeruginosa infected dentin quickly, but apparently in very low numbers. e. faecalis persisted for at least 10 d after withdrawal of nutrient support, whereas the other 3 organisms died within 4 to 48 h. endodontic medicaments were applied to infected specimen for comparison of antibacterial potency. camphorated p-monochlorophenol was generally more efficient than calasept, and of the irrigants tested, iodine potassium iodide appeared more potent than sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. the presence of a smear layer delayed, but did not eliminate, the effect of the medicaments.
[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). ii. background of patients].
in the retrospective survey of the sensitivity of clinical isolates reported in this journal, patients' backgrounds were also investigated. some findings are summarized below. 1. age distribution by sex: patients with ages 50 years and older accounted for a majority, irrespective of their sexes amounting 67.6% for both sexes combined. 2. annual distribution of sexes by age group: females accounted for a majority in younger age brackets, but the proportion of males increased with age, accounting for a majority in patients 70 years or older. this pattern has been repeated practically every year. 3. distribution of infection types by sex: complicated urinary tract infections were predominant in males, while simple urinary tract infections were more frequent in females. 4. annual distribution of sexes by type of infection: complicated and simple urinary tract infections combined accounted for approximately 70% in both males and females. this pattern has been repeated practically every year. 5. distribution of infection types by age: patients of advanced ages were predominant as a whole but this trend was particularly pronounced in complicated urinary tract infection cases. 6. annual distribution of infection types by age: the frequency of simple urinary tract infections among patients older than 20 years of age declined with age and this pattern has been repeated practically every year. among patients older than 20 years of age, annual frequencies of complicated urinary tract infections have been on the decrease. 7. distribution of isolated bacteria by sex: escherichia coli was more frequent in females, while enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequent in males. compared with the previous year, the frequencies of coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus spp., and e. coli increased, while that of p. aeruginosa decreased. 8. distribution of isolated bacteria by age: e. coli was most frequent on the whole, followed by e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci, in that order. by age group, e. coli was frequent in younger patients and the frequencies of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa increased with age. 9. annual distribution of isolated bacteria by infection type: coagulase-negative staphylococci increased as a whole and p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens decreased compared to 1986, but e. coli continued to be the most frequent. e. coli was isolated from a majority of simple urinary tract infection cases. the frequencies of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa were high in cases of complicated urinary tract infections.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
the in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., and bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against morganella morganii. enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. in general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against klebsiella spp., c. diversus, x. maltophilia, and bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against escherichia coli and proteeae. there was little or no enhancement of activity against enterococcus faecalis, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, or acinetobacter anitratus. clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. in a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis, and s. aureus; the latter was more active against e. faecalis. for relatively susceptible strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and p. cepacia, similar in activity against a. anitratus, and less active against x. maltophilia and bacteroides spp.
comparative in vitro activity of sm7338, a new carbapenem antimicrobial agent.
the comparative in vitro activity of sm7338 was tested against 670 routine clinical isolates and 130 cefoperazone-resistant isolates of bacteria by agar dilution methods. sm7338 was at least as active as imipenem against gram-negative organisms but was slightly less active against gram-positive organisms. sm7338 was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics for 90% of strains of less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for all species tested. differences in activity between sm7338 and imipenem were particularly striking against proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii, against which mics of sm7338 and imipenem for 90% of strains were 0.125 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the presence of unique plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21 transconjugants did not affect activity substantially, except in the case of oxa-2 (eightfold-increased mic) and oxa-3 (fourfold-increased mic). sm7338 was also active against a laboratory-derived strain of p. aeruginosa which hyperproduced chromosomal beta-lactamase, inhibiting both the wild type and the mutant at a concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml.
comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, am-1091.
the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, am-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. am-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. for many species am-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. it inhibited enterobacter, citrobacter, and klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. ninety percent of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species am-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. am-1091 was more active against pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. am-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. am-1091 inhibited 90% of the bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. the frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. although am-1091 had lower in vitro activity at ph 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. am-1091 rapidly killed escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
lomefloxacin, a new difluoroquinolone: in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new difluoro-quinolone, was compared to  other antimicrobial agents against a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. against the enterobacteriaceae, the lomefloxacin mic inhibiting 90% of strains was less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. isolates were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. all staphylococci including methicillin-resistant organisms were susceptible at 1.0 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, listeria spp., and sero group b streptococci were more resistant with an mic90 of 8, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively.
comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, t-3262 (a-60969).
the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, t-3262 [a-60969; dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. t-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. ninety percent of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. it was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against pseudomonas cepacia and pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. the mic for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for enterococcus faecalis. it inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. the frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. t-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus.
activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
the in vitro antibacterial activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. e-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. e-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. in general, e-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics giving 90% inhibition for e-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the activity of e-3846 increased at acid ph; in contrast, acid ph caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. in vivo, e-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental s. faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
[susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
[ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.
the sensitivity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to ofloxacin.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 165 gram-negative rods, both fermentative and non-fermentative and against 57 gram-positive strains (coagulase-positive and -negative, staphylococci both methicillin-resistant and susceptible and streptococcus faecalis). minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by using the macrodilution test and activity was compared with nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime and gentamicin for gram-negative rods, norfloxacin and gentamicin for staphylococcus strains, and norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin and gentamicin for enterococci. ofloxacin inhibited all fermentative gram-negative bacteria tested, in a range of 0.05-3.12 micrograms/ml. it also had good antimicrobial activity against non-fermentative gram-negative strains: in fact it inhibited 90% of acinetobacter and 80% of pseudomonas aeruginosa tested at 3.12 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin had good antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus and enterococcus tested.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

concern over the development of drug resistance by common pathogens has grown over recent years. in order to discover and describe possible trends at this institution, susceptibility data for 18 organisms and 21 antimicrobial agents for the years 1975 through 1982 at the veterans administration medical center in oklahoma city were reviewed. summaries of susceptibility data for 64 major combinations of drugs and organisms are presented. two gram-positive organisms (enterococcus group d and staphylococcus aureus) as well as a gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa) appear to be decreasing in susceptibility to several drugs. however, some gram-negative bacilli (proteus, serratia, and enterobacter spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae) showed evidence of markedly increasing susceptibility to certain drugs.
[in vitro antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against uropathogenic organisms].
ciprofloxacin (bay 09867) is a new quinoline derivative. its activity against 537 urinary bacterial isolates was compared with those of ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, nalidixic and oxolinic acids, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and other antimicrobial agents, when appropriate. it inhibited 90% citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., e, coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp., and serratia spp. at less than or equal to 0.78 microgram/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin-resistant strains, was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.12 micrograms/ml. mics of bay 09867 for 90% of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus faecalis were 0.78 micrograms/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml respectively. bay 09867 inhibited organisms resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, nalidixic and oxolinic acids and trimethoprim.
in-vitro activity of enoxacin against aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli and other clinical isolates.
the in-vitro activity of enoxacin was tested against 500 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli that were resistant to one or more of gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, and against 1060 recent consecutive clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. enoxacin was active against staphylococci (mics less than or equal to 4 mg/l) but less active against streptococcus faecalis (mics mostly 8 mg/l). it was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) and very active against enterobacteriaceae. in the series of consecutive isolates 97% of enterobacteriaceae had mics less than or equal to 1 mg/l. the aminoglycoside-resistant series of enterobacteriaceae included more strains with higher mics (13% were 2-4 mg/l and 10% were greater than or equal to 8 mg/l); the majority of the isolates with mics greater than or equal to 8 mg/l); the majority of the isolates with mics greater than or equal to 8 mg/l were serratia marcescens and providencia spp. among the non-fermenting species the least sensitive were acinetobacter calcoaceticus and ps. maltophilia. enoxacin-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae were resistant to nalidixic acid, but nalidixic acid-resistant strains ranged from fully sensitive to highly resistant to enoxacin.
[comparative studies of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1982). i. susceptibility distribution].
in vitro activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated  from patients with urinary tract infections were investigated by dilution method using mic 2000 (dynatec) during july to october in 1982. the summarized results are as follows: pmpc and ccl have showed potent activities against e coli among the oral antimicrobial agents. pmpc and ccl at 3.13 micrograms/ml inhibited 90% of e. coli tested. ctm, ctx, czx, cmx and lmox at concentrations of 0.39 microgram/ml or less among the parenteral antimicrobial agents inhibited 90% of e. coli tested. the value of mic90 (concentration at which 90% of isolates are inhibited) against k. pneumoniae results in the resistant range for abpc, na, cex, ccl and st. among the parenteral cephems, cmx seemed most effective against k. pneumoniae tested. c. freundii seemed generally low susceptible to antimicrobial agents tested. among the oral agents, pmpc, ppa and st have showed moderate activity against c. freundii. among the parenteral agents, cmx and lmox also showed moderate activity against c. freundii, inhibiting 50% of the strains tested at 6.25 micrograms/ml. among the oral agents, pmpc showed the most potent activity against e. cloacae. e. cloacae tested were highly resistant to the first and second generation cephems. among the third generation, cmx seemed the most potent activity against e. cloacae isolated. however, cmx concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml was necessary to inhibit 50% of tested e. cloacae. p. mirabilis tested was resistant to all oral antimicrobial agents except ccl and st. the value of mic90 of the first and second generation cephems against p. mirabilis results in the moderately susceptible range (6.25-25 micrograms/ml). the third generation seemed most effective against p. mirabilis tested. pmpc, na, ppa and st concentrations of 0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml were necessary to inhibit 50% of tested p. vulgaris. cez and ctm, seemed less potent activity than cfx and cmz against p. vulgaris. ctx, czx, cmx and lmox except cpz have showed potent activities against p. vulgaris, these at 0.1 micrograms/ml or less inhibited 50% of p. vulgaris tested. p. aeruginosa has been resistant to the third generation cephems except cpz, but tob, gm, amk, cfs, pipc and cpz have showed high activities against p. aeruginosa, inhibiting 50% of the strains tested at 0.39-6.25 micrograms/ml. the oral antimicrobial agents, and first and second generation cephems had not showed significant activity against s. marcescens. and strains of s. marcescens were relatively susceptible to the third generation cephems.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
a comparison of the antibacterial activities of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) with those of other recently developed beta-lactam derivatives.
the antibacterial activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, 50 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 acinetobacter spp., 50 streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains and was compared with the recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefazedone, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. among the gram-negative bacteria, n-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime against klebsiella, serratia, and proteus spp. but had comparable activity against escherichia coli and enterobacter strains. activity of the thienamycin derivative was somewhat lower than that of moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. moreover, n-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active drug against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against streptococcus faecalis. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) in all gram-negative isolates tested. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (mic of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the thienamycin derivative (90% mic, 0.25 micrograms/ml); however, n-formimidoyl thienamycin was not bactericidal at the 90% mic. the antibacterial activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin against all of the gram-negative bacilli was observed to be independent of beta-lactamase production.
[activity of new beta-lactam antibiotics].
the antibacterial activity of the newer beta-lactam compounds mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, lamoxactam, and cefsulodin was evaluated in 335 strains of ampicillin-resistant (mic greater than 16 mg/l) enterobacteria, 50 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 28 acinetobacter species, and 50 streptococcus faecalis isolates. with the exception of some strains, enterobacteria were inhibited by low levels of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime, respectively. between these both compounds there was an almost complete cross-resistance. in each species lamoxactam inhibited at least 90% of the isolates. the antibacterial activity of cefoperazone against enterobacteria was decreased; however, it was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to that of azlocillin. cefsulodin proved to be the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa exceeding to some extent even piperacillin. ceftizoxime was the most active drug against acinetobacter species. among the new cephalosporins, it was only cefoperazone that exhibitediting antibacterial activity comparable to that of azlocillin. cefsulodin proved to be the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa exceeding to some extent even piperacillin. ceftizoxime was the most active drug against acinetobacter species. among the new cephalosporins, it was only cefoperazone that exhibitediting antibacterial activity comparable to that of azlocillin. cefsulodin proved to be the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa exceeding to some extent even piperacillin. ceftizoxime was the most active drug against acinetobacter species. among the new cephalosporins, it was only cefoperazone that exhibited some activity against streptococcus faecalis, which was comparable to that of cephalothin, but markedly impaired to that of cefazedone. with respect to streptococcus faecalis, the penicillin derivatives still remain the by far most active compounds.
two new inhibitory activities in blood of mice with delayed hypersensitivity, after challenge with specific antigen.
in addition to the activities associated with migration inhibitory factor and type ii interferon, two other inhibitory activities have been found in the sera of mice infected intravenously with bcg and 3 weeks later challenged intravenously with old tuberculin. growth of three bacteria, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one yeast, candida albicans, was inhibited in vitro by a factor or factors in the serum. also, hematopoiesis of mouse bone marrow cells in a soft agar medium was suppressed by the serum.
comparative in vitro activity of three aminoglycosidic antibiotics: bb-k8, kanamycin, and gentamicin.
kanamycin, bb-k8, and gentamicin were tested in parallel against 1,037 bacterial  strains isolated from clinical material. the activity of bb-k8 at 20 mug/ml was comparable to that of gentamicin at 8 mug/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa and against enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of gentamicin-resistant strains of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii, in which case the activities of bb-k8 and kanamycin were the same. bb-k8 exhibited little or no activity against streptococci. the activity of bb-k8 was affected by ph and inoculum size. a regression graph for inhibition data with a 10-mug disk of bb-k8 was developed, and synergistic activity of penicillin and bb-k8 against streptococcus faecalis was tested.
antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.
