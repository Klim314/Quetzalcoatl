TI  == time-dependent post mortem changes in the composition of intestinal bacteria using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == post mortem or even normal changes during life occurring in major gut bacterial populations are not known. we investigated bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp.,  clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea ratios in 7 fecal samples from healthy volunteers and in 61 autopsies rectum and cecum samples and studied the effect of post mortem time  using quantitative real-time pcr. bacterial ratios in stool samples from volunteers and rectum samples from autopsy cases were similar and did not change  significantly up to 5 days post mortem. in cecum, significant post mortem time-dependent differences were observed in ratios of bacteroides sp. (p = 0.014) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.024). our results showed that ratios of bacteroides  sp., bifidobacterium sp., clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea can be investigated in autopsy rectum samples up to 5 days after death.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

TI  == 16s rrna-based analysis of microbiota from the cecum of broiler chickens.
AB  == the microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. therefore, a survey of cecal  bacteria was done by retrieval of 16s rrna gene sequences from dna isolated from  the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. the ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature  gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). partial 16s rrna gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in ttge gels. a total of 1,656 partial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in  the genbank. the comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (clostridium leptum, sporomusa sp., clostridium coccoides, and enterics). sequences of members of the bacteroides group, the bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. sequences related to those from the escherichia sp. subgroup and from lactobacillus, pseudomonas, and bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited  in the genbank. sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. ttge and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative  differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.
