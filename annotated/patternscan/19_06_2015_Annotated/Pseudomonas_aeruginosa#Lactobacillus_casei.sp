TI  == evaluation of synergistic interactions between cell-free supernatant of lactobacillus strains and amikacin and genetamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background: the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the treatment of infectious  diseases can increase the development of antibiotic resistance. therefore, there  is a big demand for new sources of antimicrobial agents and alternative treatments for reduction of antibiotic dosage required to decrease the associated side effects. objectives: in this study, the synergistic action of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cell-free supernatant (cfs) of probiotic (lactobacillus rahmnosus and l. casei) against pseudomonas aeruginosa ptcc 1430 was evaluated. materials and methods: a growth medium for culturing of probiotic bacteria was separated by centrifugation. the antimicrobial effects of cfs of probiotic bacteria were evaluated using the agar well diffusion assay. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were evaluated using the micro dilution method. finally, an interaction between cfs and amikacin or gentamicin against p. aeruginosa ptcc 1430 was examined through the checkerboard method and fractional inhibitory concentration (fic). furthermore, cfss from lactobacillus strains were analyzed by reversed phase hplc (rp-hplc) for antimicrobial compounds. results: the results showed a significant effect of  cfs on the growth of p. aeruginosa. the mic and mbc of cfs from l. casei were 62.5 microlml while the mic and mbc of cfs from l. rhamnosus were 62.5 mulml and  125 mulml, respectively. using the fic indices, synergistic interactions were observed in combination of cfs and antibiotics. fractional inhibitory concentration indices of cfs from l. casei and aminoglycoside antibiotics were 0.124 and 0.312 while fic indices of cfs from l. rhamnosus and aminoglycoside antibiotics were 0.124 and 0.56, respectively showing a synergism effect. the results of rp-hplc showed that cfs of lactobacillus strains contained acetic acid, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotic bacterial strains of lactobacillus have a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of p. aeruginosa ptcc 1430. the antimicrobial potency of this combination can be useful for designing and developing alternative therapeutic strategies against p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by  numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli,  bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda  protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.

TI  == inhibitory activity of fermented milk with lactobacillus casei strain shirota against common multidrug-resistant bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections.
AB  == objective: to determine inhibitory activity of fermented milk with lactobacillus  casei strain shirota (fmlc) against common multi-drug-resistant (mdr) bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections. material and method: time-kill methods of fmlc and cell-free filtered fluid of fmlc (cf-fmlc) against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, esbl-producing escherichia coli & klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were conducted. the control solutions were mueller hinton broth (mhb) and distilled water. the mixtures of fmlc, cf-fmlc, mhb and dw with 10(5) to 10(6) cfu/ml of each bacterium were prepared and incubated at 35 degrees c. each mixture was quantified for viable bacteria at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr after incubation onto brain heart infusion agar plates. the inoculated agar plates were incubated at 35 degrees c for 24-48 hr. bacterial colonies on agar plates were counted and compared among the mixtures. results: log cfus of each organism in mhb and distilled water after incubation were increased from 5.1-6.3 at 0 h to 6.4- > 11  at 24 hr. log cfus of each organism in fmlc and cf-fmlc after incubation with study bacteria for 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr were decreased to undetectable amounts at 24 hr. conclusion: fmlc and cf-fmlc exerted slow inhibitory activity against mdr  bacteria resulting in eradication of all study bacteria at 24 hr. such inhibitory effects were probably due to the products of the milk fermented by lactobacillus  casei strain shirota. clinical study is needed to determine if consumption of fmlc can prevent and treat colonization and infection with mdr bacteria in hospitalized patients.

TI  == probiotic features of two oral lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == in this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum (g1) and l. casei (g3). both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as  staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella abony, and clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of candida albicans. the bacteriocin activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6358-p was shown only by  l. plantarum g1. moreover, the isolates g1 and g3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. the viability of g1 and g3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. the biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated wistar rats, compared to control ones. no toxicity for nmri  ham mice was observed. according to our experimental results, these findings imply that l. plantarum g1 and l. casei g3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
AB  == for dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (listeria innocua, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/g. inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. the inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. in specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by b. animalis against p. aeruginosa and by l. casei against salmonella enteritidis and l. innocua. conversely, the least inhibition was detected for l. casei against p. aeruginosa. our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.

TI  == effect of probiotication on antioxidant and antibacterial activities of pomegranate juices from sour and sweet cultivars.
AB  == there is an increasing interest in using pomegranate juice as a natural antioxidant rather than synthetic compounds. in this study, the antioxidant capacities of probioticated and nonprobioticated aril juices of sweet (swv) and sour (sv) pomegranate cultivars were determined by two different methods: ferric  reducing antioxidant power (frap) and 1,1-diphenyl 2-picrylhydrazyl assay. total  counts of lactobacillus casei gg increased by about 3 log in swv and 2 log in sv  juices after incubation for 48 h. probiotication improved the antioxidant activity of swv juice from 74.4% to 91.82%, and sv juice from 82.64% to 97.8%. based on the frap value, the reducing power of the probioticated pomegranate juices was also much stronger than the nonprobioticated juices. the frap values for swv and sv probioticated juices were 97.34 and 120.7 mmol l(-1), respectively, which were notably higher than 85.87 and 93.4 mmol l(-1) for swv and sv nonprobioticated juices. both fermentated and nonfermentated juices exhibited a potent and wide-spectrum antibacterial effect, with the highest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. sv juice showed wider zones of growth inhibition. the results of this study verify for the first time that probiotication of swv and sv pomegranate juices can add to their beneficial antioxidant activities.

TI  == oral probiotic and prevention of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in intensive care unit patients.
AB  == introduction: preventing carriage of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms from  the aerodigestive tract is an infection control strategy used to reduce the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units. however, antibiotic use in selective decontamination protocols is controversial. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral administration of a probiotic, namely lactobacillus, on gastric and respiratory tract colonization/infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. our hypothesis was that an indigenous flora should exhibit a protective effect against secondary colonization. methods: we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study between march 2003 and october 2004 in a 17-bed intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in clermont-ferrand, france. consecutive patients with a unit stay of longer than 48 hours were included, 106  in the placebo group and 102 in the probiotic group. through a nasogastric feeding tube, patients received either 109 colony-forming units unity forming colony of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus or placebo twice daily, from the third day after admission to discharge. digestive tract carriage of p. aeruginosa was monitored by cultures of gastric aspirates at admission, once a week thereafter and on discharge. in addition, bacteriological analyses of respiratory tract specimens were conducted to determine patient infectious status. results: the occurrence of p. aeruginosa respiratory colonization and/or infection was significantly delayed in the probiotic group, with a difference in median delay to acquisition of 11 days versus 50 days (p = 0.01), and a nonacquisition expectancy mean of 69 days versus 77 days (p = 0.01). the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to p. aeruginosa in the patients receiving the probiotic was less frequent, although not significantly reduced, in patients  in the probiotic group (2.9%) compared with those in the placebo group (7.5%). after multivariate cox proportional hazards modelling, the absence of probiotic treatment increased the risk for p. aeruginosa colonization in respiratory tract  (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.2, 95% confidence interval - 1.1 to 9.1). conclusion:  in this pilot study, oral administration of a probiotic delayed respiratory tract colonization/infection by p. aeruginosa. trial registration: the trial registration number for this study is nct00604110.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  == the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after  treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin  production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated  by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than  200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.

TI  == influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis st34br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  == bacteriocin st34br, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kda produced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis st34br, inhibits the growth of enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. mrs broth, adjusted to ph 6.0 yielded 6,400 au/ml, compared to 400 au/ml recorded in bhi broth, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. at ph of 4.5 only 800 au/ml was produced. based on comparative studies in mrs broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was  identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 au/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 au/ml and 1,600 au/ml, respectively. no difference in bacteriocin st34br activity was recorded in mrs broth supplemented with 2 g/l k2hpo4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or  50 g/l kh2po4. however, 20 g/l kh2po4 increased bacteriocin st34br production to  12,800 au/ml. glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in mrs broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 au/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 au/ml. the presence of cyanocobalamin, l-ascorbic acid, thiamine and dl-6,8-thioctic acid in mrs broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus casei and yogurt administration on prevention of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in young mice.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that rarely causes pulmonary  disease in normal hosts but one that is an important cause of acute pneumonia in  immunocompromised patients, including neonates, and of chronic pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. the aim of this work was to study the effect of oral administration of lactobacillus casei and yogurt on prevention of p. aeruginosa lung infection in young mice (3 weeks old). this study demonstrates that oral administration of l. casei or yogurt to young mice enhanced lung clearance of p. aeruginosa and phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages through a dose-dependent effect. there were, however, no significant differences  in white blood cell (wbc) differential counts. furthermore, it was observed that  previous administration of l. casei or yogurt induced a significant increase in iga and igm levels in bronchoalveolar lavages (bals) after a p. aeruginosa infection, although there was no relationship with the serum values.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB  == endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located  in confined areas of the root canal system. the antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: kerr pulp canal sealer ewt, grossman's sealer, thermaseal, sealer 26, ah plus, and sealer plus. the agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. in the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. the diameters of the formed discs were recorded. all root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. there were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). all root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. statistical analysis of the results revealed that ah plus and kerr pulp canal sealer ewt had flow values  significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.

TI  == enhancement of host resistance to microbial infections in mice fed a high fat diet by lactobacillus casei cells.
AB  == the carbon clearance ability of female ddy mice was markedly reduced by feeding with a high fat-low carbohydrate (hflc) diet for 8 weeks. the reduced clearance ability was restored by a single intraperiotoneal (i.p.) injection with heat-killed lactobacillus casei (yit 9018) cells (lc 9018). the i.p. injection of lc 9018 into the hflc diet-fed mice led to a remarkable enhancement of nonspecific resistance when they were exposed to 50% lethal doses of pseudomonas  aeruginosa or herpes simplex virus, type 1. the resistance-enhancing capacity of  lc 9018 against p. aeruginosa infection was significantly maintained for 7 days after the ip inoculation with lc 9018 in mice fed the hflc diet. the reduced in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (macrophage-rich) from mice fed the hflc diet to p. aeruginosa infection was markedly augmented by the i.p. administration of lc 9018. the results indicate that lc 9018, one of the bacterial immunostimulants, may restore the reduced host defense functions in mice induced by feeding with a high fat diet for a long period.

TI  == the fnr family of transcriptional regulators.
AB  == homologues of the transcriptional regulator fnr from escherichia coli have been identified in a variety of taxonomically diverse bacterial species. despite being structurally very similar, members of the fnr family have disparate regulatory roles. those from shewanella putrefaciens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas stutzeri and rhodopseudomonas palustris are functionally similar to fnr in that they regulate anaerobic respiration or carbon metabolism. four rhizobial proteins (from rhizobium meliloti, r. leguminosarum, b. japonicum and azorhizobium caulinodans) are involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation; a fifth (from rhizobium strain ic3342) has unknown function. two proteins from mammalian pathogens (actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and bordetella pertussis) may be involved in the regulation of toxin expression. the fnr protein of vibrio fischeri regulates bioluminescence, and the function of the one known fnr homologue from a gram-positive organism (lactobacillus casei) remains to be elucidated. some members of this family, like fnr itself, appear to function as sensors of oxygen availability, whereas others do not. the ability to sense and respond to oxygen limitation may be correlated with the presence of cysteine residues which, in the case of fnr, are thought to be involved in oxygen or redox sensing. the mechanism of dna sequence recognition is probably conserved, or very similar, throughout this family. in a number of other gram-negative species, there is good indirect evidence for the existence of fnr analogues; these include alcaligenes eutrophus, a. denitrificans, a. faecalis, paracoccus denitrificans and a number of pseudomonas species.

AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

TI  == augmentation of resistance of mice to bacterial infection by a polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (pspg) extracted from lactobacillus casei.
AB  == a water-soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (pspg) was prepared from heat-killed lactobacillus casei by digesting the bacteria with n-acetylmuramidase. the molecular weight of pspg was over 30,000, and the polysaccharide portion of pspg, its main component was composed of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, glucosamine and galactosamine. mice pretreated intraperitoneally with pspg survived after a lethal infection with listeria monocytogenes or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the growth of infecting bacteria (l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli) in both the peritoneal cavity and the liver was inhibited markedly in the mice that had been treated with pspg. it was suggested that macrophages may be the main effector for the anti-infectious effect of pspg since treatment of mice with carrageenan, a selective macrophage blocker, markedly reduced the anti-infectious effect of pspg.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus casei on pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in normal and  dexamethasone-treated mice.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of lactobacillus casei yit 0003 into normal or dexamethasone-treated mice led to nonspecific resistance against intraperitoneal  challenge with lethal doses of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao 3047. the enhanced resistance was retained for 14 days (p less than 0.05) after injection with living l. casei. in contrast, the statistically significant duration of the enhanced resistance in mice treated intraperitoneally with living l. acidophilus  yit 0075 was only 5 days. the in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (pecs) against p. aeruginosa 5 and 7 days after intraperitoneal injection of living l. casei was significantly higher than in the case of pecs elicited by  l. acidophilus. in the case of intravenous injection of heat-killed l. casei before intraperitoneal challenge with p. aeruginosa, there were no survivors in the late period after administration of l. casei. a high correlation existed between the patterns of in vivo killing of p. aeruginosa by pecs and survival rate of mice injected intravenously with heat-killed l. casei. the reduced in vivo killing activity of pecs from dexamethasone-treated mice against p. aeruginosa infection was also augmented by the intraperitoneal injection of heat-killed l. casei. these results indicate that l. casei possesses a resistance-enhancing capacity against p. aeruginosa infection in vivo. differences in the duration of the enhanced resistance caused by l. casei and by  l. acidophilus may be due to differences in chemical composition and/or physicochemical properties of the cell walls of the two kinds of bacteria.

TI  == prevention of urinary tract infection in rats with an indigenous lactobacillus casei strain.
AB  == our previous studies have shown that indigenous bacteria are able to block the in vitro attachment of uropathogenic bacteria to human uroepithelial cells. in the present study, we applied the concept of competitive exclusion to an animal model. a chronic urinary tract infection was established in female rats with bacteria incorporated into agar beads injected periurethrally into the urinary bladder via a no. 3 french ureteral catheter. five strains of uropathogenic organisms were used in the first set of experiments, and their colonization of the bladder and kidneys of the animals was confirmed up to 2 months after injection. the uropathogens stimulated an immune response, detected by serum antibodies against the uropathogens, and an inflammatory response noted in sections of the kidneys stained with hematoxylin and eosin. using this animal model, we established the persistent adherence of bacteria in the urinary tract without the need for creation of obstruction or implantation of a foreign body. in a second set of experiments, an isolate of lactobacillus casei gr1 taken from  the urethra of a healthy woman was incorporated into agar beads, instilled within the rat bladders on day 1, and then swabbed twice weekly for 21 days onto the introitus before challenge with uropathogens instilled into the urinary bladder.  in 21 of 25 animals, no uropathogenic bacteria were recovered from the bladder and kidney tissues up to 60 days after challenge, and no immune response was detected. our results show that l. casei prevented onset of urinary tract infection in 84% of the animals tested. the lactobacilli appeared to exclude the  uropathogens from colonizing the urinary tract, within the first 48 hours after challenge, and the net effect was a complete eradication of bacteria from the uroepithelium. it is hoped that the demonstration of a protective role for indigenous bacteria in preventing urinary tract infection in an animal model will lead to the application of this technology to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in female patients.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei on pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice.
AB  == the protective effect of heat-killed lactobacillus casei yit9018 (lc 9018) against pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice was compared with that of corynebacterium parvum. survival of mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with p. aeruginosa was augmented in mice that had been pretreated i.p. with lc 9018 5 days previously. similar treatment of mice with c. parvum, however, was not effective at all. moreover, mice became more susceptible to infection with p. aeruginosa after such treatment. growth of p. aeruginosa in the peritoneal cavity and spleen was markedly inhibited in lc 9018-pretreated mice, whereas such inhibition of bacterial growth was not observed in c. parvum-treated mice. the protective effect of lc 9018 was observed in mice subjected to 800 rads of whole  body irradiation but was abrogated when mice were treated with carrageenan. these results suggest that augmentation of the resistance of mice to p. aeruginosa was  caused by the induction of activated macrophages. the number of macrophages detectable in the peritoneal cavity was almost the same in lc 9018- and c. parvum-treated mice. growth of listeria monocytogenes was inhibited by pretreatment with lc 9018. inhibition of l. monocytogenes was also observed after the same pretreatment with c. parvum. it was suggested that macrophages activated with lc 9018 were involved in the protective immunity to p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the effects of temperature and growth rate on the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in bacterial lipids.
AB  == the effects of temperature and growth rate on the fatty acid composition of the extractable lipids of four mesophilic and three psychotrophic bacteria were examined. two of the mesophiles (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their lipids with decreasing temperature over their whole growth temperature range. the other mesophiles (enterobacter aerogenes and lactobacillus casei) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids with decreasing temperature only over the lower half of their growth temperature ranges. the psychrotrophs pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter sp. had a constant proportion of unsaturated acids over the lower half of their growth temperature range, while the psychotrophic lactobacillus sp. showed no consistent change in its unsaturated fatty acid composition with temperature. all species showed some variation of unsaturated fatty acid composition with growth rate at the highest and lowest growth temperatures, although such variations were small in some species (ent. aerogenes and lactobacillus sp.).

TI  == spiral plate method for bacterial determination.
AB  == a method is described for determining the number of bacteria in a solution by the use of a machine which deposits a known volume of sample on a rotating agar plate in an ever decreasing amount in the form of an archimedes spiral. after the sample is incubated, different colony densities are apparent on the surface of the plate. a modified counting grid is described which relates area of the plate  of volume of sample. by counting an appropriate area of the plate, the number of  bacteria in the sample is estimated. this method was compared to the pour plate procedure with the use of pure and mixed cultures in water and milk. the results  did not demonstrate a significant difference in variance between duplicates at the alpha = 0.01 level when concentrations of 600 to 12 x 10(5) bacteria per ml were used, but the spiral plate method gave counts that were higher than counts obtained by the pour plate method. the time and materials required for this method are substantially less than those required for the conventional aerobic pour plate procedure.

TI  == numerical survey of some bacterial taxa.
AB  == focht, d. d. (iowa state university, ames), and w. r. lockhart. numerical survey  of some bacterial taxa. j. bacteriol. 90:1314-1319. 1965.-a numerical analysis was made of 77 properties of each of 43 bacterial strains, representing 25 genera from 8 families in the orders eubacteriales and pseudomonadales. four major groups were found, related to one another at approximately the same level of similarity: (1) a large cluster containing the subgroups (1a) athiorhodaceae-spirillaceae, (1b) xanthomonas, and (1c) "inactive" micrococcaceae-achromobacteraceae; (2) a cluster containing the "active" micrococcaceae and lactobacillaceae; (3) the enterobacteria; and (4) aeromonas. there was a sharp distinction between the branches of groups 1a, 1c, and 2. the composition of groups was essentially the same whether or not fermentation of carbohydrates (28 characters) was included in the analysis. several individual strains, notably, bacillus subtilis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and erwinia amylovora, were related to none of the groups, and others (two species of proteus, flavobacterium devorans, and lactobacillus casei) showed only minimal quantitative relationships with their groups. these results suggest  that there may be significant variation in levels of similarity within microbial  groups presently accorded equivalent taxonomic rank, and that some present distinctions among taxa, particularly at the generic level, cannot be confirmed on the basis of overall similarity.
