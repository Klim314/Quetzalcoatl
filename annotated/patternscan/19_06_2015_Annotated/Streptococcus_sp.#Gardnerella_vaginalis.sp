TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin strictly depends on cholesterol and is potentiated by human cd59.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis produces cytolysin vaginolysin (vly), which has been suggested to be a contributor to bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis. vly along with intermedilysin (ily) from streptococcus intermedius have been attributed to a group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) whose pore-forming activity depends on human cd59 (hcd59). here, we show that different types of cells lacking hcd59 are susceptible to vly-mediated lysis, albeit to different extents. we analyze the effects of both hcd59 and cholesterol on vly cytolytic activity. we show that vly binds to cholesterol-rich membranes of non-human cells, while vly with an impaired cholesterol recognition site retains binding to the hcd59-containing cells. we further demonstrate that cholesterol binding by vly is sufficient to trigger the formation of oligomeric complexes on cholesterol rich-liposomes lacking hcd59. thus, vly may induce cell lysis following two alternative pathways. one requires only cholesterol and does not depend on hcd59. the second pathway involves hcd59 contribution similarly to ily. apparently, under physiological conditions vly acts in the most effective way by accepting the assistance of hcd59.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == human-specific bacterial pore-forming toxins induce programmed necrosis in erythrocytes.
AB  == a subgroup of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) family of pore-forming toxins (pfts) has an unusually narrow host range due to a requirement for binding to human cd59 (hcd59), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-linked complement regulatory molecule. hcd59-specific cdcs are produced by several organisms that inhabit human mucosal surfaces and can act as pathogens, including gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus intermedius. the consequences and potential selective advantages of such pft host limitation have remained unknown. here, we demonstrate that, in addition to species restriction, pft ligation of hcd59 triggers a previously unrecognized pathway for programmed necrosis in primary erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]) from humans and transgenic mice expressing  hcd59. because they lack nuclei and mitochondria, rbcs have typically been thought to possess limited capacity to undergo programmed cell death. rbc programmed necrosis shares key molecular factors with nucleated cell necroptosis, including dependence on fas/fasl signaling and rip1 phosphorylation, necrosome assembly, and restriction by caspase-8. death due to programmed necrosis in rbcs  is executed by acid sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide formation, nadph oxidase- and iron-dependent reactive oxygen species formation, and glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products. bacterial pfts that are hcd59 independent do not induce rbc programmed necrosis. rbc programmed necrosis is biochemically distinct from eryptosis, the only other known programmed cell death pathway in mature rbcs. importantly, rbc programmed necrosis enhances the growth of pft-producing pathogens during exposure to primary rbcs, consistent with a role for such signaling in microbial growth and pathogenesis. importance: in this work, we provide the first description of a new form of programmed cell death in erythrocytes (rbcs) that occurs as a consequence of cellular attack by human-specific bacterial toxins. by defining a new rbc death pathway that shares  important components with necroptosis, a programmed necrosis module that occurs in nucleated cells, these findings expand our understanding of rbc biology and rbc-pathogen interactions. in addition, our work provides a link between cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) host restriction and promotion of bacterial growth in the presence of rbcs, which may provide a selective advantage to human-associated bacterial strains that elaborate such toxins and a potential explanation for the narrowing of host range observed in this toxin family.

TI  == silver sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  == this in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing iasos (silsos femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. in bhi and lapt culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different phs were tested. iasos exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. the results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced iasos efficacy only to a moderate extent. whereas comparable mbcs (minimal bactericidal concentrations) were observed for g. vaginalis (10 mg/l ag+), e. coli and e. aerogenes (25 mg/l ag+) in both media, higher mbcs were found for s. aureus and s. agalactiae in lapt cultures (50 mg/l ag+ versus 25 mg/l ag+). no minimal concentration totally  inhibiting the growth of c. albicans was found. nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/l ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in candida growth was observed. ph differently affected the antimicrobial properties of iasos against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at ph higher than the physiological ph was generally observed. it can be therefore concluded that iasos exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against c. albicans. the antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel silsos femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of iasos. overall, our findings support iasos as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.

TI  == vaginal infections among pregnant women at omdurman maternity hospital in khartoum, sudan.
AB  == introduction: microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. this study  aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. methodology: a cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between august and december 2008 at omdurman maternity hospital, khartoum, sudan. vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct gram smear, nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. statistical analysis was done using spss program version 12.0.1. a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically  significant. results: of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, bv was detected in 49.8%, followed by chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). no significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and c. trachomatis infections was found. gentamicin was the most active agent against gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. clarythromycin was the most active against mycoplasma species. conclusions: pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. such cases may require specific medication. routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.

TI  == the diversity of receptor recognition in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are bacterial pore-forming toxins secreted mainly by pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. cdcs generally recognize and bind to membrane cholesterol to create pores and lyse target cells. however,  in contrast to typical cdcs such as streptolysin o, several atypical cdcs have been reported. the first of these was intermedilysin, which is secreted by streptococcus intermedius and has human cell-specificity, human cd59 (hucd59) being its receptor. in the study reported here, the diversity of receptor recognition among cdcs was investigated and multi-receptor recognition characteristics were identified within this toxin family. streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) secreted by s. mitis strain nm-65 isolated from a patient with kawasaki disease was previously shown to hemolyze erythrocytes in a species-dependent manner, its maximum activity being in human cells. in the present study, it was found that sm-hpaf recognizes  both membrane cholesterol and hucd59 as receptors for triggering pore-formation.  moreover, vaginolysin (vly) of gardnerella vaginalis showed similar characteristics to sm-hpaf regarding receptor recognition. on the basis of the results presented here, the mode of receptor recognition of cdcs can be categorized into the following three groups: (i) group i, comprising typical cdcs with high affinity to cholesterol and no or very little affinity to hucd59; (ii)  group ii, including atypical cdcs such as ily, with no or very little affinity to cholesterol and high affinity to hucd59; and (iii) group iii, which contains atypical cdcs such as sm-hpaf and vly with affinity to both cholesterol and hucd59.

TI  == tissue-specific il-10 secretion profile from term human fetal membranes stimulated with pathogenic microorganisms associated with preterm labor in a two-compartment tissue culture system.
AB  == objective: interleukin (il)-10 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties that plays pivotal roles in immune recognition and maintenance of pregnancy, limiting the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory modulators. the aim of this work was to characterize the contribution of amnion and choriodecidua regions of the human fetal membranes in the production of il-10 after selective stimulation with candida albicans, gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus agalactiae. methods: pre-labor human fetal membranes were cultured in a two-compartment tissue culture system and stimulated with 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of each pathogen added to either the  amniotic or choriodecidual region or both. results: candida albicans and g. vaginalis were the pathogens most effective in inducing il-10 secretion, increasing 20 and 10 times, respectively, the levels of this cytokine in the choriodecidual compartment. stimulation with s. agalactiae was effective only in  the choriodecidual region, increasing two times il-10 concentration. conclusions: synthesis and secretion of il-10 in response to three different pathogens associated with intrauterine infection and preterm birth are differential and depend on the nature of the microorganism and initial contact region.

TI  == bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern poland.
AB  == objectives: the objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of  an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. material and methods: the study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already  given birth to healthy children. the material for the presence of c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, m. genitalium, m. hominis and u. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by pcr. furthermore, bd probetec et system was used to detect c. trachomatis infection. vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. results: u. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of  controls. presence of m. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and c.  trachomatis only in latter (3%). n. gonorrhoeae and m. genitalium were not found  in any of the examined women. the frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. there were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). conclusions: despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. bv develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.

TI  == profiles of ily, vly and sm-hpaf interaction with human cd59.
AB  == background: the molecular features of a new member of the bacterially -derived cytolysin family were examined. in particular, the interactive mechanisms of intermedilysin (ily), vaginolysin (vly), and streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) with human cd59 (hcd59) were analyzed. materials and methods: molecular models of vly and sm-hpaf were constructed based on x-ray data of ily (protein data bank id=1s3r), and their interactive profiles  with hcd59 were examined using molecular simulation. results: non-binding (nb) energy between ily and hcd59 was three orders of magnitude higher than the energy between vly and hcd59. nb energy between sm-hpaf and hcd59 was similar to that between vly and hcd59. conclusion: a hydrogen bond (ily arg432-hcd59 glu76) was observed between ily and hcd59, and a stronger interaction was formed by flexible adjustment between them.

TI  == [vaginal infections in pregnant women at the regional hospital of sokode (togo) in 2010 and 2011].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the major microorganisms causing vaginal infections in pregnant women consulting at the regional hospital of sokode and to assess their sensitivity to antibiotics. materials and methods: this prospective study took place from june 2010 through august 2011 and included 302 pregnant women from whom a sample was taken by a vaginal swab. samples were processed for parasitic, bacterial, and fungal agents, by microscopic examination and culture. results: we isolated 273 germs, alone or  in association in 221 women. these germs were distributed as follows: gardnerella vaginalis (55.31%), candida spp (30.77%), staphylococcus aureus (5.49%), enterobacteriaceae (4.40%), trichomonas vaginalis (3.66%) and mobiluncus spp (0.37%). no streptococcus strain was isolated during the study. over 40% of women had bacterial vaginosis and 23.08% of them were coinfected. the occurrence of coinfection was statistically influenced by the stage of pregnancy (p = 0.05). the susceptibility tests revealed that s. aureus developed a strong resistance to aminopenicillins (66.67%) and cephalosporins (>44.44%), while enterobacteriaceae  was resistant to cephalosporins and quinolones. (16.67%). conclusion: this study  showed that pregnant women in sokode are still exposed to vaginal infection, caused mostly by g. vaginalis and candida species. these results underline the need for at least one vaginal swab culture for each woman during pregnancy.

TI  == a deeper analysis of the epitope/paratope of ply-5, a mouse monoclonal antibody which recognises the conserved undecapeptide tryptophan-rich loop (ectglawewwr) of bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == a previous study showed that the minimal epitope recognised by the ply-5 mab in the conserved undecapeptide trp-rich loop of bacterial cdcs should consist of wewwrt (jacobs et al., 1999) [5]. now, through immunoscreening of amino acid substitution analogues, it is concluded that the second trp and the arg residues  are essential in the ply-5 epitope. the e residue is an auxiliary epitope contributor. antibody modelling and docking simulations provided support for these findings. for recognition by the antibody, the trp-rich loop flipped out, mimicking the mechanism of membrane insertion. the displaced second trp was seen  to establish aromatic stacking interactions with aromatic residues of the antibody paratope and the notably extruded guanidium tip of the arginine residue  mediated electrostatic interactions with well-exposed carboxylic groups of glutamic residues on the surface of the paratope. thus, the epitope/paratope interaction is mainly mediated by aromatic and by ionic interactions.

TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane toll-like receptor expression.
AB  == problem: preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pprom) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (ptb) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection  and inflammation. the membranes may sense and respond to microbes via toll-like receptors (tlrs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation  in this tissue. the objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of tlrs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and ptb. method of study: normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. after 24 hrs, rna was extracted and quantitative rt-pcr performed for tlrs1-10. results: treatment of fetal membranes with mycoplasma hominis increased expression of tlr4, tlr6, and tlr8 mrna. ureaplasma parvum upregulated tlr8 mrna, and porphyromonas gingivalis  significantly increased fetal membrane tlr7 expression. in contrast, treatment with gram-negative escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated tlr10 mrna. no effect was detected for ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, or group b streptococcus. conclusion: these findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane tlr expression patterns. moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pprom and ptb, arise.

TI  == [possible role of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  == vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. it is due to several causes, some even unknown. bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. they have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. the identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. in 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, candida albicans, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and streptococcus agalactiae. b. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. these strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees  c in anaerobe chambers. supernatant activity was assayed in ht-29 cells. eighteen b. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. it was not identified in healthy women (p < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. this fact suggests that enterotoxigenic b. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. the effect of enterotoxin on e-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. this is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.

TI  == characterization of low molecular weight antimicrobial peptide from human female  reproductive tract.
AB  == background & objectives: the mechanisms that protect female upper genital tract from ascending infection by microbes present in vagina are only partially understood. it is expected that epithelial cells in mucosal surfaces and their secretions directly interfere with microbial colonization and invasion. this study was aimed to demonstrate the expression of 2 kda antimicrobial peptide which was identified and purified from female genital tract tissues using chromatographic techniques. methods: low molecular weight proteins were isolated  from human female reproductive tract tissues obtained from premenopausal women. antimicrobial activity of these lmw proteins was assessed against different reproductive tract pathogens viz., neisseria gonorrhoeae, group b streptococcus,  gardnerella vaginalis, escherechia coli and candida albicans. the expression of these peptides were also documented in reproductive tract tissues with the help of hyperimmune sera raised against the rabbits. the purified peptide was characterized by n-terminal sequencing. results: immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that 2 kda peptide was expressed in the stratified squamous epithelial cells of the ectocervix while it was absent in columnar epithelial cells of upper genital tract. upregulation of the expression  of this peptide was observed in patients of chronic non-specific cervicitis and acute on chronic cervicitis. this purified antimicrobial peptide also showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against different reproductive tract pathogens. interpretation & conclusions: considering the emerging bacterial resistance against conventional antibiotics, isolation and understanding of the expression of antimicrobial peptides from female reproductive tissue extracts may provide some leads towards the development of strategies for the treatment of reproductive tract infections.

TI  == [the role of infection in preterm birth].
AB  == intrauterine infection could be responsible for 25% up to 40% of preterm births.  this relationship was initially demonstrated using animal models, inducing their  abortion by injecting bacteria or endotoxins. in human research, examination of amniocentesis fluid showed the anteriority of infection over labor induction, and the existence of a subclinical latency phase between these two phenomena. the ascending route is preponderant, and four stages can be distinguished: cervical and vaginal infection, chorio-decidual infection, intra-amniotic infection, fetal infection. the intrauterine infection is very frequent in case of early preterm birth (<30 wg). it is associated with an increase of neurological and pulmonary morbidity. most commonly found bacterial species are mycoplasma species, but also escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus b. several markers of the infection have been studied: a maternal leukocytosis>15,000/mm(3) or a c-reactive protein (crp)>20mg/l, an increase of fibronectin and/or il-6 cervical, a short cervical length especially before 32 wg, a leukocytosis of the amniotic fluid, and/or high interleukin concentrations. the main marker used for the newborn is the crp, but other markers can also be used for an early diagnosis of  an infection, especially interleukin 6.

TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == inerolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by lactobacillus iners.
AB  == lactobacillus iners is a common constituent of the human vaginal microbiota. this species was only recently characterized due to its fastidious growth requirements and has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. here we present the identification and molecular characterization of a protein toxin produced by l. iners. the l. iners genome encodes an open reading frame with significant primary sequence similarity to intermedilysin (ily; 69.2%  similarity) and vaginolysin (vly; 68.4% similarity), the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from streptococcus intermedius and gardnerella vaginalis, respectively. clinical isolates of l. iners produce this protein, inerolysin (iny), during growth in vitro, as assessed by western analysis. iny is a pore-forming toxin that is activated by reducing agents and inhibited by excess cholesterol. it is active across a ph range of 4.5 to 6.0 but is inactive at ph 7.4. at sublytic concentrations, iny activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and allows entry of fluorescent phalloidin into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. unlike vly and ily, which are human specific, iny is active against cells from a broad range of species. iny represents a new target for studies directed at understanding the role of l. iners in states of health and disease at the vaginal mucosal surface.

TI  == detection of sexually transmitted infection and human papillomavirus in negative  cytology by multiplex-pcr.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (hpv) and 15 species that cause sexually transmitted infections (stis) in negative cytology. in addition, we compared the diagnostic performance  of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with widely available techniques used to detect hpv. methods: we recruited 235 women of reproductive age who had negative cytology findings in a liquid-based cervical smear. stis were identified by multiplex pcr, and hpv genotypes by multiplex pcr, hybrid capture 2, and dna microaray; discordant results were analyzed by direct sequencing. results: approximately 96.6% of patients with negative cytology results were positive for  pathogens that cause stis. the pathogens most frequently detected were gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum. the incidence of hpv in negative cytology was 23.3%. low-risk hpv infection was significantly correlated with chalmaydia trachomatis, and high-risk hpv infection was significantly correlated  with group beta streptococcus. the analytical sensitivities of the multiplex pcr  and dna microarray were higher than 80%, and the analytical specificity was nearly 100% for all tests. conclusions: multiplex pcr yielded results that most of patients with negative cytology were positive for pathogens that cause stis, and were more similar to that of dna microarray, than that of hybrid capture 2 in terms of analytical sensitivity and prediction value of hpv infection.

TI  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. the activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. an overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of cdcs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. the way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (macpf) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. in this chapter i aim to provide an overview  of our understanding of the interaction between cdcs and other members of what is now called the macpf/cdc superfamily, with their target membranes. cdcs (also in  the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four gram-positive bacterial genera (clostridium, listeria, bacillus and streptococcus). well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. listeriolysin from l. monocytogenes  is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. perfringolysin from c. perfringens (fig. 1a) has become perhaps the most studied cdc4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). streptolysin from s. pyogenes is another intensely studied cdc and has been applied widely in  experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for s. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. however, cdcs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria arcanobacterium pyogenes and gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. the homology with the macpf family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic macpf/cdc fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (fig. 1a and d). without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. the glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that cdcs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. while not all macpf domains are involved in pore formation-for example, c6 and c8beta--they are all apparently involved in action  on membranes. the dramatic refolding undergone by cdcs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the macpf/cdc domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (fig. 1a-c). it is obviously the basic assumption that  where noncdc members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 even where a member of the macpf/cdc superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. however, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another macpf/cdc family member or members from the same specific system. complement acts by a combination of the c5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting c9 to form a lesion, which may be a  complete ring of c9 associated with the c5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.

TI  == efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == objective: we assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (bv) prevention. study design: one hundred twenty healthy chinese women with a history of recurrent bv were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (probaclac vaginal; nicar laboratories,  inc, blainville, quebec, canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days  on. results: probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for bv (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; p < .001) and gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; p = .02). between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of bv and g vaginalis. aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. conclusion: short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces bv recurrence and  g vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.

TI  == gardnerella, trichomonas vaginalis, candida, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. the data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyiticum and chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. in the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), candida species (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). the genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), enterobacteriaceae or enterococci (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). the reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates  in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation  of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of enterobacteriaceae and enterococci. lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (gardnerella vaginalis, enterobacteriaceae  and enterococci, streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.

TI  == [evaluation of microbiological diagnostics in urogenital infections in postmenopausal women].
AB  == objective: to establish the percentage of infections in postmenopausal women with urinary symptoms which can be confirmed by microbiological analysis, the most common causative agents and whether the urethra and vagina in patients with cystitis are concurrently colonized by pathogenic microorganisms. methods: laboratories of the croatian national institute of public health in zagreb, in the period of two years, analyzed 245 samples taken from patients with urinary symptoms who had been postmenopausal at least for a year. urine samples, as well  as urethral and vaginal swabs were taken from each patient and tested for causative agents of urogenital infections, genital mycoplasma and chlamydia trachomatis. results: cystitis was confirmed by microbiological analysis in 31.4% women, urethritis in 24.8%, and vaginitis in 15.1%. the most common causative agent of urethritis was ureaplasma urealyticum, while gardnerella vaginalis was the most common in vaginal infections. e. coli was concurrently isolated in urine, urethral and vaginal samples in 65.1% of patients with e. coli cystitis, while streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in urethral and vaginal samples in each patient with streptococcus agalactiae cystitis. conclusion: mucosal colonization of the urethra and vagina contributes to the incidence of cystitis in postmenopausal women. microbiological diagnostics is necessary to distinguish  between the symptoms of ageing of the urogenital system and infection, with a view to preventing unnecessary antibiotic therapy.

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == functional and phylogenetic characterization of vaginolysin, the human-specific cytolysin from gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == pore-forming toxins are essential to the virulence of a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) and its significant adverse sequelae, including preterm  birth and acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus. g. vaginalis makes a protein toxin that generates host immune responses and has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of bv. we demonstrate that g. vaginalis produces  a toxin (vaginolysin [vly]) that is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) family, most closely related to intermedilysin from streptococcus intermedius. consistent with this predicted relationship, vly lyses target cells  in a species-specific manner, dependent upon the complement regulatory molecule cd59. in addition to causing erythrocyte lysis, vly activates the conserved epithelial p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and induces interleukin-8 production by human epithelial cells. transfection of human cd59 into nonsusceptible cells renders them sensitive to vly-mediated lysis. in addition, a single amino acid substitution in the vly undecapeptide [vly(p480w)] generates a  toxoid that does not form pores, and introduction of the analogous proline residue into another cdc, pneumolysin, significantly decreases its cytolytic activity. further investigation of the mechanism of action of vly may improve understanding of the functions of the cdc family as well as diagnosis and therapy for bv.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == isolation of the bacillus subtilis antimicrobial peptide subtilosin from the dairy product-derived bacillus amyloliquefaciens.
AB  == aims: to purify and characterize an antimicrobial protein (bacteriocin) isolated  from the dairy product-derived bacillus amyloliquefaciens. methods and results: an unknown bacterial species cultured from the yogu farm probiotic dairy beverage was identified through 16s ribosomal rna analysis as b. amyloliquefaciens, a phylogenetically close relative of bacillus subtilis. the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of overnight cultures was active against listeria monocytogenes and also against clinical isolates of gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus agalactiae.  at the same time, several isolates of vaginal probiotic lactobacilli were resistant to the cfs. the nature of the compound causing inhibitory activity was  confirmed as proteinaceous by enzymatic digestion. the protein was isolated using ammonium sulfate precipitation, and further purified via column chromatography. pcr analysis was conducted to determine relatedness to other bacteriocins produced by bacillus spp. conclusion: the antimicrobial protein isolated from b.  amyloliquefaciens was shown to be subtilosin, a bacteriocin previously reported as produced only by b. subtilis. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report of intra-species horizontal gene transfer for subtilosin and the first fully characterized bacteriocin isolated from b. amyloliquefaciens. finally, this is the first report on subtilosin's activity against bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens.

AB  == objective: previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. the aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. methods: data were collected from 1996 to 2006. medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range  1-16, sd 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. spss software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. results: only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. sexually transmitted diseases were documented: gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and hiv 0 (0%, 27 tested). bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), streptococcus group b 8 (6.6%),  staphylococcus koag neg. 37 (30.6%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), bacteroides 19 (15.7%), prevotella 24 (19.8%), klebsiella 4  (3.3%), corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). conclusions: sexually  transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms  (except for bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.

TI  == etiologic agents of cervicovaginitis in turkish women.
AB  == objective: to investigate the distribution of microbiologic agents causing cervicovaginitis. methods: we conducted the study between october 2002 and december 2004 in abant izzet baysal university, duzce school of medicine hospital, turkey. the samples were obtained from the posterior vaginal fornix and cervix by swabs in 828 patients. direct microscopic examination, culture and enzyme immune assay (eia) methods were performed in all patients for diagnosis of microbiologic agents. results: gardnerella vaginalis (g. vaginalis) were diagnosed in 254 (30.7%) patients, candida albicans (c. albicans) in 152 (18.4%), candida glabrata (c. glabrata) in 36 (4.3%), candida species in 52 (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) in 62 (7.5%), streptococcus group b in 28 (3.4%), escherichia coli (e. coli) in 42 (5.1%), klebsiella species in 24 (2.9%), and streptococcus group d in 8 (1%) patients in culture. less frequent enterobacteria in 30 (3.6%) were: pseudomonas species, proteus species enterobacter species, hafnia alvei and nonfermenter species. neisseria gonorrheae (n. gonorrheae) was detected in one patient (0.1%) in culture. the chlamydia trachomatis (c. trachomatis) antigen was detected by eia methods in 130 (15.7%) patients and trichomonas vaginalis (t. vaginalis) was observed in 8 (1%) patients by direct microscopic examination. conclusion: performing the etiologic diagnosis of cervicovaginitis is necessary in order to take appropriate therapeutic and preventive measures. therefore, we recommend g. vaginalis, c. albicans and c. trachomatis should be investigated in patients having a diagnosis of cervicovaginitis in our population, since these were detected in a considerable number of cases. additionally, c. glabrata and t. vaginalis should be kept in mind as possible pathogens.

TI  == bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  == the physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. this prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and/or u. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) ccu ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. in standard aerobic cultures, gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered,  high (> or =10(4) ccu ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) ccu ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. this study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of u. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for u. urealyticum should be raised to >  or =10(4) cfu ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before  any treatment.

TI  == comparison between gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade i microflora and  revised categorization of grade i microflora.
AB  == background: the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on gram stained slides of vaginal smears. ison and  hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the streptococcus cell type. because in the nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a  final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the gram stain. to this purpose we compared gram stain based  categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific pcr for the detection of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae and with ii) tdna-pcr for the identification of most cultivable species. results: a total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade  i microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade ii, 22 (4.3%) as grade iii and 8 (1.6%) as grade iv, according to the criteria of ison and hay. another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade i-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. we found that 52.7% of the grade i-like samples contained bifidobacterium spp. while l. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade ii specimens.based on the presence of different lactobacillus cell types, grade i specimens were further characterized as grade ia (40.2%), grade iab (14.9%) and grade ib (44.9%). we found that this classification was supported by the finding  that l. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade ia and  iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade ib specimens, a category in which l. gasseri and l. iners were predominant. conclusion: further refinement of gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade i smears (ia, iab and ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade i-like. a strong correlation was found between grade ia and the presence of l. crispatus and between grade i-like  and the presence of bifidobacteria. this refinement of gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.

TI  == symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis in heterosexual men: a case control study.
AB  == objective: to determine microbial and behavioural factors contributing to non-gonococcal urethral symptoms in men. methods: case-control study of heterosexual men with non-gonococcal urethral symptoms (cases) and without urethral symptoms (controls) attending melbourne sexual health centre, australia. sexual behaviour and condom use were measured by questionnaire. first stream urine was tested for potential pathogens: chlamydia trachomatis (ligase chain reaction), mycoplasma genitalium (polymerase chain reaction, pcr), ureaplasma urealyticum (culture and pcr), and streptococcus spp, gardnerella vaginalis, and  haemophilus species (culture). urethral smears from cases were examined for polymorphonuclear leucocytes. results: 80 cases and 79 controls were recruited over 4 months in 2002-3. 49 cases (61%) had urethritis by microscopic criteria, 17 (21%) had chlamydia trachomatis (adjusted odds ratio (or) 27 (95% confidence interval (ci): 3.4 to 222)), five (6%) had mycoplasma genitalium (or 6.1 (95% ci: 0.6 to 61)), and 11 (14%) had gardnerella vaginalis (or 9.0 (95% ci: 1.6 to 52)). other organisms were not significantly associated with urethral symptoms. the presence of urethritis on urethral smear did not predict the presence of chlamydia trachomatis (or 1.7 (95% ci: 0.5 to 5.4)). urethral symptoms were significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex with more than one casual partner (or 9.3 (95% ci: 1.3 to 65)) and unprotected anal sex with a regular partner in the past month (or 3.5 (95% ci: 1.0 to 13)). conclusion: gardnerella vaginalis and unprotected anal sex may cause symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis. microscopy of the urethral smear to diagnose urethritis in this population does not help to identify which men with urethral symptoms require treatment for chlamydia.

TI  == [study of acute vulvovaginitis in sexually active adult women, with special reference to candidosis, in patients of the francisco j. muniz infectious diseases hospital].
AB  == the results of microbiological vaginal secretions samples obtained from 749 women (from july 2001 to july 2002) were studied in the bacteriology unit of the francisco javier muniz hospital from buenos aires. all patients suffered acute vulvovaginitis were child bearing and sexually active women, 334 of them were hiv-positive. the following are the results of the microbiological studies: lactobacillus spp 50.6%, gardnerella vaginalis 25.6%, candida spp 17.4%, trichomonas vaginalis 5.3%, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.3% and b group streptococcus  0.8%. candida vaginitis was significantly more frequent in hiv-positive patients, (21.6% vs 14%; p = 0.0086); meanwhile, trichomoniasis was less common although the difference was not statistically significant (3.6 vs 6.7%, p = 0.0810). the following candida species were isolated in this study: candida albicans 76.8%, candida glabrata 15.6%, candida parapsilosis 2.9%, candida tropicalis 1.5% and candida krusei 0.7%. eight cases (6.2%) of vaginitis were produced by two candida species (c. albicans and c. glabrata), and in three cases (2.17%) saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated. five women suffering acute vaginitis with candida spp presented another etiologic agent of vaginal infection, three cases t. vaginalis  and two cases g. vaginalis. the following are some of the most important findings of this study: 1) half of the patients presented a normal microbial biota; 2) candida spp vaginitis was significantly more frequent among hiv-positive women; 3) we observed a high incidence of candida glabrata infections (15.9%), 4) 6.2% of vaginal candidiasis were caused by more than one candida species and, 5) the susceptibility pattern of c. albicans and c. glabrata isolates against fluconazole was similar to the one observed in other studies. the majority of c.  albicans isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (mic90 = 0.5 microg/ml) meanwhile c. glabrata strains were much less susceptible to this drug (mic50 and  mic90 = 32 microg/ml).

TI  == [clinical relevance of antibiotic resistance in obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == antibiotic resistance of microorganisms that cause infections of the urogenital tract is a clinically relevant problem in obstetrics and gynecology. due to methodological difficulties, resistance testing is rarely used for the management of these infections. therefore, solid epidemiological data on resistance rates of most involved pathogens are scarce. antibiotic resistance of several microorganisms appears to be increasing in various areas of the world, mainly trichomonas vaginalis and gardnerella vaginalis (metronidazole),streptococcus agalactiae (macrolides, clindamycin), mycoplasma hominis (tetracyclines, intrinsically macrolide resistant). in addition,isolated cases of clinical infections caused by multi-resistant chlamydia trachomatis have been reported. the presence of antibiotic resistance should therefore be considered in patients  with an unfavorable course despite adequate antibiotic therapy. in light of the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the large gaps in our knowledge in this particular area, research efforts in the field of anti-biotic resistance in  gynecological infections should be markedly intensified.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == [abnormal bacterial colonisation of the vagina and implantation during assisted reproduction].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficiency of our treatment of vaginal infection for couples included in an ivf program. patients and methods: microbiologic screening of vaginal flora and semen has been performed one month prior to in vitro fertilization for 951 couples in 2000. antibiotic treatment was prescribed in case of positive culture. results: positive microbial growths were observed from  endocervical and vaginal cultures in 218 women (22.9%). the clinical pregnancy rate was 30.29% in the group of patients without growth and 30.27% in the group with positive microbial growth. the implantation rate was significantly diminished in case of bacterial growth: 14.6 compared to 19.3% (p <0.02) for sterile endocervical culture. five main bacterial species were found at the cervical level: candida albicans (69 cases), ureaplasma urealyticum (49 cases), gardnerella vaginalis (43 cases), streptococcus b or d (24 cases) and escherichia coli (22 cases). positive cultures from both vagina and semen were observed for 77 couples whose clinical pregnancy rate was 19.5 vs 36.2% in case of vaginal infection alone (p <0.01) with a spontaneous miscarriage rate of 46.7 compared to 17.6% (p <0.01). discussion and conclusion: endocervical microorganisms, even treated with adapted antibiotics, may affect embryonic implantation. positive culture from both female and male partner may enhance this negative effect. in this case, the best strategy would be to cancel the ivf treatment.

TI  == culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  == renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. in this study, a culture-independent 16s rrna-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. similarly sized amplicons encompassing the v6 to v8 region of the 16s rrna were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) (wave system). artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. we evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and dhplc  generated peak profiles. however, for culture-negative specimens, dhplc facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. dna sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. thus, in pcr-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as corynebacterium urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including anaerococcus lactolyticus, bacteroides vulgatus, dialister invisus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus iners, leptotrichia amnionii, prevotella buccalis, prevotella ruminicola, rahnella aquatilis, and streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. the method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both dhplc-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. a detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.

AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. the participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of uti; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. to gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis and streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in uti. methods: a total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low uti were analyzed. samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and mcconkey agar, as well as hbt medium for g. vaginalis, and u9b broth and agar e broth for m. hominis and u. urealyticum. the following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. results. there were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. microorganisms  associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): g. vaginalis (25.7%), u. urealyticum (5.9%), s. agalactiae (3.4%) and m. hominis (2%). uti were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and  in diabetic patients. conclusions: microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the  need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of uti.

TI  == [retrospective microbiologic evaluation of vaginal cultures].
AB  == vaginal culture is one of the most difficult cultures to be evaluated in clinical microbiology practice. the necessity of some expensive and complicated processes  for diagnosis of some specific agents, age related variability of normal vaginal  flora and failure caused by temporary presence of some pathogens in normal flora  can be listed among the probable causes of that problem. in this study 8050 vaginal cultures performed in our hospital laboratories between 1 march 1999-15 september 2001 were evaluated retrospectively. it was shown that the most frequently isolated pathogens were yeasts belonging to the candida genus (26.8%). the second most frequent pathogen (13.8%) was gardnerella vaginalis which was an  indicator of bacterial vaginosis. the rate of isolation of trichomonas vaginalis  was 2.2%. group b streptococcus (gbs) was isolated in 2.0% of the total cultures. some nonspecific bacteria, mainly gram negative bacilli, were noted as colonizing agents (6.5%).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dequalinium chloride against leading germs of vaginal infections.
AB  == dequalinium chloride (cas 522-51-0) and povidone iodine (cas 25655-41-8) are known as antiseptic agents and used in the local treatment of vaginal infections. clotrimazole (cas 23593-75-1) is an anti-fungal drug and applied primarily in the therapy of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and to a lesser extent in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. however, antimicrobial activities of those three agents in comparison to each other have not been reported so far. to address this issue the antimicrobial activities of these agents against 18 germs relevant to vaginal infections were determined. the tested species are representatives of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, listeria, escherichia, proteus, gardnerella, bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, candida, and trichomonas. all micro-organisms were susceptible to dequalinium chloride with the exception of proteus mirabilis. at a given dose, the activity of dequalinium  chloride was higher as compared to the other substances. in view of its wide antimicrobial spectrum dequalinium chloride is an efficient alternative in the local therapy of vaginal infections such as fluor vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis, vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis.

AB  == the microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. as expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). enterobacteriaceae, mainly escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of  vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. candida albicans was present in 10% of  healthy pregnant woman assayed. streptoccocci (streptococcus sp. and enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci beta-hemolytic, gbs) was detected in 7% of the samples. gbs infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. furthermore, gbs was often co-isolated with c. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. a complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as gbs, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.

TI  == definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == objective: to define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. design: observational study. setting: university hospital gasthuisberg, leuven, belgium. sample: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. methods: samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). results: genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. conclusion: aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group b streptococci and e. coli. its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. the most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. in theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora isolated from the female genital tract  activates hiv-1 expression.
AB  == alteration of cervicovaginal microbial flora can lead to vaginosis, which is associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 transmission. we recently characterized a soluble hiv-inducing factor (hif) from the cervicovaginal lavage  (cvl) samples of women. the goals of this study were to determine the effect of cervicovaginal microflora on hiv-1 expression and to elucidate the relationship between hif activity and microflora. physiologically relevant microorganisms, mycoplasma, diphtheroid-like bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus constellatus, cultured from the cvl of a representative woman with a clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis and possessing hif activity, induced hiv-1 expression. the magnitude of virus induction varied widely with the greatest stimulation induced by diphtheroid-like bacteria and mycoplasma. the transcriptional induction by mycoplasma was mediated by activation of the kb enhancer, an activation mechanism shared with hif. also as with hif, mycoplasma induced ap-1 dependent transcription. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based speciation showed that the isolate was m. hominis. our data  indicate that bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora can enhance hiv-1 transcription and replication and identify m. hominis as a potential source for hif activity. the virus-enhancing activities associated with the microflora and hif may increase genital tract viral load, potentially contributing to hiv transmission.

TI  == assessment of office-based care of sexually transmitted diseases and vaginitis and antibiotic decision-making by obstetrician-gynecologists.
AB  == objective: survey office-based obstetric-gynecologic practitioners regarding their knowledge of infectious disease care and antibiotic use. methods: a survey  questionnaire of multiple-choice questions was mailed to fellows of the american  college of obstetricians and gynecologists about clinical entities for which recommendations have undergone recent changes or about which there was a lack of  consensus in a prior similar survey (gibbs rs, mcgregor ja, mead pb, et al.: obstet gynecol 83:631-636, 1994). results: respondents indicated that oral metronidazole was their most frequent choice to treat bacterial vaginosis. ampicillin (57%) was used more often than penicillin (39%) for intrapartum group  b streptococcus prophylaxis. azithromycin was preferred (61%) over erythromycin-base (38%) for chlamydia treatment during pregnancy. there were several modes of practice that deviated from accepted care: 27% and 29% did not screen for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively, in pregnancy; 17% used cultures for gardnerella vaginalis to diagnose bacterial vaginosis; 25% considered quinolones to be safe in pregnancy; 93% felt metronidazole should never be used in pregnancy; and the majority (66%) would send a patient treated successfully for pelvic cellulitis home with an oral antibiotic. conclusion: respondents' infectious disease knowledge and practices in obstetrics and gynecology is appropriate in treating sexually transmitted diseases, bacterial vaginosis, and group b streptococcus. numerous deficiencies still exist in screening for sexually transmitted diseases in pregnancy and diagnosing bacterial vaginosis, as well as in the choice of antibiotics to use or avoid for certain infections.

TI  == relationship between maternal group b streptococcal colonization and pregnancy outcome.
AB  == objective: to examine the association of maternal colonization with group b streptococcus (gbs) with preterm labor and premature rupture of the membranes (prom). methods: vaginal cultures were conducted in 615 women at 22-26 weeks' gestation and again on admission for term delivery, preterm labor, or prom. antibiotics were not given antenatally based on a gbs-positive culture result. fisher exact test and maximum likelihood analysis were used for statistical analysis. results: the rates of preterm labor and prom were not significantly different between gbs-positive and gbs-negative women in both the antenatal screening and the screening on admission. according to maximum-likelihood analyses, the known risk factors for preterm labor and prom collectively were important risk factors for preterm labor (odds ratio: 6.48), but gbs colonization during pregnancy was not a risk factor for preterm labor or prom. in the antenatal screening, the proportion of subjects with lactobacilli-reduced vaginal flora was significantly higher in gbs-positive women (14.3%; ten of 70) than in gbs-negative women (6.4%; 35 of 545) (p = 0.26). bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes) were isolated in only 3.7% (23 of 615) of all subjects. conclusion: vaginal colonization with gbs was not associated with preterm labor and prom in an obstetric population with a low  incidence of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, despite the presence of lactobacilli-reduced flora in gbs-positive women.

TI  == streptococcus agalactiae: a vaginal pathogen?
AB  == the significance of streptococcus agalactiae as an aetiological agent in vaginitis was evaluated. a total of 6226 samples from women who presented with vaginal symptoms was examined. the presence of >10 leucocytes/high-power field (h.p.f.) was taken to be the criterion of active infection. s. agalactiae was isolated from 10.1% of these samples. the isolation rates of other common pathogens such as candida spp., gardnerella vaginalis and trichomonas spp. were 54.1%, 27.2% and 4.2%, respectively, in the same group of patients. in contrast,  the isolation rates of these micro-organisms in the group of patients who had no  infection (<10 leucocytes/h.p.f.) were 4.2%, 38.3%, 33% and 0.5%, respectively. in the majority of samples from which s. agalactiae was isolated, it was the sole pathogen isolated (83%) and its presence was associated with an inflammatory response in 80% of patients. furthermore, the relative risk of vaginal infection  with s. agalactiae (2.38) in patients with purulent vaginal discharge was greater than that of candida spp. infection (1.41) and lower than that of trichomonas spp. infection (8.32). these data suggest that s. agalactiae in symptomatic women with microscopic evidence of inflammation should be considered a causative agent  of vaginitis.

TI  == sterility of the uterine cavity.
AB  == in a prospective open study the sterility of the uterine cavity was evaluated in  99 women admitted for hysterectomy. the indications for hysterectomy were in most cases persistent irregular vaginal bleeding and fibromyomas of the uterus. samples for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, chlamydia trachomatis, yeasts and viruses were taken preoperatively from the apex of the vagina and cervical os. immediately after hysterectomy the uterus was opened under sterile conditions and samples obtained from the isthmus and fundus of the uterine cavity for microbiological examination. wet smears were taken from the same sites. nearly a  quarter of all the patients harbored one or more microorganisms in the uterus, mostly gardnerella vaginalis, enterobacter and streptococcus agalactiae. we found that in a significant number of cases, the uterine cavity is colonized with potentially pathogenic organisms which may play a causative role in endometritis. the results indicate that inflammation of the uterine cavity should be evaluated  by hysteroscopic examination before hysterectomy is undertaken in patients with persistent irregular vaginal bleeding.

AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == [gardnerella vaginalis in infections of reproductive organs].
AB  == the study was aimed at multidirectional studies on bacteria isolated from smears  from vagina and cervix uteri in 226 patients with inflammatory states of their reproductive organs. most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were gram-negative--27%, mainly e. coli, and enterococcus faecalis--in 18% of cases. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 81% of cases: gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 28% and lactobacillus in 53% of cases. other anaerobic bacteria were: peptococcus asaccharolyticus (15.5%), streptococcus sp. (15.9%), and bacteroides  melaninogenicus (14.1%). gardnerella vaginalis was most frequently found in chronic cases of vaginosis (41.7%). all strains of g. vaginalis were susceptible  to cefotaxime, while 15-40% of them were resistant to gentamycin, tetracycline and metronidazole.

TI  == a collaborative study of the in-vitro sensitivity to rp 59500 of bacteria isolated in seven hospitals in france.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of rp 59500 was determined against 1051 recent clinical bacterial isolates. the susceptibility to rp 59500 was determined with an agar dilution technique for all the isolates, while mics and mbcs were determined for  82 selected strains in broth. isolates of both staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci appeared to be potentially susceptible to rp 59500, independent of susceptibility to methicillin or mls resistance. (s. aureus: methicillin-sensitive, mic90, 1.0 mg/l; methicillin-resistant, mic90 1.0  mg/l; coagulase-negative staphylococci: methicillin-sensitive, mic90 0.5 mg/l). lancefield group a, b, c and g streptococci (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) appeared to be susceptible to rp 59500. some streptococcus spp. and enterococci as well as listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by a higher concentration of rp 59500 (enterococci: mic90 4 mg/l, range 0.125-16 mg/l). comparatively low mics were seen when legionella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae and gardnerella vaginalis were tested. broth dilution mic/mbc determinations showed no evidence of tolerance, as mic values were within two dilutions of mbc values. rp 59500 might be a useful compound in the treatment of infections caused by a range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to methicillin and/or macrolides.

AB  == on hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in toulouse, france, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. the following incidences were found: neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and trichomonas vaginalis: 4  (1.8%). the prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. no pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation  to clinical findings. n. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (p less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (pmn/hpf) (p less than .001). g. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (p less than .05) and in men with less than five pmn/hpf (p less than .05). isolation of c. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (p less than .05) and balanitis (p less than .001). like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. in contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates  in the management of urethritis in men.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == phospholipase c activity in microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == phospholipase c (lecithinase or phosphatidylcholine phosphorylase) catalyzes the  hydrolysis of lecithin into phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diglyceride. bacterial production of phospholipase c may damage reproductive tract tissues by both direct and indirect mechanisms. use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase c activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract. multiple aerobic  (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase  c activity. phospholipase c-producing isolates included strains of bacteroides fragilis, b. bivius, b. thetaiotaomicron, gardnerella vaginalis, and group b streptococcus. phospholipase c activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity. phospholipase c production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in  some instances of preterm birth.

TI  == is candidiasis the true cause of vulvovaginal irritation in women with diabetes mellitus?
AB  == vulvovaginitis is common in diabetic women and is often treated with antifungal agents on the assumption that the causative organism is candida albicans. in a survey of 100 consecutive diabetic women attending a diabetes clinic 36 had complained to their general practitioner about vulvovaginal irritation during the past three years and 26 were treated with antifungal agents without a vaginal examination or swabs being taken. in a separate study 27 post-menopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes and symptoms of vulvovaginitis were investigated. the organisms cultured were: candida albicans (n = 6), beta haemolytic streptococci (n = 14), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 2), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), streptococcus milleri (n = 1), streptococcus faecalis (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), no organisms (n = 3). where a bacterial organism was  isolated symptoms resolved in all but one case with appropriate antibiotic treatment. it is recommended that the practice of initiating antifungal treatment without taking high vaginal swabs should be reviewed and treatment should be given specifically rather than empirically.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

AB  == recently, strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated which are highly resistant to tetracycline (mics of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml). this resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetm, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus streptococcus and more recently in mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and gardnerella vaginalis. in n. gonorrhoeae, the tetm determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. this  plasmid arose from the insertion of tetm into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. the tetm determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of n. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.

AB  == in a 2-month prospective study of streptococci isolated from urine specimens in the laboratory, 242 strains of catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccobacilli were isolated in substantial numbers from 11,725 specimens. these comprised 10% of the important isolates. species identification of all isolates was undertaken. 74 (30%) of the isolates were of species other than streptococcus faecalis and s agalactiae. 79 (33%) were not detected on cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar after overnight incubation in a carbon dioxide incubator. 20 of the 24 isolates of coccobacilli were gardnerella  vaginalis. many of the isolates of fastidious species were accompanied by pyuria. an isolation protocol practicable in busy laboratories is proposed.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == endometrial cultures obtained by a triple-lumen method from afebrile and febrile  postpartum women.
AB  == transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. a protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (p less than .001). among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group b streptococcus, enterococcus, gardnerella vaginalis, staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery  from the endometrium. protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.

TI  == polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  == a protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. at least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were  recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. the most common organisms included gardnerella  vaginalis, peptococcus spp., bacteroides spp., staphylococcus epidermidis, group  b streptococcus, and ureaplasma urealyticum. a randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.

TI  == the comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). pefloxacin (mics mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against enterobacteriaceae. gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. pefloxacin (mics 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (mics 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.001-0.008 mg/l). pefloxacin (mics 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (mics 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (mics 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and  norfloxacin (mics 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-0.008 mg/l). the activity of pefloxacin (mics 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (mics 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin (mics 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. pefloxacin (mics mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic  strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (mics 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.

TI  == diagnosis of intrauterine infection by demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria  in the amniotic fluid.
AB  == immunofluorescence examination of amniotic fluid for the occurrence of antibody-coated bacteria was carried out in 72 consecutive women with premature rupture of the fetal membranes to assess this method in the diagnosis of intrauterine infection. antibody-coated bacteria were demonstrated in 11 women with clinical signs of intrauterine infection, histological amnionitis and heavy  growth of one bacterial species. the presence of intrauterine infection was considered possible in another 14 women. one patient had no clinical signs of infection, but positive histological and bacteriological evidence; antibody-coated bacteria were demonstrated in this patient, but not in the remaining 13 women. in 47 women clinical, histological and bacteriological signs  of intrauterine infection were absent, and examinations for antibody-coated bacteria were negative in all of them. it is concluded that the demonstration of  antibody-coated bacteria in amniotic fluid indicates the presence of intrauterine infection, and the examination may in some cases be positive before the appearance of clinical signs of infection.

TI  == vaginitis: current microbiologic and clinical concepts.
AB  == infectious vaginitis occurs when the normal vaginal flora is disrupted; it may arise when saprophytes overwhelm the host immune response, when pathogenic organisms are introduced into the vagina or when changes in substrate allow an imbalance of microorganisms to develop. examples of these types of vaginitis include the presence of chronic fungal infection in women with an inadequate cellular immune response to the yeast, the introduction of trichomonads into vaginal epithelium that has a sufficient supply of glycogen, and the alteration in bacterial flora, normally dominated by lactobacillus spp., and its metabolites that is characteristic of "nonspecific vaginitis". the authors review microbiologic and clinical aspects of the fungal, protozoal and bacterial infections, including the interactions of bacteria thought to produce nonspecific vaginitis, that are now recognized as causing vaginitis. other causes of vaginitis are also discussed.

TI  == two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography for the specific detection of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms.
AB  == glycine, one of the end products of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by a rapid, specific technique utilizing two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. a loopful of growth of each organism from its suitable agar medium was washed, suspended, and incubated with 0.1% sodium hippurate for 30 min at 37 degrees c. the supernatant of the incubated suspension from each organism was then dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. glycine, a product of hippurate hydrolysis, was detected under uv light. this technique does not require prolonged incubation and was found to be more specific and reliable than the standard ninhydrin reaction. in addition, it is inexpensive and can be easily conducted in a clinical microbiological reference laboratory. by this method, 100% (22/22) of campylobacter jejuni and 0% (0/9) of campylobacter coli reference strains were positive. in addition, 100% (13/13) of group b streptococci, 100% (24/24) of group d streptococci, and 90% (18/20) of gardenerella vaginalis clinical isolates were positive for hippurate hydrolysis. this method is useful for the identification to the species level of campylobacter organisms and the biotyping of gardnerella organisms and for the detection of hippurate hydrolysis  by unknown microorganisms.

TI  == isolation of gardnerella vaginalis from high vaginal swabs.
AB  == vaginal swabs from 2715 consecutive unselected women with vaginal discharge were  examined for gardnerella vaginalis, candida albicans and trichomonas vaginalis. of 2715 women, 2043 had non-specific vaginitis and g. vaginalis was isolated from 269 cases (13.2%). thirty five of the strains were isolated together with c. albicans, eight with t. vaginalis, six with bacteroides species and three each with group b streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus. two hundred and sixteen (80%) of the isolates were from females between the age of 20 and 34. all 269 strains hydrolysed hippurate and fermented starch; 161 (60%) were isolated from swabs without clue cells. although facts suggest that vaginal discharge in most of these cases had been associated with g. vaginalis, a possible aetiological role for other micro-organisms has not been ruled out. however, successful therapy with metronidazole in 80% of those cases suggests that g. vaginalis is one cause of non-specific vaginitis. the prevalence rate of g. vaginalis in 160 randomly selected women without vaginal discharge was 5%.

TI  == microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  == the prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococcus, lactobacillus, mycoplasma species, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and trichomonas vaginalis. specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (sd = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (sd = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (p = 0.001). sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal g. vaginalis, lactobacilli, mycoplasma species, and u. urealyticum, as well as endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoea, and t. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. significant differences in isolation  rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, and t. vaginalis. in general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; n. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. differences  were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific  vaginitis. vaginal g. vaginalis and mycoplasma species and endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. it is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.

TI  == [prevalence of 7 microorganisms in abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis)].
AB  == seven microorganisms (n. gonorrhoeae, c. albicans, t. vaginalis, g. vaginalis, m. hominis, u. urealyticum and streptococcus of group b) have been assayed in genital samplings of 164 asymptomatic women (control group) and of 374 women suffering from abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis group). all these bacteria  except group b streptococci were isolated in the vaginitis group more frequently  than in the control group (p less than 0.01). the proportion of negative cultures for all tested bacteria was 39% in the control group and 6.4% in the vaginitis group (p less than 0.01). this shows an association of these bacteria with 70% of the patients of the vaginitis group and with only 26% of the women of the control group (p less than 0.01). it is to be noted that the ph values are higher in the  group of women with vaginitis than in the control group (p less than 0.01). comparison of the microbial flora during "specific" an "non-specific" vaginitis indicates that g. vaginalis is isolated more frequently in patients with non-specific vaginitis than among those with specific vaginitis (p less than 0.01). likewise, m. hominis is isolated more frequently in groups of women with either non-specific vaginitis or t. vaginalis vaginitis, than in groups of patients with a c. albicans vaginitis (p less than 0,01). the results of this study indicate that there is a causal relationship between vaginitis and the presence of t. vaginalis. c. albicans, g. vaginalis, m. hominis or n. gonorrhoeae, either as a single or a mixed infection, and that there is a relationship between increased ph values and abnormal vaginal secretions.

TI  == the in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin were compared with that of the  other new 4-quinolone, ciprofloxacin. all three compounds were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general less susceptible, though for acinetobacter and pseudomonas species (including aeruginosa) mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 0.5-2 mg/l) than was enoxacin (mics 8-32 mg/l). staphylococci were susceptible to ofloxacin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l) and enoxacin (mics 0.5-2 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin. streptococci also were mostly sensitive to the compounds though the mics of enoxacin (4-64 mg/l) were noticeably higher than those of ofloxacin (1-4 mg/l). anaerobes were in general susceptible though, as with streptococci, ofloxacin, with activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin, was more active than enoxacin. variants of enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility were readily selected  in the laboratory with either enoxacin or ofloxacin as the selective agent. the mics of all the 4-quinolones were usually increased four- to 16-fold for these strains; they could therefore be regarded as remaining susceptible to the newer compounds.

TI  == use of a sodium polyanetholesulfonate disk for the identification of gardnerella  vaginalis.
AB  == several methods have been previously suggested for the presumptive identification of gardnerella vaginalis in clinical laboratories, but none is entirely satisfactory. we previously found that sodium polyanetholesulfonate (sps) inhibits g. vaginalis in blood culture media. we compared susceptibility to an sps-containing paper disk with beta-hemolysis on human blood agar, hippurate hydrolysis, and inhibition by alpha-hemolytic streptococci for identification of  62 previously confirmed g. vaginalis strains. all strains were positive by sps disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition, 78% were positive by beta-hemolysis, and 81% were positive by hippurate hydrolysis. although positive  reactions occurred with sps disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus tests for 5 and 9 of 84 other bacteria tested, respectively, none of these bacteria were positive for both tests. we conclude that a combination of sps disk susceptibility and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition provides excellent identification of g. vaginalis when performed by the methods suggested.

TI  == measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  == the detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. it is also useful in identifying eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera bacteroides, clostridium, actinomyces, and bacillus. currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. a 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. the reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees c. when dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees c for 4 weeks.

AB  == to study the cause of nonspecific vaginitis, we analyzed vaginal fluid from normal women and from 53 women with nonspecific vaginitis, using quantitative anaerobic cultures and gas-liquid chromatography for short-chained organic-acid metabolites of the microbial flora. in normal vaginal fluid, lactate was the predominant acid, and the predominant organisms were lactobacillus and streptococcus species (lactate producers). in nonspecific vaginitis, lactate was  decreased, whereas succinate, acetate, butyrate, and propionate were increased, the predominant flora included gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis (acetate producer), and anaerobes, which included bacteroides species (succinate producers) and peptococcus species (butyrate and acetate producers). after metronidazole therapy, symptoms and signs of nonspecific vaginitis cleared, butyrate and propionate disappeared, and lactate and lactate-producing organisms  became predominant. we conclude that certain anaerobes act with g. vaginalis as causes of nonspecific vaginitis, and that a high ratio of succinate to lactate in vaginal fluid is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of this condition.

AB  == a role for fomites such as toilet seats in the transmission of vaginitis has never been proved or disproved. a compilation of clinical data from a university  community showed that the organisms found in vaginal cultures of patients with vaginitis were, in order of frequency. candida albicans, escherichia coli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, hemophilus vaginalis and trichomonas vaginalis. in a concurrent bacteriologic survey of washroom fixtures, staphylococci and other micrococci were isolated most frequently. the overt pathogens associated with vaginitis were never found, and gram-negative organisms appeared to be suppressed by the disinfectant used by the cleaning staff. it is clear that fomites are not  an important mode of transmission in vaginitis, although a search for specific pathogens on toilets is to be continued.
