TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == bacteriological study of root canals associated with periapical abscesses.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to identify microorganisms from root canals  with periapical abscesses and to ascertain the susceptibility of peptostreptococcus prevotii and fusobacterium necrophorum to antimicrobials. study design thirty root canals were microbiologically sampled by using sterile paper points. the concomitant microorganisms were identified through the use of established methods. the susceptibility of p prevotii and f necrophorum to antimicrobials was evaluated by using the e test method. results: a total of 117  different bacterial strains were recovered, including 75 strict anaerobes or microphilic species. the most frequently isolated strict anaerobes were p prevotii, peptostreptococcus micros, and f necrophorum. facultative bacteria such as gemella morbillorum and streptococcus mitis were also found, albeit less frequently. the data revealed that p prevotii and f necrophorum were susceptible  to the tested antibiotics. conclusions: gram-positive anaerobic bacteria predominate in the mixed microbiota of root canals with periapical abscesses. moreover, p prevotii and f necrophorum are susceptible to the tested antibiotics.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
