TI  == extracellular homopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides from intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to characterize lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of ducks or pigs  with respect to the production of extracellular homopolysaccharides (hops) and oligosaccharides. methods and results: lactobacillus strains of duck or pig origin were screened for hops synthesis and >25% of the isolates produced fructans or glucans from sucrose. glucan-forming strains were found within the species lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus animalis and fructan-forming strains were found within lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus acidophilus. the glucan-forming strains of l. reuteri but not l. animalis produced glucose-oligosaccharides in additon to the respective polymers, and two fructan-forming strains of l. acidophilus produced kestose. genes coding  for glycosyltransferases were detected by pcr and partially characterized by sequence analysis. conclusions: a large proportion of lactobacilli from intestinal habitats produce hops from sucrose and polysaccharide formation is generally associated with the formation of glucose- and fructose oligosaccharides. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the metabolic potential of intestinal lactobacilli contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of autochthony in intestinal habitats. moreover, this is the first report of glucose-oligosaccharide production during growth of lactobacilli, and one novel fructosyltransferase and one novel glucansucrase were partially characterized on the genetic level.
