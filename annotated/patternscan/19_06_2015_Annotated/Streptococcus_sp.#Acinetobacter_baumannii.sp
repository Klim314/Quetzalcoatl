TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial 2004-2013.
AB  == background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. this report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013.  methods: antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. the cochran armitage trend test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. results: among the enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). against acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). the mic90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/l. 40% (6,743/16,778) of a. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. enterococci were highly susceptible  to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2%  of enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. conclusions: amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in test during 2004-2013.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == real-time comparative evaluation of biomerieux vitek ms versus bruker microflex ms, two matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry systems, for identification of clinically significant bacteria.
AB  == background: matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) recently became available for the identification of bacteria in routine diagnostic laboratories. it is rapid and cost-effective and likely to replace phenotypic identification. this study was undertaken to compare two maldi-tof ms-based, bruker microflex ms (bms) and vitek ms (vms) systems, for identification (id) of clinically significant bacterial isolates. clinically relevant broad diversity of bacterial isolates obtained during a 6-consecutive months of routine laboratory processing of clinical specimens were subjected to id by the bms and vms in parallel with vitek 2, a conventional phenotypic system  (cps). for the bms, the isolates were tested in duplicates directly and after pretreatment. identification was provided with accompanying scores according to manufacturers' instructions. with vms, single deposits of the same sets of isolates were tested in duplicates directly on maldi-plate. results were interpreted according to the manufacturer's protocols. discrepant results were resolved by 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing. results: a total of 806 pathogens comprising 507 gram-negative bacilli (gnb), 16 gram-negative cocci (gnc), 267 gram-positive cocci (gpc), and 16 gram-positive bacilli (gpb) were tested. bms and vms correctly identified isolates to genus and species levels (id 97.3% and 93.2%, and 99.8% and 99.0%, respectively). both systems as well as the  cps correctly identified the majority of the species in the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and acinetobacter baumannii. turnaround time for identification by bms and vms was <20 min compared with 24-48 h by the cps. conclusions: vms performed slightly better than bms with gpc id, especially  the streptococcus spp. some s. mitis isolates were identified as s. pneumoniae by bms. bms and vms were rapid and proved to be consistently accurate for producing  bacterial identification in a fraction of time it takes for identification by cps.

TI  == crystal structure of peptidyl-trna hydrolase from a gram-positive bacterium, streptococcus pyogenes at 2.19 a resolution shows the closed structure of the substrate-binding cleft.
AB  == peptidyl-trna hydrolase (pth) catalyses the release of trna and peptide components from peptidyl-trna molecules. pth from a gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (sppth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised.  three-dimensional structure of sppth was determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.19 a resolution. structure determination showed that the asymmetric unit of the unit cell contained two crystallographically independent molecules, designated a  and b. the superimposition of c(alpha) traces of molecules a and b showed an r.m.s. shift of 0.4 a, indicating that the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules were identical. the polypeptide chain of sppth adopted an overall alpha/beta conformation. the substrate-binding cleft in sppth is formed with three loops: the gate loop, ile91-leu102; the base loop, gly108-gly115; and  the lid loop, gly136-gly150. unlike in the structures of pth from gram-negative bacteria, the entry to the cleft in the structure of sppth appeared to be virtually closed. however, the conformations of the active site residues were found to be similar.

TI  == differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and ricu.
AB  == background: lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. this study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lrtis. methods: the clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 lrti patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) of xiangya hospital (changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. results: the infection rate of gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and ricu (p<0.05). the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05), whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection  is less in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05). in the general ward, the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (p<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (p<0.05). in the ricu, the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (p>0.05). staphylococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and ricu (41.66-54.87%), respectively (p>0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and ricu (29.60-33.88%), respectively (p>0.05). streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. conclusions: the distribution and drug sensitivity of lrti pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and ricu. streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in lrtis in some areas of china.

TI  == in vitro activity of wq-3810, a novel fluoroquinolone, against multidrug-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the in vitro antibacterial activity of wq-3810, a new fluoroquinolone, against clinically relevant pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) and fluoroquinolone-resistant (fqr) isolates, compared  with those of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. wq-3810 demonstrated the most potent activity against the antimicrobial-resistant pathogens tested. against a. baumannii, including mdr isolates, the potency of wq-3810 [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=1 mg/l] was more than eight-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin (64 mg/l) and levofloxacin (8 mg/l). against e. coli and s. pneumoniae, including fqr isolates, wq-3810 (mic(90)=4 mg/l and 0.06 mg/l, respectively) was also more active than ciprofloxacin (64 mg/l and 2 mg/l) and levofloxacin (32 mg/l and 2 mg/l). furthermore, wq-3810 was the most potent among the fluoroquinolones tested against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including fqr isolates. in particular, wq-3810 demonstrated highly potent activity against fqr isolates of a. baumannii, e. coli and s. pneumoniae with amino acid mutation(s) in the quinolone resistance-determining region of dna gyrase and/or topoisomerase iv, which are the target enzymes of fluoroquinolones. an enzyme inhibition study performed using fqr e. coli dna gyrase suggested that  the potent antibacterial activity of wq-3810 against drug-resistant isolates partly results from the strong inhibition of the target enzymes. in conclusion, this study demonstrated that wq-3810 exhibits extremely potent antibacterial activity over the existing fluoroquinolones, particularly against mdr and fqr pathogens.

AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. the purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (ca-bsis) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible ca-bsis and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with ca-bsis. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of manhattan in new york, ny, from 2006 to 2008. the ca-bsis present at hospital admission were defined as bsis occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. results: in total, 1677 ca-bsis were identified. staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (or, 2.55; 95% ci, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for s. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations  (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for s. pneumoniae (p=0.02). urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). conclusion: over 27% of the ca-bsis present on admission were antibiotic resistant. understanding the prevalence and risk factors for ca-bsis may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.

TI  == evaluation of the effects of ultraviolet light on bacterial contaminants inoculated into whole milk and colostrum, and on colostrum immunoglobulin g.
AB  == raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. according to the usda, more than 58% of calves in the united states are fed unpasteurized milk. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of uv light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum igg. a pilot-scale uv light continuous (uvc) flow-through unit (45 j/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with listeria innocua, mycobacterium smegmatis, salmonella serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with uvc. during uvc treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. the effect of uvc on igg was  evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. for each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and igg was measured using elisa. the uvc treatment of milk resulted  in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction of listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml reduction), and a. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction for m. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment  of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/ml) of listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), but not of e. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the igg concentration, with an observed final mean igg reduction of approximately 50%. development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to igg  caused by manipulating colostrum.

TI  == contamination of medical charts: an important source of potential infection in hospitals.
AB  == objective: this prospective study aims to identify and compare the incidence of bacterial contamination of hospital charts and the distribution of species responsible for chart contamination in different units of a tertiary hospital. methods: all beds in medical, surgical, pediatric, and obstetric-gynecologic general wards (556) and those in corresponding special units (125) including medical, surgical, pediatric intensive care units (icus), the obstetric tocolytic unit and delivery room were surveyed for possible chart contamination. the outer  surfaces of included charts were sampled by one experienced investigator with sterile cotton swabs rinsed with normal saline. results: for general wards and special units, the overall sampling rates were 81.8% (455/556) and 85.6% (107/125) (p = 0.316); the incidence of chart contamination was 63.5% and 83.2%,  respectively (p<0.001). except for obstetric-gynecologic charts, the incidence was significantly higher in each and in all icus than in corresponding wards. coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common contaminant in general wards (40.0%) and special units (34.6%) (p>0.05). special units had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination due to staphylococcus aureus (17.8%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (9.3%), streptococcus viridans (9.4%), escherichia coli (11.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), and acinetobacter baumannii (7.5%). logistic regression analysis revealed the incidence of chart contamination was 2- to 4-fold higher in special units than in general wards [odds ratios: 1.97-4.00]. conclusions: noting that most hospital charts are contaminated, our study confirms that a hospital chart is not only a medical record but also an important source of potential infection. the plastic cover of  the medical chart can harbor potential pathogens, thus acting as a vector of bacteria. additionally, chart contamination is more common in icus. these findings highlight the importance of effective hand-washing before and after handling medical charts. however, managers and clinical staff should pay more attention to the issue and may consider some interventions.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == synthesis, optimization, and characterization of silver nanoparticles from acinetobacter calcoaceticus and their enhanced antibacterial activity when combined with antibiotics.
AB  == background: the development of nontoxic methods of synthesizing nanoparticles is  a major step in nanotechnology to allow their application in nanomedicine. the present study aims to biosynthesize silver nanoparticles (agnps) using a cell-free extract of acinetobacter spp. and evaluate their antibacterial activity. methods: eighteen strains of acinetobacter were screened for agnp synthesis. agnps were characterized using various techniques. reaction parameters were optimized, and their effect on the morphology of agnps was studied. the synergistic potential of agnps on 14 antibiotics against seven pathogens was determined by disc-diffusion, broth-microdilution, and minimum bactericidal concentration assays. the efficacy of agnps was evaluated as per the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: only a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 produced agnps within 24 hours. monodisperse spherical nanoparticles of 8-12 nm were obtained with 0.7 mm silver nitrate at 70 degrees c. during optimization, a  blue-shift in ultraviolet-visible spectra was seen. x-ray diffraction data and lattice fringes (d =0.23 nm) observed under high-resolution transmission electron microscope confirmed the crystallinity of agnps. these agnps were found to be more effective against gram-negative compared with gram-positive microorganisms.  overall, agnps showed the highest synergy with vancomycin in the disc-diffusion assay. for enterobacter aerogenes, a 3.8-fold increase in inhibition zone area was observed after the addition of agnps with vancomycin. reduction in mic and minimum bactericidal concentration was observed on exposure of agnps with antibiotics. interestingly, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was highly sensitized in the presence of agnps and became susceptible to antibiotics except  cephalosporins. similarly, the vancomycin-resistant strain of streptococcus mutans was also found to be susceptible to antibiotic treatment when agnps were added. these biogenic agnps showed significant synergistic activity on the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. conclusion: this is the first report of synthesis of agnps using a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 and their significant synergistic activity with antibiotics resulting in increased susceptibility of multidrug-resistant bacteria evaluated as per mic breakpoints of the clsi standard.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == antibiotic resistance rates in causative agents of infections in diabetic patients: rising concerns.
AB  == the vicious cycle is that hyperglycemia (>/=11.1 mmol/l) or other diabetes-associated factors facilitate or worsen the development of infections and vice versa, the infections deteriorate the glycemic control of the patients.  diabetic patients are prone to some infections, infection recurrences and poor outcomes. immunocompromised state and frequent antibiotic use are associated with antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis (in some studies), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, bacteria in diabetic foot infections and different opportunistic and rare pathogens or multidrug-resistant strains. prompt diagnostics and susceptibility testing, early and aggressive surgical and/or antibiotic therapy, and, importantly, good glycemic control are of utmost importance for treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in diabetic patients.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == [cancer, febrile neutropenia and pulmonary images: findings in bronchoalveolar lavage in children].
AB  == introduction: lung infections are a serious complication in children with cancer. bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) has been demonstrated to be an effective procedure for achieving etiologic diagnosis. method: we did a retrospective analysis of bal data performed between november 2005 and october 2008 in children with cancer, severe neutropenia and lung infiltrates for assessing its performance, clinical utility and safety. thirty-seven bal were evaluated in 35 patients. results: focal infiltrates were demonstrated in imaging studies associated with 19/37 bal; in 8 an infectious agent was found. interstitial pattern was observed in 15/37, in which there were 4 positive studies, proving a higher microbiological performance in bal associated with focal lesions. bal yielded significant microbiological findings in 32.4% (12/37). sixteen microorganisms were identified in the study: bacteria in 8 cases, mycobacterium tuberculosis (n: 2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n: 2), acinetobacter baumannii (n: 1), a. iwoffii (n: 1), group viridans streptococcus (n: 1), mycoplasma pneumoniae (n: 1); viruses in 3 cases,  metapneumovirus (n: 2) cytomegalovirus (n: 1) and fungal infection in 5 cases, pneumocystis jiroveci (n: 2) aspergillus fumigatus (n: 1), aspergillus niger (n:  1), candida albicans (n: 1). therapeutic adjustments were done in 6/37 episodes (16.2%). conclusion: bal has a significant role in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in pediatric oncological patients, requiring a prompt and safe diagnosis, which is crucial for the survival with minimal morbidity. our results  suggest that bal by fiberbronchoscopy should be considered as an initial diagnostic tool in these patients.

TI  == human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == in this work, human serum albumin (hsa) stabilized gold nanoclusters (hsa-auncs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli j96, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (pdrab), staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). we discovered that hsa-auncs have unique affinity with s. aureus and mrsa. in addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of hsa-auncs toward s. aureus and mrsa, the binding peptide motifs identified from hsa-auncs were characterized by mass spectrometry. the identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound auncs (pep-auncs). the generated pep-auncs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with s. aureus and mrsa.

TI  == assessment of the phoenix automated system and eucast breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing against isolates expressing clinically relevant resistance mechanisms.
AB  == eucast breakpoint criteria are being adopted by automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems. the accuracy of the phoenix automated system in combination with 2012 eucast breakpoints against recent clinical isolates was evaluated. a total of 697 isolates (349 enterobacteriaceae, 113 pseudomonas spp., 25 acinetobacter baumannii, 11 stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 95 staphylococcus aureus, 6 coagulase negative staphylococci, 77 enterococci and 21 streptococcus pneumoniae) with defined resistance phenotypes and well-characterized resistance  mechanisms recovered in spain (n = 343) and italy (n = 354) were tested. comparator antimicrobial susceptibility testing data were obtained following clsi guidelines. experimental agreement (ea), defined as mic agreement +/-1 log(2) dilution, category agreement (ca) and relative discrepancies (minor (md), major (md) and very major discrepancies (vmd)) were determined. the overall ea and ca for all organism-antimicrobial agent combinations (n = 6.294) were 97.3% and 95.2%, respectively. md, md and vmd were 4.7%, 1.3% and 2.7%, all of them in agreement with the iso (iso20776-2:2007) acceptance criteria for assessment of susceptibility testing devices. vmd were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime in enterobacteriaceae and gentamicin in pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas md were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulante in enterobacteriaceae. md were mainly observed in enterobacteriaceae but distributed in different antimicrobials. for s. aureus and enterococci relative discrepancies were low. the phoenix system showed accuracy assessment in accordance with the iso standards when using eucast breakpoints. inclusion of eucast criteria in automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems will facilitate the implementation of eucast breakpoints in clinical microbiology laboratories.

TI  == reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  == the on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between gram-positive (enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced raman scattering (sers) spectroscopy. the robustness of our approach lies in the novel  method for the production of the ser substrate based on silver nanoparticles and  their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. the method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial sers substrates.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

AB  == health-care-associated pneumonia (hcap) is defined as pneumonia that develops in  patients with a history of recent hospitalization, hemodialysis as an outpatient, residence in a nursing home, outpatient intravenous therapy and home wound care.  we aimed to compare the initial demographic characteristics, causative agents and prognosis between hospitalized hcap and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) patients. hcap and cap patients hospitalized between 01 september 2008-01 september 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. out of 187 patients (131 males, mean age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years) who were hospitalized during one-year period, 98 were diagnosed as hcap and 89 as cap. among hcap patients, 64 (65.3%) had a history of hospitalization in the last 90 days, 26 (26.5%) received outpatient intravenous therapy, 17 (17.3%) had home wound care, 6 (6.1%) were on hemodialysis program in the last 30 days and 4 (4.1%) lived in a nursing home. the causative pathogen was detected in 39 (39.8%) hcap and 8 (9.0%) cap patients. the most frequently isolated microorganisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii in hcap, and streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in cap patients. inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment was documented in 8 (25.8%) of 39 hcap patients, in whom a causative agent was isolated whereas the antibiotic treatment was appropriate in all cap patients. the duration of hospitalization (14.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 10.7 +/- 7.9 days, p= 0.011) and mortality rate (34.7% vs. 9.0%, p< 0.001) were higher in hcap compared with cap patients. as hcap is different than cap in terms of patients' characteristics, causative microorganisms and prognosis, it should be considered  in all patients hospitalized as cap. potentially drug-resistant microorganisms should be taken into consideration in the empirical antibiotic treatment of these patients.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  == wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. it is therefore imperative that  antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at west virginia university hospital. standardised corrected zones of inhibition (czois) were performed on all clinical isolates. it was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. in particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of candida albicans and yeasts with czoi of 3-11.5 mm. all meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were  found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a czoi range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. czois of 4.25 mm were calculated for enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. the bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii. contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and candida albicans. no antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by kirby bauer clinical laboratory standards institute classification  system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. when a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. this finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing canward surveillance study. in total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method. compared with other cephalosporins, including  ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with a mic(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (mic(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated mrsa (mic(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against staphylococcus  epidermidis; all isolates of mssa and mrsa tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=1 mug/ml). against streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline mics (mic(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of s. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. all isolates of s. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). among gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (mic(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (mic(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against enterobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across canada in 2009.

TI  == high burden of antimicrobial resistance in asia.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in asian countries. in asia, one of  the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by ctx-m-9, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15), new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1)-producing enterobacteriaceae, mdr salmonella enterica serotypes choleraesuis and typhi, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii (oxa-58 and oxa-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant candida glabrata. a few clones of mdr a. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in asia, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing k. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed  in china. in addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant mycobacterium  tuberculosis (xdr-tb) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial drug resistance in taiwan.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. in taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (xdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant candida species. in addition, the emergence of xdr mycobacterium  tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. a few clones of xdr a. baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (st 59) have  disseminated in taiwanese hospital settings. besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in xdr p aeruginosa strains throughout taiwan. an end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.

TI  == a multicentre surveillance study on the characteristics, bacterial aetiologies and in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of  chronic bronchitis.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and the prevalence is high in many asian countries. methods: a prospective observational  study of the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) was conducted in indonesia, philippines, korea, thailand, malaysia, taiwan and hong kong from august 2006 to april 2008. the diagnosis of aecb was based on  increased cough and worsening of two of following: dyspnoea, increased sputum volume or purulence. patients who had taken antibiotics within 72 h of presentation were excluded. all bacterial strains were submitted to a central laboratory for re-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 16 antimicrobial agents according to clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: four hundred and seven isolates were identified among 447 patients of aecb. the most frequent organisms isolated were klebsiella pneumoniae and associated species (n = 91 + 17), haemophilus influenzae (n = 71), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 63), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 32), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 22) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 21). according to clinical and laboratory standards institute susceptibility breakpoints, 85.7% and >90% of these pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin and cefepime respectively. other options with overall lower susceptibilities include imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. conclusions: gram-negative bacteria including klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. constitute a large proportion of pathogens identified in patients with aecb in some asian countries. surveillance  on the local prevalence and antibiotic resistance of these organisms is important in guiding appropriate choice of antimicrobials in the management of aecb.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. this study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the pdi efficacy against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  as well as the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by  coincubation with hematoporphyrin (hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the pdi effect or by addition after pdi and further incubation for 30 min. under  conditions in which hp-pdi killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8)  cfu/ml). similar results were also found with toluidine blue o (tbo)-mediated pdi in planktonic and biofilm cells. however, without pdi treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by pdi. further studies indicated that the potentiated pdi effect  of chitosan was related to the level of pdi damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. these results indicate that the combination of pdi and chitosan is  quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

TI  == [etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.

TI  == overview perspective of bacterial resistance.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == bactericidal performance of visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst with silver nanostructures.
AB  == background: titania dioxide (tio(2)) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. visible-light responsive anion-doped tio(2) photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. the antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. methodology/principal findings: using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated tio(2) thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. among our tested titania substrates including tio(2), carbon-doped tio(2) [tio(2) (c)] and nitrogen-doped  tio(2) [tio(2) (n)], tio(2) (n) showed the best performance after silver coating. the synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii. scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on tio(2) (n) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. conclusion/significance: our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could  further influence the bactericidal property.

TI  == synergy of fosfomycin with other antibiotics for gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == background: the alarming increase in drug resistance and decreased production of  new antibiotics necessitate the evaluation of combinations of existing antibiotics. fosfomycin shows no cross-resistance to other antibiotic classes. thus, its combination with other antibiotics may potentially show synergy against resistant bacteria. objective: to evaluate the available published evidence regarding the in vitro synergistic activity of fosfomycin with other antibiotic agents against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: pubmed and the  cochrane library were searched. results: forty-one studies, including 34 (82.9%)  conducted/published before 2000, were eligible for inclusion. the relatively limited number of isolates examined and the considerable heterogeneity of the retrieved studies regarding the definitions of synergy and the methodologies used hamper conclusive remarks for specific combinations of fosfomycin with other antibiotics. yet, in the 27 studies providing data for gram-positive strains (16  for staphylococcus aureus, 3 for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and 3 for enterococcus spp.), fosfomycin showed synergy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus when combined with cefamandole, cephazolin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and rifampicin. data regarding gram-negative strains reported from 15 studies (12 exclusively for p. aeruginosa, 2 exclusively for enterobacteriaceae, 1 for both, and 1 for acinetobacter baumannii) suggested that fosfomycin showed an estimable synergistic effect with gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam against p. aeruginosa. conclusions: the synergistic combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics may be a useful  alternative treatment option for gram-negative and gram-positive infections. additional studies using more stringent definitions of synergy, and studies reporting on the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin combinations in the current era  of high antimicrobial resistance are needed.

AB  == this nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan investigated the  susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from september through november 2005. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2005 guidelines. doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of mics) in vitro activity to meropenem for enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (nfgnbs), including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and burkholderia cepacia. among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates. however, the meropenem mic(90) against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. besides, doripenem with the mic(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. because of the heavy resistance burden in taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities  against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.

AB  == background: initial reports in may 2009 of the novel influenza strain h1n1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (cfr) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. in july 2009, however, argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths,  representing a cfr of 4.5%. potential explanations for increased cfr included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. virus genomic sequencing of 26 argentinian samples representing both  severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for h1n1pdm disease. methods/principal findings: we examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (nps) from 199 cases of h1n1pdm infection from argentina with masstag pcr, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. the  study population consisted of 199 h1n1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 june and 4 july 2009. thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. at least one additional agent of  potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus a (n = 11) and b (n = 1); human rhinovirus a (n = 1)  and b (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229e (n = 1) and oc43 (n = 2); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); serratia marcescens (n = 1); and staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n = 6). the presence of s. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. s. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of h1n1pdm nps with s. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 s. pneumoniae-positive nps, p = 0.0004). in subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (or) of severe disease in the presence of s. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [ci], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001).  conclusions/significance: the association of s. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. however, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

TI  == new antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  == the optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. we herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. the newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infections. tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections  caused by enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.

TI  == [update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  == there is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics  in clinical practice. as observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. for instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. in fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium). therefore, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for gram-positive infections. this review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in france (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).

TI  == detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  == an algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. the approach was  based on a two-step procedure. the first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. the second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below  which a specific investigation is required. the algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in lyon, france. the first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. the modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further  investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (acinetobacter baumannii)  to 294 days (enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for a. baumannii) except for e. cloacae (52.1%). setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for a. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and 25% for enterobacter cloacae. the threshold values then ranged from 8 days (s. pneumoniae) to 67 days  (streptococcus pyogenes). the approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in community-acquired pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of management for community-acquired pneumonia (cap). accordingly, the choices of treatment are influenced by the likely etiologies, local resistance patterns of the pathogens, as well as patient factors. as the leading cause of acute cap, the susceptibility patterns of streptococcus pneumoniae have greatly influenced antimicrobial agents and dosage  recommended for empirical treatment of this condition. the worldwide emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has also led to discussion of this pathogen in recent revisions of the international cap guidelines. this pathogen is important because of its resistance to antibiotics commonly recommended for the empirical treatment of cap and the association with  a rapidly fatal form of pneumonia characterized by tissue necrosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and rapid progression to respiratory failure. in tropical regions of  australia and asia, cap due to acinetobacter baumannii is also increasingly recognized. this review discusses their recent epidemiology, microbiology, clinical features, and treatment of cap caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant of streptococcus sanguinis against multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == in the past decade, multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) infection has become a serious clinical problem, due to the limitation of drug choices to fight against the bacteria. here we explored the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of streptococcus (s.) sanguinis against pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa. s. sanguinis is one of the alpha-hemolytic streptococci that commonly reside in the human oral cavity. a strain of s. sanguinis, isolated from the sputum of a pulmonary-disease patient, was cultured for overnight. the filtered supernatant was tested for bactericidal effect using the minimum bactericidal concentration method on 20 strains of p. aeruginosa, including two mdrp and five  mucoid-type strains. the viable number of p. aeruginosa was decreased with time after exposing to the filtrated supernatant of s. sanguinis, and collapsed bacteria were detected with electron microscopy. of the 20 strains, 19 (95%) strains of p. aeruginosa were affected by bactericidal effect. among other species of bacteria examined, the filtrated supernatant of s. sanguinis showed remarkable bactericidal effect on 49% of indole-positive proteus species (4/9 strains) and 60% of acinetobacter (a.) baumannii (6/10 strains). we next investigated the property of bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant by treating with proteinase k or autoclave. there was no change in the bactericidal  activity of the filtrated supernatant after each treatment, excluding the involvement of protein and plasmid. here, we identify the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of s. sanguinis against mdrp. this unexpected observation may contribute to the development of a novel therapeutic drug against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == description of streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  == background: longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and staphylococcus aureus. although streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. methods: we performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for s. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from march 2003 through june 2008. results: of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). this group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to s. pneumoniae. conclusions: pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making  it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the  burn population. it should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.

AB  == the in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (tg-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following mic(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was  similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (mic(90)/range [microg/ml]; escherichia  coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; k. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).

AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. against gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline mic(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for pseudomonas aeruginosa). against gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline mic(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant a. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli  (7.0%) and k. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (45.9%)  and e. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (13.8%). tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult  to treat organisms.

TI  == the clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == the continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat  serious infections. the major success of the seven-valent streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. the almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of ctx-m beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the  united states, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanni, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.

TI  == [multicenter study on the monitoring of in vitro susceptibility to tigeeyeline in santiago, chile].
AB  == the objective of this multicenter study was to determine tigecycline susceptibility rates, measured by agar diffusion, in nine hospitals in santiago and to compare these rates with other antimicrobials. each center studied 20 strains per month. all intermediate and fully resistant strains as well as 10% of susceptibile strains were also studied by the broth microdilution method. overall, 2301 strains were studied displaying the following susceptibility rates  for tigecycline: 100% for streptococcus sp, enterococcus sp, and e. coli respectively, 99.8% for staphylococcus sp, 93% for klebsiella and 80% for acinetobacter baumarmii. for proteus, providencia and morganella the susceptibility rates were 4%. for cefotaxime-resistant klebsiella and imipenem-resistant a. baumarmii susceptibility rates were 95% and 80% respectively. the agar diffusion and broth dilution method were 100% concordant for tigecycline susceptible strains but only 27% for resistant or intermediate strains represented mostly by acinetobacter baumannii. the majority of these strains (57/59) proved to be susceptible after retesting. the great majority (96,6%) of strains tested from nine chilean hospitals proved to be susceptible to tigecycline with exception for proteus, providencia and morganella (66% resistance). using the agar diffusion method for measuring tigecycline susceptibility to a. baumannii may be misleading.

AB  == the essential oil of silver fir (abies alba) is known to help respiratory system  and have easing and soothing effect for muscle. in the present study, we investigated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and its biological activities of silver fir (abies alba) essential oil. the composition of the oil was analyzed by gc-ms and bornyl acetate (30.31%), camphene (19.81%), 3-carene (13.85%), tricyclene (12.90%), dl-limonene (7.50%), alpha-pinene (2.87%), caryophyllene (2.18%), beta-phellandrene (2.13%), borneol (1.74%), bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene,2,3-dimethyl (1.64%) and alpha-terpinene (1.24%) were the major components in the oil. the results tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay indicated that the oil showed no cytotoxic effect, at concentrations of 1 and 5%, for as long as 24 and 3 h, respectively. the antiradical capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oil on the 2,20-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (dpph) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (abts) radicals. the oil was able to reduce the both radicals dose-dependently, and the concentration required for 50% reduction  (rc(50)) against dpph radicals (2.7 +/- 0.63%) was lower than abts radicals (8.5  +/- 0.27%). the antibacterial activity of the oil was also evaluated using disc diffusion method against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, listeria monocytogenes, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and vibrio parahaemolyticcus. the oil exhibited no antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested except s. aureus of mild activity.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

AB  == objective: bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. the objective of this study was to explore application of the combined  detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. methods: totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. the age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by  streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. the aspirate samples were also amplified for dna of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (tem-pcr) and detected with luminex xmap technology platform. results: the total positive rate  by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were hemophilus  influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187)  were acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. the total positive rate by combined detection of culture and tem-pcr assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. conclusion: the tem-pcr assay may increase the detection rate of hemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. the tem-pcr needs further improvement for diagnosis of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  == we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan  to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey  (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of  respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and  imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing  results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin hydrate (du-6859a, gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and acinetobacter baumannii. the in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. in a published phase ii randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). results of the phase iii trials of sitafloxacin are not available in english. the clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. the most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders  (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. for japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. while it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest.
AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == beta-lactams against emerging 'superbugs': progress and pitfalls.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is an ever-growing problem. so-called 'superbugs', such as multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring multiple resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, efflux pumps and downregulated outer-membrane proteins or porins, are becoming more prevalent in hospital, intensive and long-term care settings. enterobacteriaceae are also acquiring a myriad of beta-lactamases, such as class a and d carbapenemases, and plasmid-borne class c cephalosporinases. gram-positive superbugs, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate or heteroglycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), are problematic pathogens,  both in the hospital and in the community (e.g., community-acquired mrsa and prsp). beta-lactam antibiotics remain among the most effective and safest anti-infectives in use, although their utility is being severely challenged by these superbugs. this review will discuss aspects of resistance seen in these pathogens and will review some of the newer beta-lactam agents, both investigational and in clinical use, that target these superbugs.

TI  == bacterial resistance surveillance in china: a report from mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in china. a total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15  cities throughout china. antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by clinical and  laboratory standards institute. the results of the mics revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of  staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of staphylococcus epidermidis strains. penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. five strains of enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. all staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. a high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the gram-positive cocci. enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation  cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. about 65% of the escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less  than 10%. imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant  isolates. combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. amikacin was active against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. in conclusion,  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive s. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in china. no glycopeptides-resistant staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci was seldom.

TI  == a class iia peptide from enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  == peptide st4sa, produced by enterococcus mundtii st4sa, inhibits the growth of acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. the peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to s. pneumoniae 40, pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and e. faecium hklhs. low concentrations of peptide st4sa (51200 arbitrary units (au)/ml) caused dna and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400au/ml caused cell lysis.  no decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. peptide st4sa revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. peptide st4sa  dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.

TI  == postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  == background: antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. however, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. methods: to evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between january 2000 and december 2004. for patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. results: a postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). sixty patients (78.9%)  experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. a microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. pathogens responsible for the infections were staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group b streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable streptococcus organisms (n = 2), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), haemophilus spp. (n = 9), branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), enterobacteriaceae (n  = 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and candida spp. (n = 4). according to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. conclusions: this study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in taiwan with an emphasis on klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of copd (aecopd). this study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of aecopd. methods: medical records from 494 episodes of aecopd in patients admitted to the national taiwan university hospital from january 2000 to june 2004 were reviewed. severity of copd was classified according to the 2003 global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease guideline. results: potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of aecopd. the predominant bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%),  pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), enterobacter species (6.1%) and staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). the incidence of streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. k. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage i copd (39.1%) than stage ii  (16.6%), iii (13.8%) and iv (9.4%). no glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage i patients. multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that p. aeruginosa (odds ratio (or) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.21-8.38), intubation (or 14.81; 95% ci: 5.08-43.12) and age (or  1.1; 95% ci: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. conclusions: klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with aecopd in taiwan, with the former being more commonly  isolated from mild copd and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. these results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with aecopd.

AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

TI  == visible-light-induced bactericidal activity of a nitrogen-doped titanium photocatalyst against human pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (tio(2)) substrates is induced primarily by uv light irradiation. recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. their antibacterial activity, however, remains  to be quantified. in this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against escherichia coli compared to pure tio(2) and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates. we also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. in the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including shigella flexneri, listeria  monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates than by pure tio(2) substrates. these findings suggest that nitrogen-doped tio(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. it is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. in 1996 the american thoracic society (ats) published guidelines for empirical therapy of hap. this review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ats statement. early diagnosis of hap and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) or protected specimen brush (psb) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic bal/psb in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of hap is by definition empirical. epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. studies that have appeared since the ats statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for hap with multiresistant pathogens. in patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. the most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of hap (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical  ventilation. multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. to further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.since the ats statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for hap should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from shanghai, china.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in shanghai, china were determined and compared with selected comparators. results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. it was highly active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. tigecycline also  had good activity against most strains of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis. however, it was poorly active against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as peptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. it was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic  gram-positive cocci. tigecycline was bactericidal against all gram-positive cocci tested except enterococcus spp. inoculum size but not ph of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in china may have some effects on mic values of tigecycline.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in taiwan. while some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be  unique for specific regions. methods: to determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from chang gung memorial hospital at chia-yi from january 2002 through december 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. results: the most common gram-positive isolate was staphylococcus aureus. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by acinetobacter baumannii. oxacillin resistance rate of s. aureus was  58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. the penicillin non-susceptibility rate of streptococcus pneumoniae was  52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. resistance to various antimicrobial agents for p. aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. infections caused by multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant a. baumannii was rarely encountered. antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid salmonella, s. choleraesuis and serogroup b isolates in particular. conclusion: the high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.

AB  == between january 1986 and december 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital. to compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among  our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). in this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. of the pathogens, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by viridans (v.) streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. other rare organisms including acinetobacter baumannii, salmonella group b and d, proteus mirabilis, group b, d, and non-a, non-b and non-d streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. there was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with v. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with k. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. the timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates  to a glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.

AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  == effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. this study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with hap. the mean age  of patients was over 70 years. more than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. there was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (apache) iii score between the hap-cefepime and hap-ceftazidime group. the most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with cap were streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 7), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). in patients with hap, p. aeruginosa (n = 13), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), serratia marcescens (n = 6), k. pneumoniae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia  (n = 5), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and escherichia  coli (n = 2) were isolated. the cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the cap-cefepime group, the hap-cefepime group, and the hap-ceftazidime group, respectively. the increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing cap and hap indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial  agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == high prevalence of antibiotic resistance of common pathogenic bacteria in taiwan. the antibiotic resistance study group of the infectious disease society of the republic of china.
AB  == we analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of all clinical isolates of 14 common pathogenic bacteria recovered from patients in eight medical centers in taiwan during 1995 and 1996. susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method as recommended by the national committee  for clinical laboratory standards. of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, 59.3% and 62% were oxacillin-resistant in 1995 and 1996, respectively, whereas 63.2% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates during the study period were oxacillin-resistant. the rate of penicillin-resistance among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 39.7% in 1995 and 53.7% in 1996. macrolide-resistance was found in 71.4%, 42.1%, and 46.7% of s. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci, respectively, in 1996. less than 2% of the enterococcal isolates were vancomycin resistant, but 77% of them were gentamicin  resistant. resistance to gentamicin was also common in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. various degrees of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin were detected in enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and a. baumannii. more than 55% of haemophilus influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. in summary, resistance to many antimicrobial agents in various common  pathogenic bacteria is very common in taiwan. our results implicate that antibiotic resistance in the developing countries need to be monitored closely.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

AB  == we retrospectively reviewed the variation of the organisms recovered from 403 protected bronchopulmonary specimens in three surgical intensive care units according to the time elapsed from admission. the predominant pathogens during the four first days were haemophilus influenzae (33.3%), staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), mostly methicillin susceptible strains, and streptococcus pneumoniae (14.3%). after the fourth day, they were progressively replaced by typical nosocomial bacteria such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. for pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae, strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins occurred significantly later than the susceptible strains. these results indicate that the time elapsed from intensive care unit admission has a major influence on the bacteriology of respiratory tract infections, but no clear cut-off point between early-onset and late onset pneumonia is evident.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == mics of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. clarithromycin was the most active drug against bacteroides spp. but the least active against haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was most active against h. influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pasteurella multocida, and fusobacterium spp. but the least active against streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. all three drugs had equivalent activities against staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. none of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (particularly escherichia coli and citrobacter diversus) and acinetobacter baumannii. although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible  to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.

(iii) chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii 1-  greater than 128: s. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + proteus 0.06-0.12. activity of cbt was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, cbt was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. cbt was inactive on p. aeruginosa (mic greater than or equal to 32) and  on a. baumannii (8- greater than 128). haemophilus and gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to cbt (mic 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for meningococci; b. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin g) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin g). cbt was inactive on staphylococci. enterococci and streptococci b were generally resistant; streptococci a, c, g were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas mic for other streptococci 0.12 to 128 (mic 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). these antibacterial properties particularly against enterobacteriaceae placed cbt in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
