inhibition of bacillus cereus strains by antimicrobial metabolites from lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21.
bacillus cereus is an endospore-forming, gram-positive bacterium able to cause foodborne diseases. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are known for their ability to synthesize organic acids and bacteriocins, but the potential of these compounds against b. cereus has been scarcely documented in food models. the present study has examined the effect of the metabolites produced by lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21 on the viability of select b. cereus strains. furthermore, the effect of e. faecium sm21 metabolites against b. cereus strains has also been investigated on a rice food model. l. johnsonii crl1647 produced 128 mmol/l of lactic acid, 38 mmol/l of acetic acid and 0.3 mmol/l of phenyl-lactic acid. these organic acids reduced the number of vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains tested. however, the antagonistic effect disappeared at ph 6.5. on the other hand, e. faecium sm21 produced only lactic and acetic acid (24.5 and 12.2 mmol/l, respectively) and was able to inhibit both vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains, at a final fermentation ph of 5.0 and at ph 6.5. this would indicate the action of other metabolites, different from organic acids, present in the cell-free supernatant. on cooked rice grains, the e. faecium sm21 bacteriocin(s) were tested against two b. cereus strains. both of them were significantly affected within the first 4 h of contact; whereas b. cereus bac1 cells recovered after 24 h, the effect on b. cereus 1 remained up to the end of the assay. the lab studied may thus be considered to define future strategies for biological control of b. cereus.
properties of different lactic acid bacteria isolated from apis mellifera l. bee-gut.
eight strains belonging to lactobacillus spp. and five to enterococcus spp. were  isolated from the gut of worker apis mellifera l. bees. studies based on 16s rrna sequencing revealed that aj5, ig9, a15 and crl1647 strains had a 99% identity with lactobacillus johnsonii, while sm21 showed a 99% similarity with enterococcus faecium. l. johnsonii crl1647, aj5 and ig9 were high lactic acid producers (values were between 177 and 275 mm), and in vitro they inhibited different human food-borne pathogens and paenibacillus larvae, the american foulbrood agent. this bacterium was the most sensitive to the lactic acid effect being inhibited by 44 mm of this metabolite. l. johnsonii crl1647, aj5 and ig9 also presented important surface properties. these cells showed between 77% and 93% of auto-aggregation. the preliminary study of the chemical nature of the aggregating factors revealed that the molecules involved in the surface of each l. johnsonii strain were quite complex; and something of a peptidic nature was mainly involved. e. faecium sm21 produced bacteriocin-like compounds with anti-listeria effects. furthermore, a band close to 6.0-7.5 kda was detected by sds-page studies, and the enta, b and p structural genes were amplified by pcr reactions. for the first time, bee-gut associated l. johnsonii and e. faecium strains have been isolated, identified, cultivated and some of their functional properties reported.
