TI  == probiotic bacteria lactobacillus and bifidobacterium attenuate inflammation in dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis in mice.
AB  == it is widely accepted that inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) arises from a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the enteric microbiota in the gut of a genetically susceptible individual. no definitive therapies are available for this inflammatory disorder. therefore it became imperative to develop new strategies for treating this disease. probiotics have emerged as a potential new  therapeutic strategy for ibd, however their exact mechanisms of action is still poorly defined. in this study, we address the potential effect of a probiotic cocktail (ultrabiotique(r)) composed of four live bacterial strains (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, b. lactis and b.breve) to promote recovery from acute  colitis. probiotic was given to mice by oral gavage after the onset of colitis and the establishment of dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced intestinal injury.  clinical parameters were monitored daily, histological scores of colitis and the  production of nitric oxide (no) and interferon-&#947; (ifn-&#947;) were determined. in addition, tlr4, nf-&#954;b and inos colonic expression were examined. probiotic treatment ameliorated clinical symptoms and histological scores. no and ifn-&#947; production in plasma were decreased by probiotic. these results were associated with reduced tlr4, inos and nf-&#1082;b expression in colonic tissue. in conclusion, probiotic exerted anti-inflammatory effects and contributed to a rapid recovery of dss-induced acute colitis.

TI  == evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to test the suitability of transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (tos-mup) and mrs-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (mrs-cc) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab)  species commonly used to make fermented milks. pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. tos-mup agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and b. breve m-16 v. mrs-cc agar showed relatively good selectivity for lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of lb. casei strains. for this reason, mrs-cc agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of lb. acidophilus if lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of lb. acidophilus.  unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped lab, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in mrs ph 5.4 agar incubated under  anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c for 72 h. therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of lactobacillus spp.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacterium species stimulate human slc26a3 gene function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == slc26a3, or downregulated in adenoma (dra), plays a major role in mediating cl(-) absorption in the mammalian intestine. disturbances in dra function and expression have been implicated in intestinal disorders such as congenital cl(-)  diarrhea and gut inflammation. we previously showed that an increase in dra function and expression by lactobacillus acidophilus and its culture supernatant  (cs) might underlie antidiarrheal effects of this probiotic strain. however, the  effects of bifidobacterium species, important inhabitants of the human colon, on  intestinal cl(-)/hco3 (-) exchange activity are not known. our current results demonstrate that cs derived from bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium bifidum increased anion exchange activity in caco-2 cells ( approximately 1.8- to 2.4-fold). consistent with the increase in dra function, cs also increased the protein, as well as the mrna, level of dra (but not putative anion transporter 1). cs of all three bifidobacterium sp. increased dra promoter  activity (-1,183/+114 bp) in caco-2 cells (1.5- to 1.8-fold). furthermore, the increase in dra mrna expression by cs of b. breve and b. infantis was blocked in  the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin d (5 mum) and the erk1/2  mapk pathway inhibitor u0126 (10 mum). administration of live b. breve, b. infantis, and b. bifidum by oral gavage to mice for 24 h increased dra mrna and protein levels in the colon. these data demonstrate an upregulation of dra via activation of the erk1/2 pathway that may underlie potential antidiarrheal effects of bifidobacterium sp.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of selected oxalate-degrading probiotic bacteria: potential applications in the prevention and treatment of hyperoxaluria.
AB  == oxalate (ox) is a very common component of the human diet, capable to collect in  the renal tissue and bind calcium to form calcium oxalate (caox) crystals. a supersaturation of caox crystal may cause nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. the inflammation derived from the caox crystal accumulation, together with innate or secondary renal alterations, could strongly affect the renal function. in this case a consumption of probiotics with either oxalate-degrading activity at intestinal level and systemic anti-inflammatory activity could be an alternative  approach to treat the subjects with excess of urinary oxalate excretion. 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria), already included in the list of bacteria safe for the human use, were investigated for their capability to degrade oxalate by mean of rp-hplc-uv method and modulate inflammation in an in vitro model system based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. four promising bacterial strains (lactobacillus plantarum pbs067, lactobacillus acidophilus la-14, bifidobacterium breve pbs077, bifidobacterium longum pbs078) were identified as innovative biological tools for the prevention  and the therapeutic treatment of hyperoxaluria and the inflammatory events associated to the ox accumulation. practical application: the oxalate-degrading activity of some probiotics and their capability to modulate the release of inflammation mediators could be exploited as a new nutraceutical and therapeutic  approach for the treatment of oxalate accumulation and the related inflammatory state.

TI  == [probiotics improve obesity-associated dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed rats].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect of probiotics (bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus) on serum lipid, serum insulin and insulin resistance in high-fat diet (hfd)-induced obese rats. methods: fifty male sprague-dawley rats were randomly assigned to a control (n=10) and a high fat diet groups (n=40) and were fed with standard diet and hfd respectively. four weeks later, thirty-six hfd-induced obese rats were randomly administered with normal saline (ns), bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus daily (n=12 each). four weeks later, body lengths, body weights and abdomen circumference of rats were measured, blood lipid, glucose and insulin levels were measured, and lee's index  and insulin resistance index were calculated. results: body weight, abdomen circumference, lee's index, fasting glucose, triglyceride (tg), total cholesterol (tc), low density lipoprotein (ldl) in the ns-treated hfd group were significantly higher than the control group (p<0.05). the bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus-treated groups had significantly lower levels of body weight, abdomen circumference, lee's index, fasting glucose, tc, tg and ldl  than the ns-treated hfd group (p<0.05), but the levels of the parameters in the bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus-treated groups were significantly higher than the control group (p<0.05). high density lipoprotein (hdl) and insulin sensitivity index in the ns-treated hfd group were significantly lower than the control group (p<0.05). bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus treatment dramatically increased hdl levels and insulin sensitivity index compared with the ns-treated hfd group (p<0.05), although the levels of the two parameters did not reach to the levels of the control group. there were significant differences in the levels of fasting insulin, insulin resistance index and insulin secretion index between the bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus acidophilus groups (p<0.05). conclusions: lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium breve can decrease serum levels of lipid and glucose and improve insulin resistance in obese rats. bifidobacterium breve seems to be more effective on attenuating insulin resistance than lactobacillus acidophilus.

TI  == interaction of aeromonas strains with lactic acid bacteria via caco-2 cells.
AB  == the genus aeromonas includes some species that have now been identified as human  pathogens of significant medical importance. we investigated the ability of 13 selected aeromonas strains belonging to nine species isolated from clinical cases (n = 5), environmental waters (n = 5), and fish (n = 3) to adhere to and translocate caco-2 cells in the absence and presence of two lactic acid bacteria  (lab), i.e., lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium breve. aeromonas isolates were also assessed for their cytotoxicity, the presence of virulence genes, and hemolysin production. among the clinical isolates, one strain of aeromonas veronii biovar veronii and two strains of aeromonas hydrophila carried  cytotoxin (act), heat-labile toxin (alt), hemolysin (hlya), and aerolysin (aera)  genes, were cytotoxic to vero cells, produced hemolysin, and showed higher adherence to caco-2 cells. in contrast, this was seen in only one environmental strain, a strain of a. veronii biovar sobria. when aeromonas strains were coinoculated with lab onto caco-2 cells, their level of adhesion was reduced. however, their rate of translocation in the presence of lab increased and was significantly (p < 0.05) higher among fish strains. we suggest that either the interaction between aeromonas and lab strains could have a detrimental effect on  the caco-2 cells, allowing the aeromonas to translocate more readily, or the presence of the lab stimulated the aeromonas strains to produce more toxins and/or increase their translocation rate.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == beneficial role of the probiotic mixture ultrabiotique on maintaining the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier in dss-induced experimental colitis.
AB  == the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases which include ulcerative colitis (uc) and crohn disease has not yet been clarified. several hypotheses suggest a change in composition of gut microflora along with an impaired mucosal barrier that lead to excessive mucosal immunologic responses. increased production of nitric oxide  (no) contributes greatly to the tissue injury caused by chronic inflammation. evidence indicates that the mucus layer covering the epithelium is altered during uc and experimental colitis. our aim in this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of probiotic during dss-induced colitis by modulating the immune system and colonic mucus production. for that purpose, the  probiotic formulation ultrabiotique((r)) (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium breve) was administered daily for 7 d to mice with colitis. probiotic supplementation improved clinical symptoms and histological alterations observed during dss induced colitis. ultrabiotique((r)) treatment down regulated the no production by peritoneal macrophages of dss-treated mice and enhanced mucus production in both  dss-treated and healthy mice. in conclusion, the modification of microflora by the ultrabiotique((r)) played a beneficial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and promoted tissue repair.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in a  premature rat model. methods: one hundred fifty-eight premature sprague-dawley premature rats were enrolled. probiotic strains bifidobacterium bifidum, b longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l plantarum, and b breve were fed as a single  strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. colony counts of probiotic strains escherichia coli and klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. the incidence of death and nec were compared via fisher exact test  between groups. results: the results demonstrated that l plantarum alone (p = 0.0026) and b bifidum with b longum together (p = 0.0017) were more effective in  reducing nec as compared with the control group. all of the study groups except b breve and b bifidum with b breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. b bifidum and b longum together had significantly lower mortality than  the control group (p < 0.0001). colony counts of e coli and klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the b bifidum, b longum, and l plantarum  group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. conclusions: administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with b bifidum and  b longum was most effective in preventing death and nec in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.

TI  == protection of probiotic bacteria in a synbiotic matrix following aerobic storage  at 4 degrees c.
AB  == the survival of single strains of bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri was investigated in synbiotics that included 10 mg/ml of fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides in an alginate matrix under refrigerated (4 degrees c) aerobic storage conditions. when the matrices were cross-linked with calcium (45  mm), 102-103 cfu/ml of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, and 0-103 cfu/ml of b. breve and b. longum survived refrigerated aerobic storage for 28 days. following  refrigerated storage, acetic (3-9 mm), butyric (0-2 mm), propionic (5-16 mm) and  lactic acids (1-48 mm) were produced during the growth of probiotics in bhi broth at 37 degrees c, suggesting their metabolic activity after storage was stressed.  when calcium cross-linking was not used in synbiotics, the matrix remained more gel-like after inoculation when compared to the calcium cross-linked matrix. at least 107 cfu/ml of probiotic bacteria survived after 21 days of storage within these gel-like alginate matrices. significantly higher levels of b. breve, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri were obtained from the synbiotic matrices supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides compared to alginate alone. b. longum survival was the same (~7 logs) in all gel-like synbiotic matrices. these results show that synbiotics protected probiotic bacteria and extended their shelf-life under refrigerated aerobic conditions. synbiotics represent a viable delivery vehicle for health-promoting bacteria.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with  diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in  the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after  treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the  stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == utilization of monolinolein as a substrate for conjugated linoleic acid production by bifidobacterium breve lmc 520 of human neonatal origin.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate bifidobacteria from human intestines that efficiently converts monolinolein, a monoglyceride form of linoleic acid, into conjugated linoleic acid (cla), as well as to optimize culture conditions for improving cla production during milk fermentation. among 150 screened neonatal bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium breve lmc 520 showed the highest cla-producing ability and was tested with different types of fat substrates at various concentrations to determine the optimal conditions for cla production. monolinolein was tested as a substrate for cla production. the incubation time optimized for cla production was 24 h, and cla production was proportionally increased with monolinolein concentration. the incubation of lmc 520 with commercial starter strains caused minimal reduction in cla production. our results demonstrate that the cla-producing ability of b. breve lmc 520 could offer beneficial effects when utilized as a starter culture for the development of functional dairy products.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial fermentation increases the antiallergic effects of ixeris dentata.
AB  == ixeris dentata (id, family asteraceae), called seumbakuy in korea, was fermented  with lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antiallergic activities were investigated. fermentation of id with bifidobacterium breve or lactobacillus acidophilus increased its inhibition of degranulation in rbl-2h3 cells induced by the ige-antigen complex. oral administration of these extracts to mice inhibited  the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca) reaction induced by the ige-antigen complex and scratching behaviors induced by compound 48/80. the fermented id more potently inhibited the pca reaction and scratching behaviors than the non-fermented one. these extracts also inhibited mrna expression of tnf-alpha and il-4, as well as nf-kappab activation in rbl-2h3 cells induced by the ige-antigen complex. these findings suggest that lab fermentation improves id-mediated inhibition of ige-induced allergic diseases such as rhinitis and asthma, and that id works by inhibiting degranulation and nf-kb activation in mast cells and basophils.

TI  == surface expression of toll-like receptor 9 is upregulated on intestinal epithelial cells in response to pathogenic bacterial dna.
AB  == colonic epithelial cells are constantly exposed to high levels of bacterial dna in the intestinal lumen and must recognize and respond appropriately to pathogens, while they maintain a tolerance to nonpathogenic commensal bacterial strains. bacterial dna is recognized by toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9). the aim of this study was to investigate tlr9 expression and localization in colonic epithelial cells under basal conditions and in response to bacterial dna. ht-29 cells were exposed to dna from various strains of commensal and pathogenic microbes. tlr9 mrna expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription-pcr, and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. localization of tlr9 was determined by flow cytometry in ht-29 cells and by immunofluorescence in ht-29 cells and mouse colonic tissue. immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that there was intracellular and surface expression of tlr9 in ht-29 cells under basal conditions. exposure of cells to dna from pathogenic strains of salmonella and escherichia coli resulted in a significant increase in tlr9 mrna expression. salmonella enterica serovar dublin dna increased surface tlr9 protein and il-8 secretion. there was no change in mrna levels or localization of tlr9 in response to bifidobacterium breve. chloroquine did not block il-8 secretion in response to s. enterica serovar dublin dna. tlr9 was expressed on the colonic apical surface  in wild-type mice but not in germfree mice. these results demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells recognize pathogenic bacterial dna and respond by increasing surface localization and expression of tlr9, suggesting that the epithelial inflammatory response to pathogenic dna is mediated at least in part by increased tlr9 expression.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == effect of ginseng polysaccharide on the stability of lactic acid bacteria during  freeze-drying process and storage.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) quickly attenuate or are killed during the freeze-drying process and storage. the effect of some natural polysaccharides, which are known as potent antitumor and immunomodulating substances, on the viability of the lab, lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium breve, on freeze-drying and storage were investigated. among the polysaccharides tested, red ginseng polysaccharide (rgp) and chitosan significantly inhibited the cell death of the lab during freeze-drying, and fucoidan and rgp most potently protected the cell death of the lab during storage. the stabilities of the lab on the addition of rgp and fucoidan were comparable to that of skimmed milk. however, white ginseng polysaccharide (wgp) did not promote storage stability. when 5% skimmed milk/5% rgp treated lab were freeze-dried and stored, their viabilities were found to be significantly higher those treated with 5% or 10% rgp. the stabilizing effect of 5% rgp/5% skimmed milk during lab freeze-drying and storage stability was comparable to that of treatment with 10% skimmed milk.  based on these findings, we believe that rgp beneficially improves the stability  of lab during the freeze-dry process and storage.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == increased growth of bifidobacterium and eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. gbf improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (scfa), especially butyrate. in this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. daily administration of 9 g gbf for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. fecal bifidobacterium and eubacterium were also significantly increased by gbf administration in healthy volunteers. ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing gbf as a sole carbon source (gbf medium). after a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, bacteroides ovatus, clostridium butyricum, and  eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium ph producing scfa. eubacterium grown together with bifidobacterium in gbf medium efficiently produced butyrate. on the other hand, gbf changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. as a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium. this butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == enhancement of lysozyme trypsin-mediated decay of intestinal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  == lysozyme-mediated lysis of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was studied in in vitro tests using the agar gel plate and turbidometric micrococcus luteus (lysodeikticus) procedure as a standard. suspensions of the strains bifidobacterium infantis, b. infantis liberorum, b. breve, b. longum, b. ssp, and lactobacillus acidophilus proved to be resistant to egg white lysozyme and human  milk lysozyme when incubated at 37 degrees c in concentrations of 5, 50, and 500  mg lysozyme/l, respectively, through 30 and 60 min. heat treatment at 100 degrees c for 1 h and pretreatment with ether, acetone, ascorbic acid, and hydrogen peroxide failed to incline the bacteria to the lytic effects of lysozyme. consecutive incubation of the lysozyme-pretreated bacteria with trypsin resulted  in a significantly enhanced bacteriolysis in all strains of bacteria, with the exception of b. longum. the mode of action of lysozyme and proteolytic enzymes on bifidobacteria and lactobacilli offers an explanation for the release of microbial building blocks and their colonic absorption and retention in the breast-fed baby.

TI  == viability and enzymatic activity of bifidobacteria in milk.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve ncfb 2258, bifidobacterium bifidum ncfb 2715, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, bifidobacterium angulatum atcc 27535, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 were evaluated for viability and beta-galactosidase  and alpha-galactosidase activities under conditions of refrigerated and frozen storage in reconstituted ndm. beta- and alpha-galactosidase activities were variable. bifidobacterium angulatum 27535 exhibited much greater enzymatic activities than those of the other strains. all strains demonstrated culture and  enzyme stability upon refrigerated storage in fermented and unfermented reconstituted ndm. bifidobacteria were significantly less tolerant of low temperature storage than was l. acidophilus n2.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == transient colonization of the gut of newborn infants by orally administered bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  == we investigated if orally administered bifidobacteria and/or lactobacilli could be cultured from faeces of infants after antibiotic treatment, when these bacterial species are usually absent. lyophilized bifidobacterium longum, strain  bb-536, b. breve, strain bb-576, or lactobacillus acidophilus, strain lac-343, were used. doses of 3 x 10(9) cells of one strain, or a mixture of all three strains 3 x 10(9) cells each were fed three times daily at mealtimes to 11 infants aged 0-8 weeks. treatment was started the first day after antibiotic treatment and was continued for 5 days. the bacterial species were isolated in 9  of 11, 7 of 10 and 2 of 9 specimens obtained on the last day of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli administration, 5 and 15 days thereafter, respectively. no side effects were noted.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
