TI  == identification of a chromosome-borne expanded-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from erwinia persicina.
AB  == from whole-cell dna of an enterobacterial erwinia persicina reference strain that displayed a penicillinase-related antibiotic-resistant phenotype, a beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. it encoded a clavulanic-acid-inhibited ambler class a beta-lactamase, erp-1, with a pi value of 8.1 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 28 kda. erp-1 shared 45 to 50% amino  acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from citrobacter koseri, kluyvera ascorbata, kluyvera cryocrescens, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus penneri, rahnella aquatilis, serratia fonticola, yersinia enterocolitica, and the plasmid-mediated enzymes ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-9. the substrate profile of the noninducible erp-1 was similar  to that of these beta-lactamases. erp-1 is the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species that is plant associated and plant pathogenic.

TI  == [sero- and biovars of levinea malonatica (syn. citrobacter diversus, citrobacter  koseri) in clinical material (author's transl)].
AB  == the biochemical and serological examination of 31 strains of levinea malonatica isolated from faeces, urine, sputum, wound infections and blood showed no correlation of bio- or serovars with the origin of the strains. serological cross-reactions between o-antigens of l. malonatica and certain salmonella, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica serovars were analysed. they are low-titred  and seem to be of minor importance. sensitivity testing revealed the resistance of l. malonatica against penicillin, ampicillin and carbenicillin.

TI  == some interesting isolates from a diagnostic laboratory.
AB  == citrobacter koseri, plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, yersinia enterocolitica, alkalescens dispar, vibrio parahaemolyticus, and vibrio alginolyticus were seven interesting microorganisms isolated recently in our diagnostic laboratory.

TI  == enterobacteria of emerging pathogenic significance from clinical cases in man and animals and detection of toads and wall lizards as their reservoirs.
AB  == a total of 416 samples comprising faecal samples from diarrhoeic cases of man, calves, sheep and goats, and urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections, were examined for the presence of enterobacteria of emerging pathogenic significance. citrobacter freundii from 20, c. intermedius biotype-a from four, serratia marcescens (serotype 05:h13, bactericin type 16) from one and erwinia herbicola from two human stool samples were isolated. only two urine samples yielded c. freundii. citrobacter freundii was isolated from 10 and c. intermedius biotype-a from two calves. from sheep and goats, two isolates of c. freundii and three of c. intermedius biotype-a were obtained. none of these samples yielded edwarsiella tarda or yersinia enterocolitica. the examination of  99 toads and 145 wall lizards revealed that toads were reservoirs for c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a and salmonella brijbhumi, whereas wall lizards were reservoirs for c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a, e. herbicola, enterobacter cloacae and salmonella spp. these bacteria were present in the range of 2.0 x 10(6) to 6.0 x 10(11) organisms per gram of intestinal contents. in addition, toads were carriers for edwardsiella tarda (new serotypes 04167:h1 and  05159: non-motile). none of the toads and wall lizards proved positive for c. intermedius biotype-b (c. koseri), s. marcescens and y. entercolitica. c. freundii, c. intermedius biotype-a, e. herbicola and s. marcescens were resistant to penicillin and erythromycin whereas e. tarda isolates were also resistant to gentamycin, neomycin, colistin and sulfamethaxazole.
