TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == [interaction of bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  == aim: study the influence of exometabolites of b. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. materials and methods: bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: b. bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcusfaecium and escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. as opportunistic microorganisms cultures of e. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were used. isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. in the first series of experiments influence of b. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. in the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of b. bifidum, l. acidophilus and e. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. growth properties (gp), biofilm formation (bff) and anti-lysozyme activity (ala) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. optical density measurement were performed on elx808 (biotek, u.s.a.) photometer. the data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using mann-whitney criteria. results: b. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, bff and ala of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on bff of associants were revealed. the maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations e. coli lac "+"/hly "-" e. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as e. faecium--s. aureus. conclusion: thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.

TI  == antagonistic action of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in relation to staphylococcus aureus and their influence on the immune response in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of lactobacillus casei imv b-7280, lact. acidophilus imv b-7279, bifidobacterium longum vk1, and b. bifidum vk2 strains or their various compositions in relation to staphylococcus aureus in vitro and on models  of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. it was found that under the influence of these strains and their various compositions, the in vitro growth of staph. aureus was inhibited, and the number of colonies of staph. aureus plated from the vagina of infected mice was significantly reduced.  the antibacterial activity of these strains separately and in compositions correlated with their ability to improve the performance of the immune response.  these strains were the most effective in the following compositions: lact. casei  imv b-7280-b. longum vk1-b. bifidum vk2. strains of lact. casei imv b-7280, lact. acidophilus imv b-7279, b. bifidum vk2, and b. longum vk1 are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis and for immunity correction.

TI  == effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  == patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. this can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) tube. enteral nutrition (en) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. a continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of en patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus dun-311, bifidobacterium bifidum bb-02, bifidobacterium lactis bl-01, synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. a peg tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. the synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (sssm) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after peg tube insertion. the synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on peg tube surfaces, with suppression of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to peg insertion. when synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to peg insertion, colonization by staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and candida famata was also inhibited. lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (sssm). these results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on peg tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == cdna sequence and expression analysis of an antimicrobial peptide, theromacin, in the triangle-shell pearl mussel hyriopsis cumingii.
AB  == bivalve molluscs rely on the interaction between cellular and humoral factors for protection against potential pathogens. antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been proven to be one of the most important humoral components that afford resistance  to pathogen infection. the amp gene to be identified was that encoding theromacin in the triangle-shell pearl mussel hyriopsis cumingii (hc theromacin); this gene  was identified from a suppression subtractive hybridization library, and subsequently cloned by 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends polymerase chain reaction (race-pcr). the full-length theromacin cdna contains 547 bp, with  a 294-bp open reading frame that encodes a 97-amino acid peptide, and the deduced peptide sequence contains a 61-amino acid putative mature peptide. the sequence also contains 10 cysteine residues. reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr analysis showed that hc theromacin transcripts were constitutively expressed in the liver, foot, gill, adductor muscle, heart, mantle, intestine, and hemocytes, with the highest level in hemocytes. theromacin mrna levels were found to increase after challenge with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. after injection of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium bifidum, hc theromacin expression showed the highest fold-change at 48 and 36 h after infection, respectively, and its levels decreased gradually thereafter.

TI  == production of bioactive human alpha-defensin 5 in pichia pastoris.
AB  == human alpha-defensin 5 (hd5), a small cationic peptide, is expressed in paneth cell granules of small intestinal crypts. hd5 exhibits high antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. in this study, the constitutive expression of hd5 antimicrobial peptide was achieved using the methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris (p. pastoris). hd5 cdna was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using human lung cell cdna as template. the 96-bp dna fragment encoding mature hd5 peptide (amino acid 63-94) was subcloned into the yeast expression vector and transfected into p. pastoris x-33 expression host by electroporation. the recombinant hd5 (rhd5) was detected in the supernatant of transfected yeast by western blot analysis. the recombinant hd5 crude extract from transfected p. pastoris showed antimicrobial activities against salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus and pathogenic e. coli. however, rhd5 did not inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium  bifidum, or b. longum. these results indicated that the rhd5 expressed in p. pastoris selectively inhibited the growth of specific bacteria.

TI  == [influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  == aim: to assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. materials and methods: six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and rhodotorula rubra isolated  by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. in order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria  for obtaining the control samples. formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. results: performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. changes of these characteristics was observed both in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as  well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. conclusion: obtained data open perspective  for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.

TI  == dynamics of bacterial community in solid-state fermented feed revealed by 16s rrna.
AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in the composition  of microbiota in solid-state fermented feed and to evaluate their biosafety. methods and results: in the solid-state fermentation, six probiotic bacteria strains were used as inoculum and soybean meal were used as carbohydrate source.  at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 days, samples were collected for further analysis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis showed that bifidobacterium bifidum and bacillus licheniformis were always present throughout the fermentation. bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus acidophilum were dominant throughout the entire fermentation as monitored by lactobacillus-specific pcr-dgge. probiotics supplementation could reduce the levels of the pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) by species-specific real-time pcr. and salmonella spp. was not detected throughout the entire fermentation. conclusions: probiotics supplemented are always dominant throughout the whole period of solid-state fermentation and effective in preventing the growth of pathogens. significance and impact of the study: based on the results, the high quality, stable solid-state fermented feed could be produced and applied in the pigs to improve the animal performances.

TI  == in vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  == camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. the present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. green tea extract-4 (csi-4) with the maximum yield  of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. it showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens helicobacter pylori, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/ml. csi-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the ic(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/ml. it exhibited the highest activity against p. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that csi-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.

TI  == selection of probiotic bacteria for prevention of allergic diseases: immunomodulation of neonatal dendritic cells.
AB  == modification of intestinal microbiota early in life by administration of probiotic bacteria may be a potential approach to prevent allergic disease. to select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes, we investigated the capacity of probiotic bacteria to interact with neonatal dendritic cells (dc) and studied the ensuing t cell polarizing effect. immature dc were generated from cord blood-derived monocytes and maturation was induced by maturation factors (mf), lipopolysaccharide (lps) plus mf and bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, lactobacillus salivarius, lactococcus lactis alone or combined with mf. after 12  days of co-culture with dc and staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb) as antigenic stimulus, cytokine production by autologous t cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining. additionally, cells were stimulated with cd3 and cd28 monoclonal antibodies and cytokines were measured in supernatants by multiplex assay. the probiotic strains induced partial maturation of dc. full maturation of dc was induced for all strains tested when mf was added. the percentage of interleukin (il)-4 producing t cells was lower in t cell cultures stimulated with b. bifidum matured dc compared to mf and lps matured dc, which coincided with a higher percentage of interferon (ifn)-gamma-producing t cells. furthermore, t cells stimulated by b. bifidum matured dc produced significantly more il-10 compared to mf matured dc. selected species of the bifidobacterium genus prime in vitro cultured neonatal dc to polarize t cell responses and may therefore be candidates to use in primary prevention of allergic diseases.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == [antibacterial effects of water-soluble low-molecular-weight chitosans on different microorganisms].
AB  == low-molecular-weight chitosans with a viscosity-average molecular weight (mv) of  5 to 27 kda and equal degree of deacetylation (dd, 85%) were highly active against pseudomonas aureofaciens, enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus subtilis, and bifidobacterium bifidum 791, causing death of 80 to 100% of cells. an exception to this tendency was escherichia coli, for which the rate of cell death, induced by the 5-kda chitosan, was 38%. the antibacterial effect was manifested as early as 10 min after incubation of 12-kda chitosan with b. subtilis or e. coli cells. candida krusei was almost insensitive to the above crab chitosans. however, candida krusei was highly sensitive to chitosans with mv 5, 6, 12, 15.7, and 27 kda: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) varied from 0.06 to 0.005%. chitosans with m, 5, 12, and 15.7 kda exerted an antibacterial effect on staphylococcus aureus. chitosans with mv 5, 15.7, and 27  kda had no effect on bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 14893. the antibacterial effect of the 4-kda chitosan on e. coli and b. bifidum 791 increased with dd in the range 55-85%.

AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a pcr-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  == we developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. one specific primer, lblma1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16s and 23s rrna genes in a number of lactobacillus strains. amplification with lblma1-rev and r16-1, a universal primer, generated a pcr product for 23 lactobacillus species. electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus, carnobacterium pissicola,  pediococcus pentosaceus, bifidobacterium bifidum, weissella confusa, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus or listeria monocytogenes dna were used as template.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == [the manifestation of functional heterogeneity of the peptidoglycans in opsonophagocytic reactions].
AB  == the peptidoglycan activity of staphylococcus aureus ccm 885 and bifidobacterium bifidum 1 was studied in the opsonophagocytic system on the basis of the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of human neutrophils. b. bifidum peptidoglycan was more active in direct interaction with neutrophils. after treatment with normal human serum s. aureus peptidoglycan showed more pronounced  neutrophil-stimulating properties. this phenomenon was in accord with a higher content of igg antibodies to s. aureus peptidoglycan, as well as with its capacity for the classical direct activation of the complement. moreover, in reactions with s. aureus peptidoglycan "minor" opsonins, independent of antibodies and complement, were detected. b. bifidum peptidoglycan did not activate the complement, could not be opsonized with the serum having no specific antibodies and did not react with "minor" opsonins.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == [the effect of phospholipids on the adhesive properties of bacteria].
AB  == the present work shows that choline-containing phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-1-alkyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) inhibit the adhesion of some strains: bacterium bifidum 1, b. adolescentis mc-42, b. longum b. 379m, staphylococcus aureus p 209 and klebsiella pneumoniae 52. phosphatidylcholine produces no effect on the adhesiveness of these strains, while platelet activation factor stimulates adhesiveness only in strain s. aureus 209. the stimulating or inhibiting action of phospholipids on the adhesive process of microorganisms depends on the species of bacteria and on the concentration of reagents.

TI  == [the characteristics of staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan in the spectrum of the reactivity of human lymphocytes to bacterial peptidoglycans].
AB  == the sensitivity of lymphocytes of healthy persons to s. aureus peptidoglycan as compared with that to the polyclonal stimulator zymosan c3b and peptidoglycans of other bacteria (streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, bacterium bifidum) was  analyzed with a test system permitting the determination of specific reactivity to peptidoglycans. the analysis showed that at the peak of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (25-30 minutes) individual reactivity to s. aureus peptidoglycan varied within wide limits (the coefficient of lymphocyte stimulation was 1.4-9.6, 3.5 +/- 0.6), exceeding sensitivity to other bacteria, as well as the values obtained in the negative control. the conclusion of the wide spread of sensitization to s. aureus peptidoglycan and the possibility of using this preparation for the study of cell-mediated immunity reactions was made.

TI  == [the range of antigenic specificity of bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic relationships of bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (lva-3, 791, go-4), bifidobacteria of other species (b. adolescentis go-13, b. breve 79-38, b. lactentis 79-41, b. longum go-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (streptococcus faecalis 6-3. staphylococcus aureus com 885, s. epidermidis com 2124. lactobacillus plantarum 1, escherichia coli m-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans.  the level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to l. plantarum and e. coli was considerably less pronounced. copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, s. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.

TI  == [prevention of dysbacteriosis in the early neonatal period using a pure culture of acidophilic bacteria].
AB  == in order to prevent dysbacterioses occurring in the early neonatal period, 60 neonates classified with the risk group were administered, when they were still at the puerperal room, pure cultures of specially selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus possessing marked anti-klebsiella activity and antagonistic activity against staphylococcus aureus. the cultures were instilled  into the mouth and nasal passages. forty neonates administered bifidum-bacterin and 54 neonates not given biopreparations were used as control. application of the pure culture of lactobacillus acidophilus noticeably raised the efficacy of the preventive measures. over 60 percent of the neonates were discharged from the maternity home with a normally formed intestinal microflora, 60 percent had normal microflora in the fauces, 80 percent in the nose, and 70 percent of the neonates demonstrated normal skin microflora. the carriage of opportunistic microorganisms in the fauces and nose of the neonates had decreased substantially by the time of the discharge from the maternity home, while the incidence of pyo-inflammatory diseases had also reduced among them.
