TI  == an internal thioester in a pathogen surface protein mediates covalent host binding.
AB  == to cause disease and persist in a host, pathogenic and commensal microbes must adhere to tissues. colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. to date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. here we show that the streptococcal surface protein sfbi mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a 'chemical harpoon'. this cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and sfbi binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle  in host-microbe interactions. this represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering  beneficial interactions.

TI  == c-terminal clostridium perfringens enterotoxin-mediated antigen delivery for nasal pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  == efficient vaccine delivery to mucosal tissues including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues is essential for the development of mucosal vaccine. we previously reported that claudin-4 was highly expressed on the epithelium of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (nalt) and thus claudin-4-targeting using  c-terminal fragment of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (c-cpe) effectively delivered fused antigen to nalt and consequently induced antigen-specific immune  responses. in this study, we applied the c-cpe-based vaccine delivery system to develop a nasal pneumococcal vaccine. we fused c-cpe with pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa), an important antigen for the induction of protective immunity against streptococcus pneumoniae infection, (pspa-c-cpe). pspa-c-cpe binds to claudin-4 and thus efficiently attaches to nalt epithelium, including antigen-sampling m cells. nasal immunization with pspa-c-cpe induced pspa-specific igg in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) as well as iga in the nasal wash and balf. these immune responses were sufficient to protect against pneumococcal infection. these results suggest that c-cpe is an efficient  vaccine delivery system for the development of nasal vaccines against pneumococcal infection.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == synthesis of 4-methylumbelliferyl alpha-d-mannopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-d-mannopyranoside and development of a coupled fluorescent assay for gh125 exo-alpha-1,6-mannosidases.
AB  == certain bacterial pathogens possess a repertoire of carbohydrate processing enzymes that process host n-linked glycans and many of these enzymes are required for full virulence of harmful human pathogens such as clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pneumoniae. one bacterial carbohydrate processing enzyme that has been studied is the pneumococcal virulence factor spgh125 from s. pneumoniae and  its homologue, cpgh125, from c. perfringens. these exo-alpha-1,6-mannosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 125 show poor activity toward aryl alpha-mannopyranosides. to circumvent this problem, we describe a convenient synthesis of the fluorogenic disaccharide substrate 4-methylumbelliferone alpha-d-mannopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-d-mannopyranoside. we show this substrate can be used in a coupled fluorescent assay by using beta-mannosidases from either cellulomonas fimi or helix pomatia as the coupling enzyme. we find that this disaccharide substrate is processed much more efficiently than aryl alpha-mannopyranosides by cpgh125, most likely because inclusion of the second mannose residue makes this substrate more like the natural host glycan substrates of this enzyme, which enables it to bind better. using this sensitive coupled assay, the detailed characterization of these metal-independent exo-alpha-mannosidases gh125 enzymes should be possible, as should screening chemical libraries for inhibitors of these virulence factors.

TI  == bacteria and their toxins tamed for immunotherapy.
AB  == bacterial toxins share the ability to enter host cells to target various intracellular proteins and to modulate host immune responses. over the last 20 years, toxins and their mutated variants, as well as live attenuated bacteria, have been exploited for vaccination and immunotherapy of various infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases. the ability of bordetella pertussis adenylate  cyclase toxin to translocate its adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane, as well as the pathways of intracellular trafficking of bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins, shigella dysenteriae shiga toxin or escherichia coli shiga-like toxin, have been repeatedly exploited for the delivery of antigenic epitopes into host cells and for stimulation of antigen-specific t cell responses. similarly, e. coli alpha-hemolysin, or effector proteins of yersinia and salmonella secreted by the type iii secretion systems, were used to facilitate the delivery of fused heterologous proteins or peptides for antigenic presentation. vibrio cholerae cholera toxin, e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, b. pertussis pertussis toxin or the cry1a protein of bacillus thuringiensis have shown a great potential to act as adjuvants and to stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. the immunotherapeutic potential of some toxins, like clostridium perfringens perfringolysin o, streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin, or streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin needs to be evaluated further. the bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid used as a  vaccine delivery tool, or corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a-based immunotoxins, are currently in various phases of clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy, as are some antigen-delivering salmonella and listeria monocytogenes strains.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == analysis of a new family of widely distributed metal-independent alpha-mannosidases provides unique insight into the processing of n-linked glycans.
AB  == the modification of n-glycans by alpha-mannosidases is a process that is relevant to a large number of biologically important processes, including infection by microbial pathogens and colonization by microbial symbionts. at present, the described mannosidases specific for alpha1,6-mannose linkages are very limited in number. through structural and functional analysis of two sequence-related enzymes, one from streptococcus pneumoniae (spgh125) and one from clostridium perfringens (cpgh125), a new glycoside hydrolase family, gh125, is identified and characterized. analysis of spgh125 and cpgh125 reveal them to have exo-alpha1,6-mannosidase activity consistent with specificity for n-linked glycans having their alpha1,3-mannose branches removed. the x-ray crystal structures of spgh125 and cpgh125 obtained in apo-, inhibitor-bound, and substrate-bound forms provide both mechanistic and molecular insight into how these proteins, which adopt an (alpha/alpha)(6)-fold, recognize and hydrolyze the alpha1,6-mannosidic bond by an inverting, metal-independent catalytic mechanism.  a phylogenetic analysis of gh125 proteins reveals this to be a relatively large and widespread family found frequently in bacterial pathogens, bacterial human gut symbionts, and a variety of fungi. based on these studies we predict this family of enzymes will primarily comprise such exo-alpha1,6-mannosidases.

TI  == effects of depletion of rna-binding protein tex on the expression of toxin genes  in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == tex was originally identified in bordetella pertussis, where it serves as a transcriptional regulator of toxin genes. however, the tex of streptococcus pneumoniae has no regulatory function in the expression of the pneumococcal major toxin pneumolysin. here, we identified the cpe2168 gene as tex in clostridium perfringens, and examined the roles of tex in toxin gene expression. we found that the deletion mutant for tex does not affect growth, but the mrna levels of three hyaluronidase genes (nagh, nagj, and nagl) and an exo-sialidase (nanj) were reduced to less than 50% as compared to the parent strain, c. perfringens strain  13. on the other hand, tex did not affect the expression of proteases, enterotoxins, hemolysins, either of two hyaluronidase genes (nagi and nagk), an exo-sialidase (nani), or adhesins. moreover, purified tex bound to the 5'-portion of target gene mrnas. based on these results, we propose that tex positively regulates the gene expression of a set of toxin genes in c. perfringens.

TI  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. the activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. an overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of cdcs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. the way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (macpf) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. in this chapter i aim to provide an overview  of our understanding of the interaction between cdcs and other members of what is now called the macpf/cdc superfamily, with their target membranes. cdcs (also in  the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four gram-positive bacterial genera (clostridium, listeria, bacillus and streptococcus). well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. listeriolysin from l. monocytogenes  is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. perfringolysin from c. perfringens (fig. 1a) has become perhaps the most studied cdc4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). streptolysin from s. pyogenes is another intensely studied cdc and has been applied widely in  experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for s. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. however, cdcs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria arcanobacterium pyogenes and gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. the homology with the macpf family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic macpf/cdc fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (fig. 1a and d). without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. the glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that cdcs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. while not all macpf domains are involved in pore formation-for example, c6 and c8beta--they are all apparently involved in action  on membranes. the dramatic refolding undergone by cdcs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the macpf/cdc domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (fig. 1a-c). it is obviously the basic assumption that  where noncdc members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 even where a member of the macpf/cdc superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. however, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another macpf/cdc family member or members from the same specific system. complement acts by a combination of the c5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting c9 to form a lesion, which may be a  complete ring of c9 associated with the c5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.

TI  == standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, pvp-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  == background: this study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics pvp-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and  polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. methods: mics and mbcs were determined in accordance with din 58940-7 and 58940-8 using staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, haemophilus influenzae and candida albicans. the microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with din en 1040 and 1275 using s. aureus,  p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. results: for chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, mic(48) and mbc(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l. maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/l, with an efficacy gap against p. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of pvp-iodine were 1024 mg/l, with a gap against s. pneumoniae. comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. after 1 min, only octenidine and pvp-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. conclusions: tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. when a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine >  chlorhexidine > triclosan > pvp-iodine. this is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. if an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = pvp-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

TI  == types of infectious outbreaks and their impact in elderly care facilities: a review of the literature.
AB  == background: infectious outbreaks in long-term care facilities (ltcfs) tend to have a significant impact on infection rates and mortality rates of the residents. objectives: this review aimed to update the information on pathogens identified in such outbreaks and to try to explore indicators that reflect the impact of outbreaks among residents and health care workers (hcws). methods: medline (1966-2008) was used to identify outbreaks using the following thesaurus  terms: 'cross-infection', 'disease outbreaks', 'urinary-tract infections' and 'blood-borne pathogens'. elderly care facilities were identified with the following thesaurus terms: 'long-term care', 'assisted-living facilities', 'homes for the aged' and 'nursing homes'. age category was limited using 'aged'. results: thirty-seven pathogens were associated with 206 outbreaks. the largest number of reported outbreaks by a single pathogen involved the influenza virus, followed by noroviruses. among residents, the highest median attack rate for respiratory infection outbreaks was caused by chlamydia pneumoniae (46%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (40%). in gastrointestinal tract infection outbreaks, high median attack rates were caused by clostridium perfringens (48%) and noroviruses (45%). outbreaks with high median case fatality rates were caused by group a streptococci (50%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (44%). high median attack rates for hcws were caused by c. pneumoniae (41%), noroviruses (42%) and scabies (36%). conclusion: a variety of infectious agents were identified as the cause of outbreaks in the elderly and hcws in ltcfs. attack rates and case fatality rates are useful indicators for setting priorities for education and prevention of the outbreaks.

TI  == bsac standardized disc susceptibility testing method (version 8).
AB  == there have been considerable changes to the format of the recommendations since the previous version (version 7). the majority of the footnotes to the tables have been removed and the notations added to the end column; it is hoped that this change will avoid confusion in interpretation. antibiotics have been separated into groups, e.g. beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, etc. recommendations for urinary tract infections (utis) have been removed for most agents except for  those that are administered solely for the treatment of uncomplicated utis or where there are limited recommendations for specific organisms, e.g. trimethoprim. for agents that previously had dual recommendations, systemic recommendations remain and the intermediate category can be used for interpretation for utis because intermediate susceptibility infers that the infection may respond as the agent is concentrated at the site of infection. this change will also avoid errors in interpretation when an organism is isolated from multiple sites, e.g. blood and urine. the changes that have been made to version  7 are as follows: mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for trimethoprim, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin for utis (table 7); mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for doripenem (tables 7-9); colistin mic bps for pseudomonas spp. (table 9), co-trimoxazole mic bps for stenotrophomonas maltophilia (table 10); staphylococci mic and zone diameter bps for clarithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, trimethoprim uti, nitrofurantoin uti and rifampicin (table 11); streptococcus pneumoniae mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, linezolid, rifampicin and telithromycin (table 12); addition of streptomycin recommendations for enterococci (table 13); enterococcal mic and zone diameter bps for quinupristin/dalfopristin, nitrofurantoin uti and trimethoprim uti (table 13); beta-haemolytic streptococci mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and telithromycin (table 15); clarithromycin and erythromycin mic and zone diameter bps for moraxella catarrhalis (table 16); azithromycin mic bps for neisseria gonorrhoeae (table 17); chloramphenicol and rifampicin mic bps for neisseria meningitidis (table 18); azithromycin mic bps for haemophilus influenzae (table 19); mic bps for metronidazole for bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and clostridium perfringens (tables 23-25, respectively); susceptibility testing of listeria spp. (appendix 3); the acceptable range for atcc 25923 to a 10 microg tobramycin disc (table 26).

AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == diversifying and stabilizing selection of sialidase and n-acetylneuraminate catabolism in mycoplasma synoviae.
AB  == sialidase activity varies widely among strains and tends to correlate with strain virulence in the avian pathogen mycoplasma synoviae. to characterize the forms of selection acting on enzymes required for sialic acid scavenging and catabolism, the ratios of nonsynonymous (k(a)) to synonymous (k(s)) mutation frequency were calculated for codons in the sialidase gene of 16 strains of m. synoviae and for  its nearly identical homolog in four strains of mycoplasma gallisepticum. the k(a)/k(s) (omega) values for the linked genes required for nutritive n-acetylneuraminate catabolism (nana, nagc, nane, naga, and nagb) from nine strains of m. synoviae were also determined. to provide context, omega was determined for all corresponding genes of 26 strains of clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pneumoniae. bayesian models of sequence evolution showed that only the sialidase of m. synoviae was under significant (p < 0.001) diversifying  selection, while the m. synoviae genes for n-acetylneuraminate catabolism and all genes examined from m. gallisepticum, c. perfringens, and s. pneumoniae were under neutral to stabilizing selection. diversifying selection acting on the sialidase of m. synoviae, but not on the sialidase of m. gallisepticum or the sialidases or other enzymes essential for sialic acid scavenging in other firmicutes, is evidence that variation in specific activity of the enzyme is perpetuated by a nonnutritive function in m. synoviae that is influenced by the genomic context of the organism.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == histone modifications induced by a family of bacterial toxins.
AB  == upon infection, pathogens reprogram host gene expression. in eukaryotic cells, genetic reprogramming is induced by the concerted activation/repression of transcription factors and various histone modifications that control dna accessibility in chromatin. we report here that the bacterial pathogen listeria monocytogenes induces a dramatic dephosphorylation of histone h3 as well as a deacetylation of histone h4 during early phases of infection. this effect is mediated by the major listerial toxin listeriolysin o in a pore-forming-independent manner. strikingly, a similar effect also is observed with other toxins of the same family, such as clostridium perfringens perfringolysin and streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin. the decreased levels of  histone modifications correlate with a reduced transcriptional activity of a subset of host genes, including key immunity genes. thus, control of epigenetic regulation emerges here as an unsuspected function shared by several bacterial toxins, highlighting a common strategy used by intracellular and extracellular pathogens to modulate the host response early during infection.

AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

AB  == the spore forming bacterium clostridium perfringens is a widely occurring pathogen. vaccines against c. perfringens type b and c are currently manufactured using beta-toxin secreted by virulent c. perfringens strains. large-scale production of vaccines from virulent strains requires stringent safety conditions and costly detoxification and control steps. therefore, it would be beneficial to produce this toxin in a safe production host and in an immunogenic, but non-toxic form (toxoid). for high-level expression of beta-toxoid, we cloned the highly active ribosomal rpsf promoter of bacillus subtilis in a broad host range multicopy plasmid. in b. subtilis, we obtained high intracellular production, up  to 200 microg ml(-1) culture. however, the beta-toxoid was poorly secreted. the employed rpsf expression system allowed using the same expression plasmids in other heterologous hosts such as lactococcus lactis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in these organisms secretion of beta-toxoid was ten times higher compared to the  best producing b. subtilis strain. these results show the usefulness of the rpsf  based broad host range expression system.

TI  == characterization of a carbohydrate epitope defined by the monoclonal antibody h185: sialic acid o-acetylation on epithelial cell-surface mucins.
AB  == sialic acids comprise a large family of derivatives of neuraminic acid containing methyl, acetyl, sulfate, and phosphate among other groups, which confer specific  physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and resistance to hydrolases) to the molecules carrying them. several years ago, a monoclonal antibody, designated h185, was developed, which binds to cell membranes of human corneal, conjunctival, laryngeal, and vaginal epithelia and whose distribution is altered  on the ocular surface of patients with keratinizing disease. recent findings using immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion techniques have demonstrated that,  in human corneal epithelial cells, the h185 antigen is carried by the membrane-associated mucin muc16. in this study, we show that the h185 epitope on  human corneal cells and in tear fluid is an o-acetylated sialic acid epitope that can be selectively hydrolyzed in an enzyme-concentration-dependent manner by sialidase from arthrobacter ureafaciens and to a lesser extent by sialidases from newcastle disease virus, clostridium perfringens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. binding of the h185 antibody was impaired by treatment of tear fluid with a recombinant 9-o-acetylesterase from influenza c virus. two o-acetyl derivatives,  neu5,7ac(2) and neu5,9ac(2), were identified in human tear fluid by fluorometric  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and electrospray mass spectrometry  (ms). immunoprecipitation of the h185 epitope from human corneal epithelial cells revealed that neu5,9ac(2) was the major derivative on the mucin isolate. these results indicate that exposed wet-surfaced epithelia are decorated with o-acetyl  sialic acid derivatives on membrane-associated mucins and suggest that o-acetylation on cell surfaces may protect against pathogen infection by preventing degradation of membrane-associated mucins.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bact/alert 3d and bactec systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  == objective: to compare bact/alert (bta) and bactec 9240 (bac), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. materials and methods:  blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented bta and bac standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. the time to growth detection (td) was recorded for each bottle that became positive.  a quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess td of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. results: a total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both bta and bac bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by bta bottles and 13 (56.5%) by bac. proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the bta system. the average tds were 19.0 and 24.6 h for bta and bac, respectively. analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same  for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa but slightly different for haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the anaerobic  bottle ofthe bta did not support the growth of h. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/ml whereas the bac did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml. td for  s. pneumoniae in the bta was about half of that in the bac. conclusions: the bta  system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the bac system to detect the same organism.

TI  == identification and molecular cloning of a novel glycoside hydrolase family of core 1 type o-glycan-specific endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == we found endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase in most bifidobacterial strains, which are predominant bacteria in the human colon. this enzyme catalyzes the liberation of galactosyl beta1,3-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galbeta1,3galnac) alpha-linked to serine or threonine residues from mucin-type glycoproteins. the gene (engbf) encoding the enzyme has been cloned from bifidobacterium longum jcm  1217. the protein consisted of 1,966 amino acid residues, and the central domain  (590-1381 amino acid residues) exhibited 31-53% identity to hypothetical proteins of several bacteria including clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pneumoniae. the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli liberated galbeta1,3galnac disaccharide from galbeta1,3galnacalpha1pnp and asialofetuin, but did not release galnac, galbeta1,3(glcnacbeta1,6)galnac, glcnacbeta1,3galnac, and galbeta1,3glcnac from each p-nitrophenyl (pnp) substrate, and also did not release sialo-oligosaccharides from fetuin, indicating its strict substrate specificity for the core 1-type structure. the stereochemical course of hydrolysis was determined by (1)h nmr and was found to be retention. site-directed mutagenesis of a total of 22 conserved asp and glu residues suggested that asp-682 and asp-789 are critical residues for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. the enzyme also exhibited transglycosylation activity toward various mono- and disaccharides and 1-alkanols, demonstrating its potential to synthesize neoglycoconjugates. this is the first report for the isolation of a gene encoding endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from any organisms and for the establishment of a new glycoside hydrolase family (gh family 101).

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. one  of the bacteria isolated, a strain of bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an  anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the c. perfringens atcc 13124 used in this study. the anticlostridial factor produced by b. subtilis pb6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. in contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees c or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. the optimum growth temperature and optimum ph for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees c and 6.20, respectively. using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the  range from 960 to 983 da. in terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of c. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, clostridium difficile, streptococcus pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli.

TI  == identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of streptococcus suis.
AB  == in our continued effort to search for a streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of s. suis type 2. a clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized  within a 2.0-kbp ecori dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kda. by in vitro protein synthesis and western  blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kda. at the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from streptococcus pneumoniae (89%),  streptococcus mutans (86%), lactococcus lactis (80%), listeria monocytogenes (74%), and clostridium perfringens (64%). except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in  strains of other s. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the ecori recognition sequence. we confirmed expression of the 38-kda protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. the recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of s. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most s. suis infections. pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kda protein mounted antibody responses to  the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of s. suis type 2, suggesting  that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against s. suis infection. analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. the functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic s. suis capsular  types remains to be determined.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == the solution structure and oligomerization behavior of two bacterial toxins: pneumolysin and perfringolysin o.
AB  == pneumolysin (ply), an important protein virulence factor of the human bacterial pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae, could be a candidate for inclusion in a new anti-streptococcal vaccine. ply solution species from monomer via multimeric intermediates to ring-shaped oligomers were studied with time-dependent sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge (auc). hydrodynamic bead modeling was used to interpret the data obtained. ply remained mostly monomeric in solution; intermediate ply multimers were detected in small quantities. current understanding of ply molecular mechanism is guided by a model built on the basis of its homology with perfringolysin o (pfo) for which there is an atomic structure. pfo, a virulence factor of the organism clostridium perfringens, has almost the same molecular mass as ply and shares 48% sequence identity and 60% sequence similarity with ply. we report a comparative low-resolution structural study of ply and pfo using auc and small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs). auc data demonstrate that both proteins in solution are mostly monodisperse but ply is a monomer whereas pfo is mostly dimeric. ab initio dummy  atom and dummy residue models for pfo and ply were restored from the distance distribution function derived from experimental small-angle x-ray scattering curves. in solution, ply is elongated, consistent with the shape predicted by its high-resolution homology model. the pfo dimer is also an elongated particle whose shape and volume are consistent with a staggered antiparallel dimer.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of the human-specific toxin intermedilysin.
AB  == intermedilysin is a human-specific toxin from streptococcus intermedius, which is part of normal human oral flora. the bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen with  a tendency for deep-seated infection in the brain and liver. intermedilysin belongs to the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdcs) family of toxins, which have been identified in several different bacteria including the serious human pathogens s. pneumoniae and clostridium perfringens. intermedilysin, however, is  the only member that shows exclusive specificity for human cells. the toxin has a couple of non-conservative amino-acid substitutions in a tryptophan-rich region of the molecule (cys to ala and trp to pro), the most conserved region amongst the cdcs. mutations in this region are known to render other cdcs inactive. in order to investigate the structure-function relationships of the unusual features of intermedilysin, which will help us to understand the molecular mechanism of the toxin family in general, recombinant intermedilysin has been crystallized. the crystals belong to an orthorhombic space group and contain two molecules per  asymmetric unit. diffraction data were collected to 2.3 a using synchrotron radiation.

(asteraceae) were investigated. gc-ms analysis of the essential oil resulted in the identification of 36 compounds constituting 90.8% of the total oil. eucalyptol, camphor, alpha-terpineol, beta-pinene, and borneol were the principal components  comprising 60.7% of the oil. the oil strongly reduced the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl  radical (ic(50)=1.56 micro g/ml) and exhibited hydroxyl radical scavenging effect in the fe(3+)-edta-h(2)o(2) deoxyribose system (ic(50)=2.7 micro g/ml). it also inhibited the nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation of rat liver homogenate (ic(50)=13.5 micro g/ml). the polar phase of the extract showed antioxidant activity. the oil showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, mycobacterium smegmatis, acinetobacter lwoffii and candida krusei while water-insoluble parts of the methanolic extracts exhibited slight or no activity. this study confirms that the essential oil of achillea millefolium possesses antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

TI  == horizontal transfer of drug-resistant aminoacyl-transfer-rna synthetases of anthrax and gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the screening of new antibiotics against several bacterial strains often reveals  unexpected occurrences of natural drug resistance. two examples of this involve specific inhibitors of staphylococcus aureus isoleucyl-transfer-rna synthetase 1  (ilers1) and, more recently, streptococcus pneumoniae methionyl-trna synthetase 1 (metrs1). in both cases, resistance is due to the presence of a second gene that  encodes another synthetase (ilers2 or metrs2). here, we show that both s. pneumoniae metrs2 and s. aureus ilers2 have closely related homologues in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. furthermore, similar to drug-resistant pathogens, strains of b. anthracis and its closest relative, b. cereus, also have wild-type iles1 and mets1 genes. clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gangrene, also has two mets genes, whereas oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from deep-sea sediments has a single iles2-type gene. this study shows the importance of understanding complex  evolutionary networks of ancient horizontal gene transfer for the development of  novel antibiotics.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  == enzymatic alpha 2,3-sialylation of galnac has not been described previously, although some glycoconjugates containing alpha 2,3-sialylated galnac residues have been reported. in the present experiments, recombinant soluble alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase st3gal ii efficiently sialylated the x(2) pentasaccharide galnac beta 1-3gal beta 1-4glcnac beta 1-3gal beta 1-4glc, globo-n-tetraose galnac beta 1-3gal alpha 1-4gal beta 1-4glc, and the disaccharide galnac beta 1-3gal in vitro. the purified products were identified as neu5ac alpha 2-3galnac  beta 1-3gal beta 1-4glcnac beta 1-3gal beta 1-4glc, neu5ac alpha 2-3galnac beta 1-3gal alpha 1-4gal beta 1-4glc, and neu5ac alpha 2-3galnac beta 1-3gal, respectively, by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass  spectrometry, enzymatic degradations, and one- and two-dimensional nmr-spectroscopy. in particular, the presence of the neu5ac alpha 2-3galnac linkage was firmly established in all three products by a long range correlation  between neu5ac c2 and galnac h3 in heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectra. collectively, the data describe the first successful sialyltransfer reactions to the 3-position of galnac in any acceptor. previously, st3gal ii has  been shown to transfer to the gal beta 1-3galnac determinant. consequently, the present data show that the enzyme is multifunctional, and could be renamed st3gal(nac) ii. in contrast to st3gal ii, st3gal iii did not transfer to the x(2) pentasaccharide. the neu5ac alpha 2-3galnac linkage of sialyl x(2) was cleaved by sialidases from arthrobacter ureafaciens and clostridium perfringens, but resisted the action of sialidases from newcastle disease virus and streptococcus  pneumoniae. therefore, the latter two enzymes cannot be used to differentiate between neu5ac alpha 2-3galnac and neu5ac alpha 2-6galnac linkages, as has been assumed previously.

AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == structural basis of pore formation by cholesterol-binding toxins.
AB  == in this paper we describe reconstructions by electron cryo-microscopy of two oligomeric states of the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin. the results are interpreted by the fitting of atomic models of separated domains to the 3-dimensional electron density maps, revealing two steps in the mechanism of pore formation by the family of cholesterol-binding toxins. we briefly describe the observation of the toxin pore in model membranes and contrast the apparent mechanism of pneumolysin with that of other pore-forming toxins.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == two structural transitions in membrane pore formation by pneumolysin, the pore-forming toxin of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae produces soluble pneumolysin monomers that bind host cell membranes to form ring-shaped, oligomeric pores. we have determined three-dimensional structures of a helical oligomer of pneumolysin and  of a membrane-bound ring form by cryo-electron microscopy. fitting the four domains from the crystal structure of the closely related perfringolysin reveals  major domain rotations during pore assembly. oligomerization results in the expulsion of domain 3 from its original position in the monomer. however, domain  3 reassociates with the other domains in the membrane pore form. the base of domain 4 contacts the bilayer, possibly along with an extension of domain 3. these results reveal a two-stage mechanism for pore formation by the cholesterol-binding toxins.

TI  == the molecular mechanism of pneumolysin, a virulence factor from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == pneumolysin, a member of the thiol-activated cytolysin family of toxins, is a virulence factor from the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. the toxin forms large oligomeric pores in cholesterol-containing membranes of eukaryotic cells. a plethora of biochemical and mutagenesis data have been published on pneumolysin, since its initial characterization in the 1930s. here we present an homology model of the monomeric and oligomeric forms of pneumolysin based on the recently determined crystal structure of perfringolysin o and electron microscopy data. a feature of the model is a striking electronegative surface on parts of pneumolysin that may reflect its cytosolic location in the bacterial cell. the models provide a molecular basis for understanding the effects of published mutagenesis and biochemical modifications on the toxic activity of pneumolysin. in addition, spectroscopic data are presented that shed  new light on pneumolysin activity and have guided us to hypothesise a detailed model of membrane insertion. these data show that the environment of some tryptophan residues changes on insertion and/or pore formation. in particular, spectroscopic analysis of a tryptophan mutant, w433f, suggests it is the residue  mainly responsible for the observed effects. furthermore, there is no change in the secondary structure content when the toxin inserts into membranes. finally, the basis of the very low activity shown by a pneumolysin molecule from another strain of s. pneumoniae may be due to the movements of a key domain-domain interface. the molecular basis of pneumolysin-induced complement activation may be related to the structural similarity of one of the domains of pneumolysin to fc, rather than the presumed homology of the toxin to c-reactive protein as previously suggested.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  == cs-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. this compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite r-95867. the antibacterial activity of r-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. r-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of  activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the  bacterial species tested. r-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, clostridium perfringens, neisseria spp., moraxella  catarrhalis, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae (mic at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). r-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteroides fragilis. r-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and escherichia coli. penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of s. aureus and 1bs, 2, 3, and 4 of e. coli had high affinities for r-95867. the in vivo efficacy of cs-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. the efficacy of cs-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, e. coli, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris. among the drugs tested, cs-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == new drugs--reports of new drugs recently approved by the fda. dirithromycin.
AB  == dirithromycin is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin, a 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic. the drug is converted during absorption and distribution, to an active metabolite 9-(s)-erythromycylamine, which is the predominant compound found in plasma and extravascular tissues. high tissue concentration of  erythromycylamine is achieved after oral doses of dirithromycin, with slow release back into the circulation. the mechanism of action of dirithromycin is like that of erythromycin and other macrolides. these compounds inhibit rna-dependent protein synthesis. it has recently been suggested that all macrolides stimulate dissociation of peptidyl-trna from ribosomes during the elongation phase, leading to inhibited protein synthesis. the antimicrobial spectrum of dirithromycin is similar to that of erythromycin, although the drug offers no significant advantage with regard to mic values. in vitro against gram-positive isolates, dirithromycin exhibits similar potency to that of clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and clindamycin. in vivo, dirithromycin is active against penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae. dirithromycin is as effective as penicillin vk against streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsilitis, and  as effective as erythromycin against acute superimposed chronic bronchitis and skin and soft-tissue infections. in comparison with other newer macrolides, dirithromycin has shown similar or lesser in vitro activity. in particular, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides spp., peptococcus-peptostreprococcus spp., clostridium perfringens, legionella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, and chlamydia trachomatis were all less sensitive to dirithromycin than azithromycin or clarithromycin. once-daily oral administration of dirithromycin (500 mg) has been demonstrated to be similar in efficacy to erythromycin (250 mg, 4 times daily), each for approximately 7 days, in the treatment of acute bronchitis or acute-exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in controlled studies. proven or presumed pathogen eradication rates were 83 and 86% for acute bronchitis patients treated with dirithromycin and erythromycin, respectively. corresponding bacteriological response rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were  75 to 84% with dirithromycin and 75 to 82% with erythromycin. both agents achieved clinical cure or improvement in over 85% of the patients with either condition. the main advantage of dirithromycin over erythromycin appears to be once-daily administration. lilly launched dirithromycin in september 1993, in spain, received approval from fda in august 1995, and launched it during october  1995.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. for comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. when tested against a higher inoculum or using the  broth dilution technique, the activity of bay v 3522 showed little dependence on  inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. clinical studies are thus warranted.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the gene for perfringolysin o (theta-toxin) from clostridium perfringens: significant homology with the genes for streptolysin o and pneumolysin.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence was determined for the gene encoding the thiol-activated  cytolysin, perfringolysin o (theta-toxin), from clostridium perfringens. the nucleotide-sequence-derived primary structure of perfringolysin o is 499 residues long and exhibits a 27-amino-acid signal peptide. the calculated molecular weight of the secreted (mature) form of perfringolysin o is 52,469. the deduced amino-terminal sequence of perfringolysin o is identical to that determined for purified perfringolysin o. hydropathy analysis indicated that, except for the signal peptide, no major stretches of hydrophobic residues are present. extensive amino acid sequence homology (65%) was detected with the low-molecular-weight form of streptolysin o, and a lesser amount (42%) was detected with pneumolysin.  the nucleotide sequence of the perfringolysin o gene (pfo) exhibits approximately 60% homology with the streptolysin o gene (slo) and 48% homology with the pneumolysin gene (ply). all three toxins contain an identical region of 12 amino  acids, which includes the essential cysteine of all three toxins. the location of these 12 residues was conserved in all three toxins when the primary sequences were aligned for maximum homology.

TI  == delayed postbacteremic prosthetic joint infection.
AB  == deep infection of a prosthetic joint is a devastating complication. one proposed  mechanism of late prosthetic joint infection involves hematogenous spread from an extraarticular focus of infection. two cases clearly demonstrate hematogenously acquired prosthetic joint infections, one caused by clostridium perfringens and the other by streptococcus pneumoniae. these cases were unusual in that a long asymptomatic period intervened between the primary bacteremic illness and the subsequent prosthetic infection. patients with prosthetic joints who develop bacteremic infection at extraarticular sites should be treated promptly and aggressively with appropriate antibiotics. prophylactic antibiotics should be strongly considered in the patient with a prosthetic joint who undergoes procedures likely to be associated with a bacteremia. transient arthralgias at the time of bacteremia may represent the onset of the joint infection and should  not be overlooked or attributed a priori to the patient's underlying arthritic or medical condition.

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

TI  == newcastle disease virus contains a linkage-specific glycoprotein sialidase. application to the localization of sialic acid residues in n-linked oligosaccharides of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.
AB  == newcastle disease virus sialidase was found to exhibit strict specificity for hydrolysis of the neuac alpha 2 leads to 3gal linkage contained in glycoprotein oligosaccharides both n-linked to asparagine and o-linked to threonine or serine  under conditions that left oligosaccharides containing the neuac alpha 2 leads to 2 leads to 6gal and neuac alpha 2 leads to 6gallnac linkages intact. this was determined, in part, by examining the viral sialidase for its ability to hydrolyze glycoprotein oligosaccharides derivatized with purified sialyltransferases to contain the [14c]neuac alpha 2 leads to 3gal, [14c]neuac alpha 2 leads to 6galnac, and [14c]neuac alpha 2 leads to 6gal linkages. the viral sialidase was also tested for hydrolysis of the neuac alpha 2 leads to 3gal and neuac alpha 2 leads to 6gal linkages on the n-linked oligosaccharides of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. selective hydrolysis of the neuac alpha 2 leads to 3gal linkage was shown by periodate oxidation and by 500-mhz 1h-nmr spectroscopy  of native and sialidase-treated glycopeptides. the nmr spectra, together with composition data, further indicated that the neuac alpha 2 leads to 3gal and neuac alpha 2 leads to 6gal linkages were localized to specific branches of the major tri- and tetraantennary oligosaccharides of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. the  results indicate that the newcastle disease virus sialidase can initiate the selective degradation of n-linked oligosaccharide branches containing the neuac alpha 2 leads to 3gal linkage.

AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  == using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group b beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group a strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes). among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested)  and proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: escherichia coli, salmonella, shigella, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis and bacteroides fragilis. therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.

TI  == bacteriology of the human biliary tract and the duodenum.
AB  == using the modern anaerobic transport media and meticulous culture techniques, 74  patients undergoing biliary tract surgery were studied. the biliary system was found to be sterile in 58 patients (78%). fifteen patients had 35 isolates of aerobic and facultative bacteria. the most common ones were klebsiella, enterococcus, and escherichia coli. the only anaerobe isolated was clostridium perfringens. eight of 17 patients (47%) with acute cholecystitis and five of 49 patients (10%) with chronic cholecystitis, harbored bacteria in the biliary system. this study suggests that anaerobes are rare in the human biliary system;  therefore, if antibiotic therapy is considered, aerobic coverage should suffice.

TI  == evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  == seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including culturette, trans-cul (with stuart and amies), handiswab, securline (with amies and amies without charcoal) and culture caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25c and 4c. the results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25c they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. no one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.

AB  == one hundred fifty-two strains of clostridium were isolated from 144 patients over a 14-month-peroid. these included 23 recognized species and 23 strains that were  unclassified. soft tissues or abscesses yielded 84 strains of clostridium. intraabdominal sites predominated, but clostridia were recovered from empyema, carcinoma, frostbite with gas gangrene, muscle abscess, aortic graft, and brain abscess. blood cultures yielded 65 strains of clostridium from 49 patients, representing 0.3% of 16,314 blood cultures (or 2.6% of 2,168 positive cultures).  clostridium perfringens was most common in blood, accounting for 37 isolates (57%). clostridial bacteremia was often unrelated to the clinical setting and was found in alcoholics with aspiration or streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, meningococcemia, and infantile gastroenteritis.  in 20 of the 49 patients (41%), aerobic or other anaerobic bacteria were cultured concurrently from the blood. thus, clostridial bacteremia should be interpreted with caution since there may be little correlation with the patient's clinical condition.

AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == an assay for intercellular adhesive specificity.
AB  == a modification of an assay for intercellular adhesive specificity is described. the method involves the collection of radioactively labeled cells by aggregates of the same (isotypic aggregates) or different (heterotypic aggregates) types of  tissue and determination of the number of cells collected by liquid scintillation counting. the use of (32)p to label the tissues permitted a much more rapid estimation of cell collection than was obtained previously. with the use of chick embryo neural retina, liver, forebrain, pectoral muscle, and heart ventricle tissue, it was shown that isotypic was always greater than heterotypic collection. labeled neural retina cell collection by neural retina aggregates was studied as a function of time, cell suspension density, aggregate diameter, temperature, and aggregate number. neural retina aggregates were treated with certain enzymes in an attempt to determine whether specific changes on the surface of the aggregates would interfere with labeled neural retina cell collection. of the various proteases and glycosidases tested, only beta-galactosidase rendered the surface more nonspecific.
