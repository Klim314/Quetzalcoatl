TI  == production of biologically active scfv and vhh antibody fragments in bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == bifidobacteria constitute a significant part of healthy intestinal microbiota in  adults and infants and present a promising platform for construction of genetically modified probiotic agents for treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. in this study, three strains of bifidobacterium longum were constructed that express and secrete biologically active single-chain antibodies  against human tnf-alpha and clostridium difficile exotoxin a. anti-tnf-alpha scfv antibody d2e7 was produced at the level of 25 mug l(-1) in broth culture and was  mostly retained in the cytoplasm, while vhh-type antibodies a20.1 and a26.8 against c. difficile exotoxin a were produced at the levels of 0.3-1 mg l(-1) and secreted very efficiently. the biological activity of both antibody types was demonstrated in the mammalian cell-based assays. expression of a20.1 and a26.8 was also observed in vivo after intragastric administration of transformed b. longum strains to (c57/bl6 x dba/2)f1 mice. the obtained b. longum strains may serve as prototypes for construction of novel probiotic medications against inflammatory bowel disease and c. difficile-associated disease.

TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == selective growth-inhibitory effect of 8-hydroxyquinoline towards clostridium difficile and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum in co-culture analysed by flow cytometry.
AB  == the major risk factor for clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is the use of antibiotics owing to the disruption of the equilibrium of the host gut microbiota. to preserve the beneficial resident probiotic bacteria during infection treatment, the use of molecules with selective antibacterial activity enhances the efficacy by selectively removing c. difficile. one of them is the plant alkaloid 8-hydroxyquinoline (8hq), which has been shown to selectively inhibit clostridia without repressing bifidobacteria. selective antimicrobial activity is generally tested by culture techniques of individual bacterial strains. however, the main limitation of these techniques is the inability to describe differential growth dynamics of more bacterial strains in co-culture within the same experiment. in the present study, we combined fluorescent in situ hybridization and flow cytometry to describe the changes in active and non-active cells of a mixed culture formed by the opportunistic pathogen c. difficile cect 531 and the beneficial bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum ccmdmnd bl1 after exposure to 8hq. it was observed that without 8hq, the proportion of both strains was almost equal, oscillating between 22.7 and 77.9 % during a time lapse of 12 h, whereas with 8hq the proportion of active c. difficile decreased after 4 h, and persisted only between 8.8 and 17.5 %. in contrast, bifidobacterial growth was not disturbed by 8hq. the results of this study showed the selective inhibitory effect of 8hq on clostridial and bifidobacterial growth dynamics, and  the potential of this compound for the development of selective agents to control cdis.

TI  == [outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
AB  == introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of  stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful  therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.

TI  == gut microbiota patterns associated with colonization of different clostridium difficile ribotypes.
AB  == c. difficile infection is associated with disturbed gut microbiota and changes in relative frequencies and abundance of individual bacterial taxons have been described. in this study we have analysed bacterial, fungal and archaeal microbiota by denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (dhplc) and with machine learning methods in 208 faecal samples from healthy volunteers and in routine samples with requested c. difficile testing. the latter were further divided according to stool consistency, c. difficile presence or absence and c. difficile ribotype (027 or non-027). lower microbiota diversity was a common trait of all routine samples and not necessarily connected only to c. difficile colonisation. differences between the healthy donors and c. difficile positive routine samples were detected in bacterial, fungal and archaeal components. bifidobacterium longum was the single most important species associated with c. difficile negative samples. however, by machine learning approaches we have identified patterns of microbiota composition predictive for c. difficile colonization. those patterns also differed between samples with c. difficile ribotype 027 and other c. difficile ribotypes. the results indicate that not only the presence of a single species/group is important but that certain combinations of gut microbes are associated with c. difficile carriage and that some ribotypes (027) might be associated with more disturbed microbiota than the others.

TI  == a probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  == objectives: evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics bifidobacterium longum bar33 and lactobacillus helveticus bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. design: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. participants: thirty-two elderly volunteers living in italy. the group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). intervention: subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. measurements: for each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform htf-microbi.array before and after intervention. results: our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. in particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens clostridium cluster xi, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecium  and the enteropathogenic genus campylobacter. conclusion: the present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides preference of probiotic bifidobacteria  and antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve 46, bifidobacterium lactis 8:8 and bifidobacterium longum 6:18 and three reference strains b. breve ccug 24611, b. lactis jcm 10602, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 were examined for acid and bile tolerance, prebiotic utilization and antimicrobial activity against four clostridium difficile (cd) strains including the hypervirulent strain, pcr ribotype nap1/027. b. lactis 8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 exhibited a high tolerance in mrsc broth with ph 2.5 for 30 min. b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 remained 100% viable in mrsc broth with 5% porcine bile after 4 h. all six strains showed a high prebiotic degrading ability (prebiotic score) with galactooligosaccharides (gos), isomaltooligosaccharides (imos) and lactulose as carbon sources and moderate degradation of fructooligosaccharides (fos). xylooligosaccharides (xos) was metabolized to a greater extent by b. lactis 8:8,  b. lactis jcm 10602, b. pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 and b. longum 6:18 (prebiotic  score >50%). all strains exhibited extracellular antimicrobial activity (ama) against four cd strains including the cd nap1/027. ama of b. breve 46, b. lactis  8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 strains was mainly ascribed to a combined action of organic acids and heat stable, protease sensitive antimicrobial peptides when cells were grown in mrsc broth with glucose and by acids when grown with five different prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides (ndos). none of c. difficile  strains degraded five prebiotic-ndos. whole cells of b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 and their supernatants inhibited the growth and toxin production of the cd nap1/027 strain.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == clostridium difficile colonization in early infancy is accompanied by changes in  intestinal microbiota composition.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major enteric pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. host susceptibility to c. difficile infections results partly from inability of the intestinal microbiota to resist c. difficile colonization. during early infancy, asymptomatic colonization by c. difficile is  common and the intestinal microbiota shows low complexity. thus, we investigated  the potential relationship between the microbiota composition and the implantation of c. difficile in infant gut. fecal samples from 53 infants, ages 0 to 13 months, 27 negative and 26 positive for c. difficile, were studied. dominant microbiota profiles were assessed by pcr-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). bacterial signatures of the intestinal microbiota associated with colonization by c. difficile were deciphered using principal component analysis (pca). resulting bands of interest in ttge profiles were excised, sequenced, and analyzed by nucleotide blast (ncbi). while global biodiversity was not affected, interclass pca on instrumental variables highlighted significant differences in dominant bacterial species between c. difficile-colonized and noncolonized infants (p = 0.017). four bands were specifically associated with the presence or absence of c. difficile: 16s rrna gene sequences related to ruminococcus gnavus and klebsiella pneumoniae for colonized infants and to bifidobacterium longum for noncolonized infants. we demonstrated that the presence of c. difficile in the intestinal microbiota of infants was associated with changes in this ecosystem's composition. these results suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota might be crucial in the colonization process, although the chronology of events remains to be determined.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis of the gut bacterium bifidobacterium longum reveals  loci susceptible to deletion during pure culture growth.
AB  == background: bifidobacteria are frequently proposed to be associated with good intestinal health primarily because of their overriding dominance in the feces of breast fed infants. however, clinical feeding studies with exogenous bifidobacteria show they don't remain in the intestine, suggesting they may lose  competitive fitness when grown outside the gut. results: to further the understanding of genetic attenuation that may be occurring in bifidobacteria cultures, we obtained the complete genome sequence of an intestinal isolate, bifidobacterium longum djo10a that was minimally cultured in the laboratory, and  compared it to that of a culture collection strain, b. longum ncc2705. this comparison revealed colinear genomes that exhibited high sequence identity, except for the presence of 17 unique dna regions in strain djo10a and six in strain ncc2705. while the majority of these unique regions encoded proteins of diverse function, eight from the djo10a genome and one from ncc2705, encoded gene clusters predicted to be involved in diverse traits pertinent to the human intestinal environment, specifically oligosaccharide and polyol utilization, arsenic resistance and lantibiotic production. seven of these unique regions were suggested by a base deviation index analysis to have been precisely deleted from  strain ncc2705 and this is substantiated by a dna remnant from within one of the  regions still remaining in the genome of ncc2705 at the same locus. this targeted loss of genomic regions was experimentally validated when growth of the intestinal b. longum in the laboratory for 1,000 generations resulted in two large deletions, one in a lantibiotic encoding region, analogous to a predicted deletion event for ncc2705. a simulated fecal growth study showed a significant reduced competitive ability of this deletion strain against clostridium difficile and e. coli. the deleted region was between two is30 elements which were experimentally demonstrated to be hyperactive within the genome. the other deleted region bordered a novel class of mobile elements, termed mobile integrase cassettes (mic) substantiating the likely role of these elements in genome deletion events. conclusion: deletion of genomic regions, often facilitated by mobile elements, allows bifidobacteria to adapt to fermentation environments in a very rapid manner (2 genome deletions per 1,000 generations) and the concomitant  loss of possible competitive abilities in the gut.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == adhesion properties and competitive pathogen exclusion ability of bifidobacteria  with acquired acid resistance.
AB  == the adhesion properties of bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum strains with an acquired resistance to acid and their ability to competitively exclude salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, enterobacter sakazakii, and clostridium difficile from adhering to human intestinal mucus were evaluated and compared with the results when the same experiments were run with the original acid-sensitive strains. in half of the four studied cases, the acid-resistant derivative showed a greater ability to adhere to human intestinal mucus than the original strain. the ability of bifidobacteria to inhibit pathogen adhesion to mucus was not generally improved by the acquisition of acid resistance. in contrast, three of the four acid-resistant strains showed a greater ability to displace preadhered pathogens  than the original strains, especially preadhered salmonella typhimurium and c. difficile. overall, the induction of acid resistance in bifidobacteria could be a strategy when selecting strains with enhanced stability and improved surface properties that favor their potential functionality as probiotics against specific pathogens.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

TI  == effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
AB  == thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. those in group  a also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of b. longum bb 536 and l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group b received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group c received placebo, for 21  days. in all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms,  involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of escherichia coli (p: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (p: < 0.05). the number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (p: < 0.05) in groups a and b over the same period. there was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly  caused by loss of bifidobacteria (p: < 0.05) in all groups. the number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group a than in group c at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group a, but six persons each in groups b and c. of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group a, one was  similar to the strain of b. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of b. longum during the investigation period. the administered strain of l. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group a.

TI  == clostridial pathogenicity in experimental necrotising enterocolitis in gnotobiotic quails and protective role of bifidobacteria.
AB  == the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (nec) remains unclear. gnotobiotic quails fed a lactose diet have been used to investigate the role of clostridial strains originating from faecal specimens of neonates through the intestinal lesions, the changes in microflora balance and the production of bacterial metabolites, i.e., short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen. bifidobacteria are thought to exert various beneficial effects on host health, including interaction with the colonic microflora. therefore, it was hypothesised that a protective role could be exercised through bifidobacterial colonisation. a clostridium butyricum strain (cb 155-3) and a whole faecal flora including three  clostridial species (c. butyricum, c. perfringens, c. difficile), each from premature infants suffering from nec, caused caecal lesions in quails similar to  those observed in man, i.e., thickening of the caecal wall with gas cysts, haemorrhagic ulceration and necrotic areas. conversely, a whole faecal flora including bifidobacteria (identified as bifidobacterium pseudo-catenulatum) and no clostridia, isolated from a healthy premature infant, was unable to produce nec-like lesions. when the two clostridial groups were associated with a bifidobacterium strain (b. infantis-longum, cuetm 89-215, isolated from a healthy infant), bifidobacterial colonisation suppressed all pathological lesions. this study is the first demonstration of a protective role for bifidobacteria against  nec via the inhibition of growth of c. butyricum or the disappearance of c. perfringens. c. difficile was not found to be responsible for the aetiology of the caecal lesions in quails. the main effect of bifidobacteria on lactose fermentation was either a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of butyric acid. the protective role was not associated with changes in h2 production. therefore,  a new step between colonic colonisation and its relevance to nec is thought to involve the fermentation of unabsorbed lactose into butyric acid at the onset of  the disease.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.
