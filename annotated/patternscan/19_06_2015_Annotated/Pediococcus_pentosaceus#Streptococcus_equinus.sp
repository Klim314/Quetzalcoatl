TI  == detection and characterization of pediocin pa-1/ach like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from seven different sources. eight isolates were found to produce pediocin pa-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedb gene pcr and dot-blot hybridization. the culture  filtrate (cf) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and lab. the identification and genetic diversity among the selected lab was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like rflp, rapd, and 16s rdna gene sequencing. the isolates were identified as, 1 each of pediococcus acidilactici cb1, lactobacillus plantarum acr2, and streptococcus equinus ac1, 2 were of p. pentosaceus cb4 and r38, and other 3 were enterococcus faecium acr4, bl1, v3. partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline ph, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kda and shared the properties of class iia pediocin-family. the bacteriocin production at different temperatures, ph, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of thailand.
AB  == plaa-som is a thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. a total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on caco(3)-mrs agar plates. they were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal dna sequencing as lactococcus garvieae,  streptococcus bovis, weissella cibaria, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus fermentum. freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of lab (less than 10 cfu/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)cfu/g. early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of lc. garvieae, s. bovis, and w. cibaria. at 48 h into fermentation, w. cibaria, p. pentosaceus, and lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. a mixture of these lab species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.
