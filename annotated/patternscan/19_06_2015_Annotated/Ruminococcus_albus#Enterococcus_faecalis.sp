TI  == screening currency notes for microbial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes  using a shotgun metagenomic approach.
AB  == fomites are a well-known source of microbial infections and previous studies have provided insights into the sojourning microbiome of fomites from various sources. paper currency notes are one of the most commonly exchanged objects and its potential to transmit pathogenic organisms has been well recognized. approaches to identify the microbiome associated with paper currency notes have been largely limited to culture dependent approaches. subsequent studies portrayed the use of  16s ribosomal rna based approaches which provided insights into the taxonomical distribution of the microbiome. however, recent techniques including shotgun sequencing provides resolution at gene level and enable estimation of their copy  numbers in the metagenome. we investigated the microbiome of indian paper currency notes using a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. metagenomic dna isolated from samples of frequently circulated denominations of indian currency notes were sequenced using illumina hiseq sequencer. analysis of the data revealed presence of species belonging to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genera. the taxonomic distribution at kingdom level revealed contigs mapping to eukaryota (70%), bacteria (9%), viruses and archae (~1%). we identified 78 pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterococcus faecalis, and 75 cellulose degrading organisms including acidothermus cellulolyticus, cellulomonas flavigena and ruminococcus albus. additionally, 78 antibiotic resistance genes were identified and 18 of these were found in all the samples. furthermore, six out of 78 pathogens harbored at least one of the 18 common antibiotic resistance genes. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of shotgun metagenome sequence dataset of paper currency notes, which can be useful for future applications including as bio-surveillance of exchangeable fomites for infectious agents.

TI  == longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (uc). although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. the aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active uc over a period of 1 year. real-time pcr was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in uc patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the uc mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. high clinical activity indices (cai) and sigmoidoscopy scores (ss) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type e clostridium perfringens, and enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for clostridium butyricum, ruminococcus albus, and eubacterium rectale. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low cai. only e. rectale and clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. these findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in uc and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.
