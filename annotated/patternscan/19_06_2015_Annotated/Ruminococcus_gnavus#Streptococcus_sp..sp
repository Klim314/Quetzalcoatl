TI  == exercise induction of gut microbiota modifications in obese, non-obese and hypertensive rats.
AB  == background: obesity is a multifactor disease associated with cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension. recently, gut microbiota was linked to obesity pathogenesisand shown to influence the host metabolism. moreover, several factors such as host-genotype and life-style have been shown to modulate gut microbiota composition. exercise is a well-known agent used for the treatment of numerous pathologies, such as obesity and hypertension; it has recently been demonstrated  to shape gut microbiota consortia. since exercise-altered microbiota could possibly improve the treatment of diseases related to dysfunctional microbiota, this study aimed to examine the effect of controlled exercise training on gut microbial composition in obese rats (n = 3), non-obese wistar rats (n = 3) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 3). pyrosequencing of 16s rrna genes from fecal samples collected before and after exercise training was used for this purpose. results: exercise altered the composition and diversity of gut bacteria  at genus level in all rat lineages. allobaculum (hypertensive rats), pseudomonas  and lactobacillus (obese rats) were shown to be enriched after exercise, while streptococcus (wistar rats), aggregatibacter and sutturella (hypertensive rats) were more enhanced before exercise. a significant correlation was seen in the clostridiaceae and bacteroidaceae families and oscillospira and ruminococcus genera with blood lactate accumulation. moreover, wistar and hypertensive rats were shown to share a similar microbiota composition, as opposed to obese rats. finally, streptococcus alactolyticus, bifidobacterium animalis, ruminococcus gnavus, aggregatibacter pneumotropica and bifidobacterium pseudolongum were enriched in obese rats. conclusions: these data indicate that non-obese and hypertensive rats harbor a different gut microbiota from obese rats and that exercise training alters gut microbiota from an obese and hypertensive genotype background.

TI  == impact of the metabolic activity of streptococcus thermophilus on the colon epithelium of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is widely and traditionally used in the dairy industry. despite the vast level of consumption of s. thermophilus through yogurt or probiotic functional food, very few data are available about its physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (git). the objective of the present work was to explore both the metabolic activity and host response  of s. thermophilus in vivo. our study profiles the protein expression of s. thermophilus after its adaptation to the git of gnotobiotic rats and describes the impact of s. thermophilus colonization on the colonic epithelium. s. thermophilus colonized progressively the git of germ-free rats to reach a stable  population in 30 days (10(8) cfu/g of feces). this progressive colonization suggested that s. thermophilus undergoes an adaptation process within git. indeed, we showed that the main response of s. thermophilus in the rat's git was  the massive induction of the glycolysis pathway, leading to formation of lactate  in the cecum. at the level of the colonic epithelium, the abundance of monocarboxylic acid transporter mrnas (slc16a1 and slc5a8) and a protein involved in the cell cycle arrest (p27(kip1)) increased in the presence of s. thermophilus compared with germ-free rats. based on different mono-associated rats harboring two different strains of s. thermophilus (lmd-9 or lmg18311) or weak lactate-producing commensal bacteria (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and ruminococcus gnavus), we propose that lactate could be a signal produced by s. thermophilus and modulating the colon epithelium.

TI  == high temporal and inter-individual variation detected in the human ileal microbiota.
AB  == the diversity and temporal stability of the predominant bacteria in the human ileum was studied with the use of ileal effluent samples of seven individuals with brooke ileostomies. the total number of bacteria within the ileal effluent was in the range of 10(7) -10(8) bacteria per gram (wet weight). the diversity of the bacteria in the ileal effluent showed marked differences compared with that in faecal samples from age-matched healthy adults. the ileal effluent had a higher relative abundance of species within the orders lactobacillales and clostridiales, mainly streptococcus bovis-related species, and the veillonella group, and a lower proportion of species related to ruminococcus gnavus, r. obeum and bacteroides plebeius. in addition, inter-individual differences were found, indicative of a highly personal ileal microbiota profile. furthermore, temporal profiles showed large fluctuations per individual over a period of 9-28 days (average similarity over a period of 9 days was as low as 44%), and differences between morning and afternoon profiles were observed. parallel cloning and sequencing efforts revealed several phylotypes that were not identified in previous studies (12 out of 65 phylotypes showed less than 97% sequence similarity with previously reported sequences). achaea were found to be below detection limit by quantitative pcr. overall, the results indicate that the microbiota of the human ileum is relatively unstable, less complex and consisting of different dominating phylotypes when compared with the colonic microbiota.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus ruminococcus, does not support the reclassification of streptococcus hansenii and peptostreptococcus productus as ruminococci.
AB  == the 16s rrna gene sequence of the type strain of ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus ruminococcus, was determined by pcr direct sequencing.  a comparative sequence analysis showed that r. flavefaciens is phylogenetically related to a small cluster (cluster iv of collins et al. [m. d. collins, p. a. lawson, a. willems, j. j. cordoba, j. fernandez-garayzabal, p. garcia, j. cai, h. hippe, and j. a. e. farrow, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994]) of organisms which includes several clostridium and eubacterium species. r. flavefaciens was found to be phylogenetically only remotely related to ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques, peptostreptococcus productus, and streptococcus hansenii. these findings demonstrate that the genus ruminococcus is not a monophyletic group, and the proposed transfer of p. productus and s. hansenii to this genus (t. ezaki, n. li, y. hashimoto, h. miura, and h. yamamoto, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:130-136, 1994) is not supported.
