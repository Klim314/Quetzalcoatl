TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  == the antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.oh), superoxide anion radical (.o2(-)), methoxy radical (.ch2oh), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.co2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.no) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.dpph) radical. it reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising  activity against .co2(-), .ch2oh and .dpph radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .no, .o2(-) and .oh radicals (38%, 23% and 15%,  respectively). the antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. to varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (mic 0.003-0.038 mg/ml and mbc 0.013-0.052 mg/ml, mic 0.008-0.016 mg/ml and mfc 0.090-0.520 mg/ml, respectively). according to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.

TI  == insights into the cross-immunity mechanism within effector families of bacteria type vi secretion system from the structure of sttae4-ectai4 complex.
AB  == the gram-negative bacteria type vi secretion system (t6ss) has been found to play an important role in interbacterial competition, biofilm formation and many other virulence-related processes. the bacteria harboring t6ss inject the effectors into their recipient's cytoplasm or periplasm to kill them and meanwhile, to avoid inhibiting itself, the cognate immunity proteins were produced to acts as the effector inhibitor. tae4 (type vi amidase effector 4) and tai4 (type vi amidase immunity 4) are newly identified t6ss effector-immunity (ei) pairs. we have recently solved the structures of sttae4-tai4 and ectae4-tai4 complexes from the human pathogens salmonella typhimurium and enterobacter cloacae, respectively. it is very interesting and important to discover whether there is cross-neutralization between st- and ectai4 and whether their effector inhibition mechanism is conserved. here, we determined the crystal structure of sttae4 in complex with ectai4. the solution conformation study revealed it is a compact heterotetramer that consists of an ectai4 homodimer binding two sttae4 molecules  in solution, different from that in crystal. a remarkable shift can be observed in both the flexible winding loop of sttae4 and protruding loop of ectai4 and disulfide bonds are formed to stabilize their overall conformations. the in vitro and in vivo interactions studies showed ectai4 can efficiently rescue the cells from the toxicity of its cognate effectors sttae4, but can not neutralize the toxic activities of the effectors from other families. these findings provide clear structural evidence to support the previous observation of cross-immunity within t6ss families and provide a basis for understanding their important roles  in polymicrobial environments.

TI  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, united states.
AB  == we characterized 9 new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae  (5 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 salmonella enterica serovar senftenberg) isolates identified in the united states and cultured from 8 patients in 5 states during april 2009-march 2011. isolates were resistant to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, demonstrated mics </=1 microg/ml of colistin and polymyxin, and yielded positive  metallo-beta-lactamase screening results. eight isolates had blandm-1, and 1 isolate had a novel allele (blandm-6). all 8 patients had recently been in india  or pakistan, where 6 received inpatient health care. plasmids carrying blandm frequently carried ampc or extended spectrum beta-lactamase genes. two k. pneumoniae isolates and a k. pneumoniae isolate from sweden shared incompatibility group a/c plasmids with indistinguishable restriction patterns and a common blandm fragment; all 3 were multilocus sequence type 14. restriction profiles of the remaining new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase plasmids, including 2  from the same patient, were diverse.

TI  == internalisation potential of escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  == the internalisation potential of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) cfu/ml) and used to irrigate the plants. the potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. internalisation of each of the  human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. to our knowledge, this is the first report of s. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. in addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (maldi-tof). background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four  pathogens evaluated in this study. a low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, lysinibacillus fusiformis, rhodococcus rhodochrous, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis were identified.

TI  == structure of the type vi effector-immunity complex (tae4-tai4) provides novel insights into the inhibition mechanism of the effector by its immunity protein.
AB  == the type vi secretion system (t6ss), a multisubunit needle-like apparatus, has recently been found to play a role in interspecies interactions. the gram-negative bacteria harboring t6ss (donor) deliver the effectors into their neighboring cells (recipient) to kill them. meanwhile, the cognate immunity proteins were employed to protect the donor cells against the toxic effectors. tae4 (type vi amidase effector 4) and tai4 (type vi amidase immunity 4) are newly identified t6ss effector-immunity pairs. here, we report the crystal structures of tae4 from enterobacter cloacae and tae4-tai4 complexes from both e. cloacae and salmonella typhimurium. tae4 acts as a dl-endopeptidase and displays a typical n1pc/p60 domain. unlike tsi1 (type vi secretion immunity 1), tai4 is an all-helical protein and forms a dimer in solution. the small angle x-ray scattering study combined with the analytical ultracentrifugation reveal that the tae4-tai4 complex is a compact heterotetramer that consists of a tai4 dimer and two tae4 molecules in solution. structure-based mutational analysis of the tae4-tai4 interface shows that a helix (alpha3) of one subunit in dimeric tai4 plays a major role in binding of tae4, whereas a protruding loop (l4) in the other subunit is mainly responsible for inhibiting tae4 activity. the inhibition  process requires collaboration between the tai4 dimer. these results reveal a novel and unique inhibition mechanism in effector-immunity pairs and suggest a new strategy to develop antipathogen drugs.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == analysis of bacterial diversity during the fermentation of inyu, a high-temperature fermented soy sauce, using nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the plate count method.
AB  == the diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. the dgge profiles targeted the bacterial 16s rdna and revealed the presence of citrobacter farmeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pantoea agglomerans, salmonella enterica, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus sciuri and weissella confusa. the bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. the bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; brachybacterium rhamnosum, e.  hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, kurthia gibsonii, pantoea dispersa, staphylococcus gallinarum, staphylococcus kloosii and s. sciuri were identified. koji collected  during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and e. hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and enterobacter pulveris were identified.  in brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 bacillus species, but 4 staphylococcus species and delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. this study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and  provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.

TI  == the target of daptomycin is absent from escherichia coli and other gram-negative  pathogens.
AB  == antistaphylococcal agents commonly lack activity against gram-negative bacteria like escherichia coli owing to the permeability barrier presented by the outer membrane and/or the action of efflux transporters. when these intrinsic resistance mechanisms are artificially compromised, such agents almost invariably demonstrate antibacterial activity against gram negatives. here we show that this is not the case for the antibiotic daptomycin, whose target appears to be absent  from e. coli and other gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == outbreak of a novel enterobacter sp. carrying blactx-m-15 in a neonatal unit of a tertiary care hospital in tanzania.
AB  == enterobacter hormaechei and cronobacter sakazakii are amongst the most important  causes of outbreaks of neonatal sepsis associated with powdered milk. in this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel enterobacter sp. harbouring bla(ctx-m-15) in a neonatal unit in tanzania. seventeen gram-negative  enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the bla(ctx-m-15) gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing. isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of  16s ribosomal dna (rdna), rpob and hsp60 alleles. environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as salmonella enterica serotype paratyphi. all isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour bla(ctx-m-15) on a 291-kb narrow-range plasmid. pfge analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of  a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35%. the same strain was isolated from a milk bucket. phylogenetic analysis using 16s rdna, rpob and hsp60 sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the enterobacter cloacae complex with similarities of 92-98.8%. the data describe an outbreak of a novel bla(ctx-m-15)-positive, multiresistant enterobacter strain in an african neonatal unit that can easily be misidentified  taxonomically. these data highlight the need for constant surveillance of bacteria harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases as well as improvements in  hygiene measures in developing countries.

TI  == comparative analysis of the bacterial flora of vegetables collected directly from farms and from supermarkets in germany.
AB  == a total of 1,001 vegetables were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in bavaria, germany; 722 samples were positive for coliforms (mostly enterobacter cloacae; n = 176). escherichia coli were detected in 34, pseudomonas spp. in 439, salmonella spp. in 1, enterococcus spp. in 682, and listeria spp. in 11 samples.  prevalence of all investigated genera tended to be lower in samples collected at  the supermarket. however, prevalence of pseudomonas fluorescens was higher in supermarket samples. cereals/bulbous vegetables were less contaminated than root  vegetables/salads. fruit vegetables seem to be often subsequently contaminated in the retail market. compared to foods of animal origin, prevalence of pathogenic bacteria is low. particularly, in 1,001 investigated vegetables, only four l. monocytogenes and one salmonella enterica have been found. almost all of the detected microorganisms are reported to be opportunistic pathogens, if only in rare cases. therefore, fresh produce should be washed or peeled before it is eaten raw.

TI  == sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == resistance development profiling of piperacillin in combination with the novel {beta}-lactamase inhibitor bli-489.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate development of resistance to the piperacillin/bli-489 combination. methods: bli-489 was used at a constant concentration of 4 mg/l. spontaneous mutation frequency was measured on piperacillin/bli-489-containing agar plates. five beta-lactamase-producing strains were exposed to a serial dilution of piperacillin/bli-489, and the highest concentration allowing growth was used to inoculate subsequent serial passage for 10 days. mutation stability was monitored in drug-free medium for 10 days. results: escherichia coli (oxa-3,  oxa-7, act-1, shv-1 or none), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (ctx-m-5),  klebsiella pneumoniae (shv-1 and shv-5) and enterobacter cloacae (ampc) had a spontaneous mutation frequency of < or =1.0 x 10(-9). two ampc-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains had a mutation frequency of 6.52 x 10(-6) and 1.0  x 10(-7); a beta-lactamase-negative p. aeruginosa strain had a mutation frequency of 2.68 x 10(-8). the mutant prevention concentration (mpc) was < or =32 mg/l. during serial passages, the mic increased 64- and 128-fold for s. enterica serovar typhimurium (ctx-m-5) and e. cloacae (ampc), respectively, to > or =512 mg/l. the mic reverted to < or =64 mg/l after serial passages in drug-free medium. the mics increased only 4-fold for k. pneumoniae (shv-1 and shv-5), e. coli (oxa-3) and e. coli (shv-1). conclusions: piperacillin/bli-489 demonstrated  a low probability of spontaneous resistance development in vitro for all of the strains tested with the exception of p. aeruginosa. the mpc value for all strains was < or =32 mg/l. resistance developed during serial passage for two of the five strains tested; however, this resistance phenotype was unstable as mic values reverted to < or =64 mg/l after propagation in drug-free medium.

TI  == identification of resistance and virulence factors in an epidemic enterobacter hormaechei outbreak strain.
AB  == bacterial strains differ in their ability to cause hospital outbreaks. using comparative genomic hybridization, enterobacter cloacae complex isolates were studied to identify genetic markers specific for enterobacter cloacae complex outbreak strains. no outbreak-specific genes were found that were common in all investigated outbreak strains. therefore, the aim of our study was to identify specific genetic markers for an enterobacter hormaechei outbreak strain (ehos) that caused a nationwide outbreak in the netherlands. most ehos isolates carried  a large conjugative plasmid (pqc) containing genes encoding heavy-metal resistance, mobile elements, pili-associated proteins and exported proteins as well as multiple-resistance genes. furthermore, the chromosomally encoded high-pathogenicity island (hpi) was highly associated with the ehos strain. in addition, other dna fragments were identified that were associated with virulence: three dna fragments known to be located on a virulence plasmid (plvpk), as well as phage- and plasmid-related sequences. also, four dna fragments encoding putative pili with the most homology to pili of salmonella enterica were associated with the ehos. finally, four dna fragments encoding putative outer-membrane proteins were negatively associated with the ehos. in conclusion, resistance and putative virulence genes were identified in the ehos that may have contributed to increased epidemicity. the high number of genes detected in the ehos that were related to transferable elements reflects the genomic plasticity of the e. cloacae complex and may explain the emergence of the ehos in the hospital environment.

TI  == nitrous oxide emission and microbial community in the rhizosphere of nodulated soybeans during the late growth period.
AB  == we examined n(2)o emissions from the rhizosphere of field-grown soybeans during the late growth stage (99-117 days after sowing). marked emissions were detected  from the nodulated root systems of field-grown soybeans, whereas a non-nodulating soybean mutant showed no emission. degraded nodules exclusively generated the n(2)o. a culture-independent analysis of microbial communities showed bradyrhizobium sp., acidvorax facilis, salmonella enterica, xanthomonas sp., enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, fusarium sp., nematodes, and other protozoans to be more abundant in the degraded nodules, suggesting that some of these organisms participate in the n(2)o emission process in the soybean rhizosphere.

AB  == studies were conducted to isolate bacteria inhibitory to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium definitive type (dt) 104 in vitro from cattle not carrying salmonella and to determine the inhibitory activity of the isolated bacteria through competitive growth in cattle feces artificially contaminated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 and s. enterica serovar newport. fecal samples (108) were obtained from dairy and beef cows. s. enterica serovars were isolated from 9.25% of the samples and included salmonella newport (4), salmonella bareilly (1), salmonella mbandaka (1), salmonella montevideo (1), salmonella meleagridis (1), and monophasic salmonella (2). all four salmonella newport isolates were resistant to at least nine antibiotics. of 1,097 bacterial isolates from cattle feces screened, 30 were inhibitory to salmonella typhimurium dt104 in vitro. the  inhibitory isolates included 22 escherichia coli, 6 bacillus circulans, 1 serratia fonticola, and 1 enterobacter cloacae. typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed 17 distinguishable profiles among the 22 e. coli. competitive inhibition isolates did not significantly reduce salmonella typhimurium dt104 during 21 days of storage at 37 degrees c in cattle feces. b. circulans (10(5) cfu/g of inoculum) significantly reduced salmonella newport on days 3 and 5 and on day 21 with 10(8) cfu/g of inoculum at 37 degrees c. at 21degrees c, significant reductions of salmonella typhimurium dt104 occurred with 10(8) cfu of gram-negative competitive inhibition bacteria per g and 10(5) cfu of b. circulans per g on day 5 only. no significant reductions were observed with salmonella newport at 21 degrees c. the 25 competitive inhibition bacteria identified in this study offer a first step in identifying competitive inhibition bacteria that may reduce the level of intestinal carriage and fecal shedding of salmonella typhimurium dt104 and salmonella newport in cattle.

TI  == cloning, nucleotide sequencing, and analysis of the acrab-tolc efflux pump of enterobacter cloacae and determination of its involvement in antibiotic resistance in a clinical isolate.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae is an emerging clinical pathogen that may be responsible for nosocomial infections. management of these infections is often difficult, owing to the high frequency of strains that are resistant to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents in the clinical setting. multidrug efflux pumps, especially  those belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division family, play a major role as a mechanism of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative pathogens. in the present study, we cloned and sequenced the genes encoding an acracb-tolc-like efflux pump from an e. cloacae clinical isolate (isolate ecdc64) showing a broad  antibiotic resistance profile. sequence analysis showed that the acrr, acra, acrb, and tolc genes encode proteins that display 79.8%, 84%, 88%, and 82% amino  acid identities with the respective homologues of enterobacter aerogenes and are  arranged in a similar pattern. deletion of the acra gene to yield an acra-deficient ecdc64 mutant (ecdeltaacra) showed the involvement of acrab-tolc in multidrug resistance in e. cloacae. however, experiments with an efflux pump inhibitor suggested that additional efflux systems also play a role in antibiotic resistance. investigation of several unrelated isolates of e. cloacae by pcr analysis revealed that the acrab system is apparently ubiquitous in this species.

TI  == antibacterial activity of coffee extracts and selected coffee chemical compounds  against enterobacteria.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of commercial coffee extracts and chemical compounds was investigated on nine strains of enterobacteria. the antimicrobial activity investigated by the disc diffusion method was observed in both the extracts and tested chemical compounds. even though ph, color, and the contents of trigonelline, caffeine, and chlorogenic acids differed significantly among the coffee extracts, no significant differences were observed in their antimicrobial  activity. caffeic acid and trigonelline showed similar inhibitory effect against  the growth of the microorganisms. caffeine, chlorogenic acid, and protocatechuic  acid showed particularly strong effect against serratia marcescens and enterobacter cloacae. the ic(50) and ic(90) for the compounds determined by the microtiter plate method indicated that trigonelline, caffeine, and protocatechuic acids are potential natural antimicrobial agents against salmonella enterica. the concentrations of caffeine found in coffee extracts are enough to warrant 50% of  the antimicrobial effect against s. enterica, which is relevant to human safety.

TI  == dissemination and persistence of blactx-m-9 are linked to class 1 integrons containing cr1 associated with defective transposon derivatives from tn402 located in early antibiotic resistance plasmids of inchi2, incp1-alpha, and incfi groups.
AB  == this study analyzes the diversity of in60, a class 1 integron bearing cr1 and containing bla(ctx-m-9), and its association with tn402, tn21, and classical conjugative plasmids among 45 ctx-m-9-producing clinical strains (41 escherichia  coli strains, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 1 salmonella enterica strain, and  1 enterobacter cloacae strain). forty-five patients in a spanish tertiary care hospital were studied (1996 to 2003). the diversity of in60 and association of in60 with tn402 or mercury resistance transposons were investigated by overlapping pcr assays and/or hybridization. plasmid characterization included comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and determination of incompatibility group by pcr-based replicon typing, sequencing, and hybridization. ctx-m-9 plasmids belonged to inchi2 (n = 26), incp-1alpha (n = 10), incfi (n = 4), and inci (n = 1) groups. genetic platforms containing bla(ctx-m-9) were classified in six types in relation to the in60 backbone and in eight subtypes in relation to tn402 derivatives. they were associated with tn21 sequences when located in incp-1alpha or inchi2 plasmids. our study identified bla(ctx-m-9) in a high diversity of cr1-bearing class 1 integrons linked to different tn402 derivatives, often to tn21, highlighting the role of recombination events in the evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids. the presence of bla(ctx-m-9) on broad-host-range incp-1alpha plasmids might contribute to its dissemination to hosts that were not members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == plasmid-mediated high-level gentamicin resistance among enteric bacteria isolated from pet turtles in louisiana.
AB  == the sale of small turtles is banned by the food and drug administration from the  u.s. market due to concerns about their excretion of salmonella spp. to produce a safe pet for the export market, the louisiana pet turtle industry uses gentamicin sulfate baths (1,000 microg/ml) to eradicate salmonella spp. from turtle eggs. in 1999, we analyzed bacterial samples recovered from turtle farms and found that strains of salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae and other bacteria, such as enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were resistant to high concentrations of gentamicin (>2,000 microg/ml) and to other aminoglycosides. the goal of this study was to identify the gene(s) which contributes to the high-level gentamicin resistance phenotype observed in bacteria from environmental samples with turtle farming activity, particularly the salmonellae, and to estimate the incidence of such genes in these bacteria. r plasmids from gentamicin-resistant strains were transferred by conjugation and transformation to naive escherichia coli cells. cloning and sequencing of the gentamicin resistance determinants on these plasmids revealed the presence of the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase genes aac(3)-iia and aac(3)-via; the latter was present as a gene cassette of a class 1 integron. multiplex pcr assays showed that every gentamicin-resistant isolate carried one of these acetyltransferase genes. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of r plasmids carrying these genes revealed different restriction profiles and sizes, indicating a dissemination of  the gentamicin resistance genes through mobile molecular elements. the data presented highlight the need to develop an alternate method for the eradication of salmonella spp. from turtle eggs.

TI  == worldwide disseminated arma aminoglycoside resistance methylase gene is borne by  composite transposon tn1548.
AB  == the arma (aminoglycoside resistance methylase) gene, which confers resistance to  4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamines and fortimicin, was initially found in klebsiella pneumoniae bm4536 on incl/m plasmid pip1204 of ca. 90 kb which also encodes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ctx-m-3. thirty-four enterobacteria  from various countries that were likely to produce a ctx-m enzyme since they were more resistant to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime were studied. the arma gene was  detected in 12 clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and shigella flexneri, in which it was always associated with bla(ctx-m-3) on an incl/m plasmid. conjugation, analysis of dna sequences, pcr mapping, and plasmid conduction experiments indicated that the arma gene was part of composite transposon tn1548  together with genes ant3"9, sul1, and dfrxii, which are responsible for resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, respectively. the 16.6-kb genetic element was flanked by two copies of is6 and migrated by replicative transposition. this observation accounts for the presence of arma on self-transferable plasmids of various incompatibility groups and its worldwide dissemination. it thus appears that posttranscriptional modification of 16s rrna confers high-level resistance to all the clinically available aminoglycosides except streptomycin in gram-negative human and animal pathogens.

AB  == bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, b, c, and d, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. there are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene b (homology to ubix) and c (ubid) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene d, are not numerous ( approximately 15). the occurrence of the entire bcd gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement cdb), streptomyces sp. d7, bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella enterica, s. paratyphi, s. typhimurium, s. bongori, and s. diarizonae. the corresponding genes from s. hydroxybenzoicus, b. subtilis, streptomyces sp. d7, e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, and s. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in e. coli dh5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.

AB  == the effect of high-energy electron beam irradiation on the survival of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and psychrotrophic bacteria on commercial chicken breast meat was evaluated. fresh chicken breast meat was purchased from a local poultry processor, inoculated with 8 log10 cfu/ml salmonella, packaged in styrofoam trays and over wrapped with a polyvinyl chloride film, and subjected to 0, 1, 2, or 3 kgy of irradiation. the packaged samples were stored at 4 degrees c and analyzed for salmonella typhimurium and psychrotrophic organisms at 0, 2, 4,  6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 d of storage. direct plating and enrichment methods were used for s. typhimurium analyses. the direct plating method revealed a 4 log reduction in salmonella for chicken breasts inoculated and treated with 1, 2, or  3 kgy of irradiation. psychrotrophic counts were conducted at 7 degrees c for 10  d and 25 degrees c for 5 d to determine the effect of incubation methods on the recovery of psychrotrophic organisms. the enrichment method resulted in the repair of injured salmonella cells and an elevated salmonella typhimurium count for all irradiation dosages when compared with data reported for the direct plating method. in general, psychrotrophic counts increased as storage time increased. however, psychrotrophic counts decreased (p < 0.05) as the irradiation dosage increased.

TI  == interactions of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes plants cultivated in a gnotobiotic system.
AB  == the growth and persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes on a diverse range of plant types over extended cultivation periods was studied. when introduced on the seed of carrot, cress, lettuce, radish, spinach and tomato all the pathogens became rapidly established  shortly after germination, attaining cell densities of the order of 5.5-6.5 log cfu/g. in general, es. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes became established and persisted at significantly higher levels on seedlings (9 days post-germination) than salmonella. es. coli o157:h7 became internalized in cress, lettuce, radish and spinach seedlings but was not recovered within the tissues of mature plants.  internalization of salmonella was also observed in lettuce and radish but not cress or spinach seedlings. in contrast, l. monocytogenes did not internalize within seedlings but did persist on the surface of plants throughout the cultivation period. co-inoculation of isolates recovered from the rhizosphere of  plants did not significantly affect the numbers or persistence of human pathogens. the only exception was with enterobacter cloacae, which reduced es. coli o157:h7 ph1 and l. monocytogenes levels by ca. 1 log cfu/g on lettuce. with  the bioluminescent phenotype of es. coli o157:h7 ph1, it was demonstrated that the human pathogen became established on the roots of growing plants. scanning electron micrographs of root seedlings suggested that es. coli o157:h7 ph1 preferentially colonized the root junctions of seedlings. it is proposed that such colonization sites enhanced the persistence of es. coli o157:h7 on plants and facilitated internalization within developing seedlings. the results suggest  that the risk associated with internalized human pathogens in salad vegetables at harvest is low. nevertheless, the introduction of human pathogens at an early stage of plant development could enhance their persistence in the rhizosphere. the implications of the study with regards to on-farm food safety initiatives are discussed.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the acid-inducible asr gene in enterobacteria.
AB  == we show here that transcription of the asr gene in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae is strongly dependent on the acidification level of the growth medium, with maximal  induction at ph 4.0-4.5 as determined by northern hybridization analysis. previous gene array analyses have also shown that asr is the most acid-induced gene in the e. coli genome. sequence alignment of the asr promoters from different enterobacterial species identified a highly conserved region located at position -70 to -30 relative to the asr transcriptional start site. by deletion of various segments of this region in the e. coli asr promoter it was shown that  sequences upstream from the -40 position were important for induction. transcription from the e. coli asr promoter was demonstrated to be growth-phase-dependent and to require the alternative sigma factor rpos (sigma(s)) in stationary phase. transcription of the asr gene was also found to be subject to negative control by the nucleoid protein h-ns.

TI  == plasmid-encoded functions compensate for the biological cost of ampc overexpression in a clinical isolate of salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == objectives: in a previous study with a salmonella typhimurium strain containing cloned ampc-ampr from enterobacter cloacae, it was suggested that ampc expression must be kept at low levels by ampr to maintain normal growth and virulent phenotype. the purpose of this study was to determine whether findings obtained with a laboratory model can be extended to a virulent clinical isolate of s. typhimurium expressing the plasmid-encoded bla(cmy-7). methods: disc induction assays were carried out to investigate inducibility of bla(cmy-7). primer extension and sequence analyses were carried out to map the transcriptional start site of bla(cmy-7) and determine the relative expression. growth and invasion potential of salmonella strains were monitored by optical density, viable counts  and cell invasion assays. results: sequence analysis confirmed the absence of ampr upstream of bla(cmy-7) therefore confirming the negative results observed using the disc induction assay. primer extension analysis mapped the start site of bla(cmy-7) transcription within an isecp1-like element. the relative expression of bla(cmy-7) was approximately 965-fold higher than the expression of a wild-type citrobacter freundii chromosomal ampc and approximately 4.1-fold higher than ampc expression from a derepressed mutant of c. freundii. growth and  the capacity to invade mammalian cells were not compromised for either the clinical isolate or the s. typhimurium transconjugant containing bla(cmy-7). however, a salmonella transformant containing bla(cmy-7) exhibited a compromised  phenotype with respect to growth and invasion of mammalian cells. conclusion: these findings indicate that the biological cost of high-level ampc production can be compensated by plasmid-encoded factors and not by regulating ampc expression.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == an improved 16s rrna based pcr method for the specific detection of salmonella enterica.
AB  == a molecular method for the detection of salmonella enterica strains based on 16s  rrna sequence analysis was developed by a modification of the previously described pcr primer 16sfi [j. appl. bacteriol. 80 (1996) 659], which was combined with a newly developed primer annealing at the position 66-82. only approximately two thirds of now determined salmonella 16s rrna sequences contained a region identical to the 16sfi primer sequence and the reverse primer  16siii was also not specific. combined, these two primers have been claimed to allow the specific detection of all salmonella; however, in this study, they did  not recognize s. bongori and 3 out of 78 tested s. enterica strains. they also identified some of the tested enterobacter cloacae strains as salmonella. on the  contrary, the new primer pair, minf and minr, made it possible to recognize correctly all of the 78 tested s. enterica strains, representing 31 different salmonella serovars. none of the 23 non-salmonella strains from the related gamma-proteobacterial genera was incorrectly recognized as belonging to s. enterica.

TI  == structural requirements of the mrna for intracistronic translation initiation of  the enterobacterial infb gene.
AB  == background: the gene infb encodes the prokaryotic translation initiation factor if2, a central macromolecular component in the formation of the ribosomal 70s initiation complex. in escherichia coli, infb encodes three forms of if2: if2alpha, if2beta and if2gamma. the expression of if2beta and if2gamma is a tandem translation from intact infb mrna and not merely a translation of post-transcriptionally truncated mrna. the molecular mechanism responsible for the ribosomal recognition of the two intracistronic translation initiation sites  in e. coli infb is not well characterized. results: we found three different forms of if2 in enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella enterica, salmonella typhimurium, and two different forms in proteus vulgaris. we identified the intracistronic translation initiation sites of the mrna by isolation and n-terminal sequencing of the shorter isoforms of if2 in s. enterica and s. typhimurium. a further search in the readily available public sequence databases revealed that infb from yersinia pestis also contains an intracistronic in-frame initiation site used for the translation of if2beta. the base composition in a part of the 5' end of the dna coding strand of the enterobacterial infb gene shows a strong preference for adenine (a) over thymine  (t) with a maximum ratio of a-to-t around the intracistronic initiation sites. we demonstrate that the mrna has an open structure around the ribosomal binding region. conclusion: efficient intracistronic translation initiation of the infb gene is suggested to require an mrna with this special base composition that results in an open, single-stranded structure at the ribosomal binding region.

AB  == background: in the past decade, flow cytometry has become a useful and precise alternative to microscopic bacterial cell counts in aquatic samples. however, little evidence of its usefulness for the evaluation of bacterial biovolumes has  emerged in from the literature. methods: the light scattering and cell volume of  starved bacterial strains and natural bacterial communities from the black sea were measured by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively, in  order to establish a relationship between light scattering and cell volume. results: with the arc-lamp flow cytometer, forward angle light scatter (fals) was related to cell size in both the starved strains and natural communities, although regression parameters differed. we tested the predictive capacity of the fals verous cell size relationship in a bacterial community from the north sea. that analysis showed that a reliable bacterial biovolume prediction of a natural  bacterial community can be obtained from fals using a model generated from natural bacterial community data. conclusions: bacterial biovolume is likely to be related to fals measurements. it is possible to establish a generally applicable model derived from natural bacterial assemblages for flow cytometric estimation of bacterial biovolumes by light scatter.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

AB  == the rpoh regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from genbank and compared. in addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoh of yersinia frederiksenii and proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters p1, p4 and p5, to the sigma(e) promoter p3 and to boxes dnaa1, dnaa2, camp receptor protein (crp) boxes crp1, crp2 and box cytr present in escherichia coli k12, were identified in sequences of closely related  bacteria such as: e.coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. in more distant bacteria, y.frederiksenii and p.mirabilis, the rpoh regulatory region has a distal p1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria.  this study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoh gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. a second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to e.coli.

AB  == shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic dna from morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the  pbkcmv cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, ppon-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampc, ampr, an hybf family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. the deduced ampc beta-lactamase of pi 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with ampc from citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. the overlapping promoter organization of ampc and ampr, although much shorter in m. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar ampr regulatory properties. the  mics of beta-lactams for e. coli mc4100 (ampc mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pacyc184 containing either ampc and ampr (pac-1) or ampc (pac-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampc gene of m. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampr and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. moreover, transformation of m. morganii 1 or of e. coli jrg582 (delta ampde) harboring ampc and ampr with a recombinant plasmid containing ampd from e. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam mics and an inducible phenotype for m. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an ampd-like protein in the regulation of the m. morganii cephalosporinase. fifteen other m. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase  expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampc-ampr organization, with the hybf and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the  organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampc-ampr genes in c. freundii and e. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. finally, an identical ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.

TI  == purification and characterization of wild-type and mutant "classical" nitroreductases of salmonella typhimurium. l33r mutation greatly diminishes binding of fmn to the nitroreductase of s. typhimurium.
AB  == "classical" nitroreductase of salmonella typhimurium is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of nitroaromatics to metabolites that are toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. this enzyme represents a new class of flavin-dependent enzymes, which includes nitroreductases of enterobacter cloacae  and escherichia coli, flavin oxidoreductase of vibrio fischeri, and nadh oxidase  of thermus thermophilus. to investigate the structure-function relation of this class of enzymes, the gene encoding a mutant nitroreductase was cloned from s. typhimurium strain ta1538nr, and the enzymatic properties were compared with those of the wild-type. dna sequence analysis revealed a t to g mutation in the mutant nitroreductase gene, predicting a replacement of leucine 33 with arginine. in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the purified protein with a mutation of leucine 33 to arginine has no detectable nitroreductase activities in the standard assay conditions and easily lost fmn by dialysis or ultrafiltration. in  the presence of an excess amount of fmn, however, the mutant protein exhibited a  weak but measurable enzyme activity, and the substrate specificity was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. possible mechanisms by which the mutation greatly diminishes binding of fmn to the nitroreductase are discussed.

TI  == the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected  by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.

TI  == characterization of a nosocomial outbreak involving an epidemic plasmid encoding  for tem-27 in salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype othmarschen.
AB  == a ceftazidime-resistant salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype othmarschen strain, harboring the plasmid-mediated new extended-spectrum beta-lactamase tem-27, was involved in a nosocomial outbreak (8 patients) at the  pediatric cardiology department of the ramon y cajal hospital in madrid. genomic  dna polymorphism analysis, using an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction, demonstrated the clonal nature of all salmonella isolates. the plasmid encoding tem-27 (pjmm1) was characterized by ecori, saci, and bgli restriction. an identical restriction pattern was found in plasmid from all s. enterica strains.  possible in vivo intergeneric plasmid spread was suggested by the identification  of an identical plasmid in escherichia coli ryc5h and enterobacter cloacae ryc39737 strains isolated during the outbreak. results indicate that this outbreak involved dissemination of a single ceftazidime-resistant salmonella strain and the spread of a single tem-27-encoding plasmid among different enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == the tryptophan repressor sequence is highly conserved among the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == tryptophan biosynthesis in escherichia coli is regulated by the product of the trpr gene, the tryptophan (trp) repressor. trp aporepressor binds the corepressor, l-tryptophan, to form a holorepressor complex, which binds trp operator dna tightly, and inhibits transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. the conservation of trp operator sequences among enteric gram-negative bacteria suggests that trpr genes from other bacterial species can be cloned by complementation in e. coli. to clone trpr homologues, a deletion of the e. coli trpr gene, delta trpr504, was made on a plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, then crossed onto the e. coli genome. plasmid clones of the trpr genes of enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae were isolated by complementation  of the delta trpr504 allele, scored as the ability to repress beta-galactosidase  synthesis from a prophage-borne trpe-lacz gene fusion. the predicted amino acid sequences of four enteric trpr proteins show differences, clustered on the backside of the folded repressor, opposite the dna-binding helix-turn-helix substructures. these differences are predicted to have little effect on the interactions of the aporepressor with tryptophan, holorepressor with operator dna, or tandemly bound holorepressor dimers with one another. although there is some variation observed at the dimer interface, interactions predicted to stabilize the interface are conserved. the phylogenetic relationships revealed by the trpr amino acid sequence alignment agree with the results of others.

TI  == the bioactivation of 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (cb1954)--i. purification and properties of a nitroreductase enzyme from escherichia coli--a potential enzyme for antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (adept).
AB  == a nitroreductase enzyme has been isolated from escherichia coli b. this enzyme is an fmn-containing flavoprotein with a molecular mass of 24 kda and requires either nadh or nadph as a cofactor. partial protein sequence analysis showed extensive homology with the "classical nitroreductase" of salmonella typhimurium  and a nitroreductase induced in enterobacter cloacae. in common with the salmonella enzyme, the e. coli b enzyme is capable of reducing nitrofurazone. the e. coli nitroreductase is also capable of reducing the anti-tumour agent cb1954 [5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide], a property shared with the mammalian enzyme dt diaphorase [nad(p)h dehydrogenase (quinone)] as isolated from walker cells. the reduction of cb1954 by the e. coli enzyme results in the generation of cytotoxic species. both enzymes also share the properties of being able to reduce quinones and are both inhibited by dicoumarol. the nitroreductase is a more active enzyme against cb1954 (kcat = 360 min-1) than walker dt diaphorase (kcat = 4 min-1) and also has a lower km for nadh (6 vs 75 microm).

TI  == some properties of serratia marcescens, salmonella paratyphi a, and enterobacter  cloacae with non-enzyme-dependent multiple resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, and quinolones.
AB  == non-enzyme-dependent multiple-drug resistance occurs preferentially in some genera of enterobacteriaceae, such as serratia, klebsiella, enterobacter, and salmonella. susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, quinolones, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol may be affected in various combinations in different mutants. proteins from the outer and inner membranes and lipopolysaccharides may be altered concomitantly. although porin alterations  have been observed in all resistant mutants studied, these modifications alone do not seem sufficient to explain the various cross-resistance phenotypes.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination in severe infections in adults].
AB  == timentin (ticarcillin (tcr) + clavulanic acid (ac)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). the following bacteria were recovered: 10 escherichia coli, 1 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 providencia stuartii, 1 salmonella typhi, 1 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. the sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (mics determined by agar dilution: tcr + ac 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; tcr + ac 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). thirteen strains were susceptible to tcr (mic less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 e. coli, 1 k. pneumoniae, and 1 s. aureus) were resistant  to tcr (mic greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. timentin was given in one-hour iv infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g x 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g x 2) in 6. duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). at termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin  and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == construction and comparison of recombinant plasmids encoding type 1 fimbriae of members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the genes encoding type 1 fimbriae of salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens were cloned in escherichia coli. all transformants possessing recombinant plasmids were shown to be fimbriate and demonstrated mannose-sensitive hemagglutinating activity. a comparison of the physical maps of these plasmids revealed little similarity among them, although plasmids encoding type 1 fimbriae of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae appeared similar with respect to restriction enzyme sites. the fimbrial gene cluster ranged in size from 5.5 to 9.0 kilobase pairs as determined by transposon mutagenesis. plasmid-containing e. coli strains were shown to produce species-specific fimbrial antigens with little or no cross-reactivity between genera. therefore, it was presumed that each plasmid contained the gene encoding  the fimbrial subunit. complementation was not detected between nonfimbriate insertion mutants of different species but was seen with mutants of the same species.

AB  == the combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of d-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. the results showed that all five strains of escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. similar results were  obtained with klebsiella pneumoniae. within the salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the e. coli strains. the combining sites of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of salmonella sp. and e. coli. the results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.
