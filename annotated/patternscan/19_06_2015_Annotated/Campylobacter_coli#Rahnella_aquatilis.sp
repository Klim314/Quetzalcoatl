TI  == development of a plating medium for selection of helicobacter pylori from water samples.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a simple plating medium to allow large-scale screening of water samples for the presence of helicobacter pylori. five conventional plating media (brain heart infusion, brucella agar, columbia blood agar base, campylobacter agar kit skirrow, and hpspa medium), each containing a commercial antibiotic supplement, were initially evaluated. eight strains selected as common waterborne organisms (acinetobacter, aeromonas, bacillus, escherichia coli, enterobacter, enterococcus, helicobacter pylori, and  pseudomonas strains) were individually plated onto each of these media. three organisms (acinetobacter, e. coli, and h. pylori) were able to grow on all five media. this growth was unacceptable since helicobacter grows very slowly and competing organisms must be inhibited for up to 7 days. therefore, a more selective medium (hp agar) containing a novel mixture of growth supplements plus  amphotericin b and polymyxin b was developed. this medium also included a phenol  red color indicator for urease production. aliquots of nonsterile well water that contained native flora (flavobacterium, serratia, citrobacter, pasteurella, ochrobactrum, rahnella, and unidentified molds) and were further adulterated with the eight strains listed above (10(6) cfu of each strain per 100 ml) were spiked  with h. pylori and were plated. in spite of the heavy mixed microbial load, only  h. pylori colonies grew during 7 days of incubation at 37 degrees c. the color indicator system allowed presumptive identification of h. pylori colonies sooner  (12 to 20 h) than the conventional media tested allowed. the hp formulation developed in this study provides a medium with superior selectivity for h. pylori from mixed microbial populations in water and reduces the time required to complete the assay.
