TI  == technological properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from pico cheese an artisanal cow's milk cheese.
AB  == aim: evaluate technologically relevant properties from bacteriocin-producing strains to use as starter/adjunct cultures in cheese making. methods and results: eight isolates obtained from pico cheese produced in azores (portugal) were found to produce bacteriocins against listeria monocytogenes and three isolates against clostridium perfringens. they were identified as lactococcus lactis and enterococcus faecalis and submitted to technological tests: growth at different conditions of temperature and salt, acid production, proteolysis, lipolysis, coexistence, enzymatic profile and autolytic capacity. safety evaluation was performed by evaluating haemolytic, gelatinase and dnase activity, resistance to  antibiotics and the presence of virulence genes. some isolates presented good technological features such as high autolytic activity, acid and diacetyl production. lactococcus lactis was negative for all virulence genes tested and inhibit the growth of all lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates. enterococci were positive for the presence of some virulence genes, but none of the isolates were  classified as resistant to important antibiotics. conclusions: the bacteriocin-producing lc. lactis present good potential for application in food as adjunct culture in cheese production. the study also reveals good technological features for some enterococcus isolates. significance and impact of the study: bacteriocin-producing strains presented important technological properties to be exploited as new adjunct culture for the dairy industry, influencing flavour development and improve safety.

TI  == expression and delivery of an endolysin to combat clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is a cause for increasing concern due to its responsibility for severe infections both in humans and animals, especially poultry. to find new control strategies to treat c. perfringens infection, we investigated the activity and delivery of a bacteriophage endolysin. we identified a new endolysin, designated cp25l, which shows similarity to an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain and is distinct from other c. perfringens endolysins whose activity has been demonstrated in vitro. the cp25l gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the gene product demonstrated lytic activity against all 25 c. perfringens strains tested. the probiotic strain lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 was engineered to deliver the endolysin to the gastrointestinal tract. the integration of the nisrk two-component regulatory system from the lactococcus lactis nisin a biosynthesis  operon into the chromosome of l. johnsonii allowed constitutive expression of the endolysin under the control of the nisa promoter (p nisa ), while the use of a signal peptide (slpmod) led to successful secretion of the active endolysin to the surrounding media. the high specificity and activity of the endolysin suggest that it may be developed as an effective tool to enhance the control of c. perfringens by l. johnsonii in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == safety and risk assessment of the genetically modified lactococci on rats intestinal bacterial flora.
AB  == the interaction between lactococcus lactis nz9000/pnzpnk and intestinal microflora was evaluated as a method to assess safety of genetically modified microorganisms (gmms). l. lactis nz9000/pnzpnk is one kind of gmm and able to produce the intracellular subtilisin nat (nattokinase) under induction with nisin. the host strain l. lactis nz9000 was a generally recognized as safe (gras) microorganism. six groups of wistar rats were orally administered with l. lactis  nz9000/pnzpnk and l. lactis nz9000 for 6 weeks. fecal and cecal contents were collected to determine the number of l. lactis nz9000, l. lactis nz9000/pnzpnk, lactobacillus, coliform bacteria, beneficial bacteria bifidobacterium and harmful bacteria clostridium perfringens. the liver, spleen, kidney and blood were evaluated for the bacterial translocation. after 6 weeks consumption with gm and  non-gm lactococcus, no adverse effects were observed on the rat's body weight, hematological or serum biochemical parameters, or intestinal microflora. the bacterial translocation test showed that l. lactis nz9000/pnzpnk did not translocate to any organ or blood. bifidobacterium was significantly increased in feces after administration of both lactococcus strains (l. lactis nz9000 and l. lactis nz9000/pnzpnk), while c. perfringens remained undetectable during the experiment. these results suggested that l. lactis nz9000/pnzpnk could be safe in animal experiments and monitoring of the interaction between test strains and intestinal microflora might be applied as a method for other gmm safety assessments.

TI  == heterologous production and secretion of clostridium perfringens beta-toxoid in closely related gram-positive hosts.
AB  == the spore forming bacterium clostridium perfringens is a widely occurring pathogen. vaccines against c. perfringens type b and c are currently manufactured using beta-toxin secreted by virulent c. perfringens strains. large-scale production of vaccines from virulent strains requires stringent safety conditions and costly detoxification and control steps. therefore, it would be beneficial to produce this toxin in a safe production host and in an immunogenic, but non-toxic form (toxoid). for high-level expression of beta-toxoid, we cloned the highly active ribosomal rpsf promoter of bacillus subtilis in a broad host range multicopy plasmid. in b. subtilis, we obtained high intracellular production, up  to 200 microg ml(-1) culture. however, the beta-toxoid was poorly secreted. the employed rpsf expression system allowed using the same expression plasmids in other heterologous hosts such as lactococcus lactis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in these organisms secretion of beta-toxoid was ten times higher compared to the  best producing b. subtilis strain. these results show the usefulness of the rpsf  based broad host range expression system.

TI  == microarray-based detection of 90 antibiotic resistance genes of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a disposable microarray was developed for detection of up to 90 antibiotic resistance genes in gram-positive bacteria by hybridization. each antibiotic resistance gene is represented by two specific oligonucleotides chosen from consensus sequences of gene families, except for nine genes for which only one specific oligonucleotide could be developed. a total of 137 oligonucleotides (26  to 33 nucleotides in length with similar physicochemical parameters) were spotted onto the microarray. the microarrays (arraytubes) were hybridized with 36 strains carrying specific antibiotic resistance genes that allowed testing of the sensitivity and specificity of 125 oligonucleotides. among these were well-characterized multidrug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus lactis and an avirulent strain of bacillus  anthracis harboring the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pre25. analysis of two multidrug-resistant field strains allowed the detection of 12 different antibiotic resistance genes in a staphylococcus haemolyticus strain isolated from mastitis milk and 6 resistance genes in a clostridium perfringens strain isolated from a calf. in both cases, the microarray genotyping corresponded to the phenotype of the strains. the arraytube platform presents the advantage of rapidly screening bacteria for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes known  in gram-positive bacteria. this technology has a large potential for applications in basic research, food safety, and surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of streptococcus suis.
AB  == in our continued effort to search for a streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of s. suis type 2. a clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized  within a 2.0-kbp ecori dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kda. by in vitro protein synthesis and western  blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kda. at the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from streptococcus pneumoniae (89%),  streptococcus mutans (86%), lactococcus lactis (80%), listeria monocytogenes (74%), and clostridium perfringens (64%). except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in  strains of other s. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the ecori recognition sequence. we confirmed expression of the 38-kda protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. the recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of s. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most s. suis infections. pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kda protein mounted antibody responses to  the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of s. suis type 2, suggesting  that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against s. suis infection. analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. the functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic s. suis capsular  types remains to be determined.

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression among low g+c gram-positive genomes.
AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == identification and characteristics of nisin z-producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from kimchi.
AB  == we isolated bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis from kimchi. the bacteriocin inhibited strains of clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, listeria monocytogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and one out of four methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as some closely related lactic acid bacteria. in tricine-sds-page, the bacteriocin migrated with  an apparent molecular weight of about 4 kda to the same location as nisin a and crude nisin z. the gene encoding this bacteriocin was found to be identical to that of nisin z with direct pcr sequence methods. the inhibitory activity was stable against heat and ph, but it was lost at 100 degrees c for 1 h and at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but was not affected by lysozyme, lipase, catalase, or beta-glucosidase. there were some differences in characteristics from those of nisins described previously.

TI  == isolation of nisin-producing lactococcus lactis wnc 20 strain from nham, a traditional thai fermented sausage.
AB  == a total of 14,020 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from nham and screened for bacteriocin production. one lactococcus lactis strain wnc 20 produced a bacteriocin that not only inhibited closely related lab, but also some food-borne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. biochemical studies revealed that the bacteriocin was heat-stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees c for 15 min) and was active over a wide ph range (2-10). the bacteriocin was inactivated  by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase k but not other proteases. the antimicrobial spectrum and some characteristics of this bacteriocin were nearly identical to that of nisin. the gene encoding this bacteriocin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with nisin gene-specific primer. sequencing of this gene showed identical sequences to nisin z as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. the ability of the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis wnc 20 may be useful in improving the food safety of the fermented product.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.

TI  == an effective lacticin biopreservative in fresh pork sausage.
AB  == lacticin 3147 is a novel heat-stable bacteriocin, produced by lactococcus lactis  dpc 3147, that exhibits a broad-range inhibition spectrum similar to nisin. in this study, the effect of lacticin 3147 and nisin on the shelf life of fresh pork sausage and their ability to control pathogens (clostridium perfringens dsm 756,  salmonella kentucky at1) and nonpathogenic listeria innocua dpc 1770 was investigated. the following preservative regimens were evaluated, both in broth and sausage systems: (i) 450 ppm of sodium metabisulphite; (ii) 500 iu g(-1) or ml(-1) of nisin, (iii) 2500 arbitary units (au) g(-1) or ml(-1) of lacticin 3147; (iv) 2% sodium lactate and 500 iu of nisin; (v) 2% sodium citrate and 500 iu g(-1) or ml(-1) of nisin; (vi) 2% sodium lactate and 2500 au g(-1) or ml(-1) of lacticin 3147, (vii) 2% sodium citrate and 2500 au g(-1) or ml(-1) of lacticin 3147, (viii) 2% sodium lactate, and (ix) 2% sodium citrate. there was no significant difference in the activity of nisin and lacticin 3147 against any of  the target strains used, both bacteriocins performing significantly better than sodium metabisulfite against gram-positive strains in broth systems. trends indicate that the combination of organic acids with either bacteriocin enhanced its activity against salmonella kentucky and l. innocua and was particularly effective in the inhibition of c. perfringens in fresh pork sausage. in addition, lacticin 3147 combined with either sodium citrate or sodium lactate maintained significantly lower (p < 0.05) total aerobic plate counts for the duration of the trials and may function as an alternative to sodium metabisulfite in the preservation of fresh pork sausage.

TI  == occurrence of nisin z production in lactococcus lactis bfe 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional nigerian cheese product.
AB  == screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from various african fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing lactococcus lactis (bfe 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. the bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related lab, but also strains of listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, clostridium butyricum, clostridium perfringens, bacillis cereus and staphylococcus aureus. it was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees c for 15 min) and was active  over a wide ph range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower ph range. the bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase k, but not by other proteases. growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 on l. monocytogenes ws 2250 and b. cereus dsm 2301 than with the nisin a producing strain dsm 20729.  polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain bfe 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that lc. lactis bfe 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin z, as indicated by the substitution of  asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. the genetic determinants  for bacteriocin production in strain bfe 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. the ability of the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the african environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
