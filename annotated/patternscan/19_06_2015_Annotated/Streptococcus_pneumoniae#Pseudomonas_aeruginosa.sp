TI  == bacteremia among febrile ugandan children treated with antimalarials despite a negative malaria test.
AB  == bacteremia may be inappropriately treated as malaria in children admitted with a  febrile illness in africa. we determined the prevalence, clinical features, and spectrum of bacteremia among febrile children younger than 5 years of age admitted with a negative malaria test, but prescribed antimalarials at a referral hospital in jinja, uganda. after initial evaluation, a blood sample was drawn from 250 children for a complete blood count and bacterial culture. of 250 samples cultured, 15 grew organisms presumed to be skin contaminants, and of the  remaining 235 samples, 45 (19.1%) had bacteremia. staphylococcus aureus (42%), non-typhoidal salmonella (24%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9%) were the most common bacterial isolates. on multivariate analysis, history of weight loss (odds ratio [or] = 2.75; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.27-5.95), presence of pulmonary crackles (or = 3.63; 95% ci = 1.40-9.45), and leukocytosis (or = 2.21; 95% ci = 1.09-4.47) were independent predictors of bacteremia. at a referral hospital in uganda, bacteremia was a remarkably common finding in children with febrile illness who were treated for malaria despite negative malaria test results.

TI  == destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification  of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. however, before raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. in this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for raman spectroscopic identification. prior to the isolation, a  liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture pronase e is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. the extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with  6.107 to 6.104 cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus. the compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a classification of single-cell raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (pca) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (lda). these  classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. graphical abstract development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.

TI  == clinical characteristics of pneumonia in bedridden patients receiving home care:  a 3-year prospective observational study.
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology, clinical features, antimicrobial treatment, and outcomes of bedridden pneumonia patients receiving home healthcare. methods: a 3-year prospective observational study of poor performance status (ps) 3-4 patients receiving long-term home healthcare and hospitalized at a single center with pneumonia between october 2010 and september 2013 was conducted, and their clinical characteristics were compared with non-bedridden community-acquired pneumonia (cap) patients. results: a total of 131 cap patients with ps 3-4, and 400 cap patients with ps 0-2 were evaluated. the ps 3-4 patients were older, and exhibited a higher frequency of underlying diseases. aspiration was thought to be associated with pneumonia in 77.1% of the  ps 3-4 patients. streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in both groups, whereas the frequency of streptococci and polymicrobial infections was higher in the ps 3-4 group. the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than in previous healthcare-associated pneumonia reports. the in-hospital mortality and recurrence rates were significantly higher in the ps 3-4 group than in the good ps group (17.6% vs. 6.0%, p < 0.001 and 15.3% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.008, respectively). conclusions: the clinical characteristics of pneumonia in poor ps patients were similar to healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap), except for the frequency of drug-resistant pathogens. hence, it might be  beneficial to categorize pneumonia in home residents with poor ps separately from pneumonia in cap patients who were previously healthy or experienced mild comorbidities.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == cxcl14 displays antimicrobial activity against respiratory tract bacteria and contributes to clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae pulmonary infection.
AB  == cxcl14 is a chemokine with an atypical, yet highly conserved, primary structure characterized by a short n terminus and high sequence identity between human and  mouse. although it induces chemotaxis of monocytic cells at high concentrations,  its physiological role in leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. in contrast, several studies have demonstrated that cxcl14 is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide that is expressed abundantly and constitutively in epithelial tissues. in this study, we further explored the antimicrobial properties of cxcl14 against respiratory pathogens in vitro and in vivo. we found that cxcl14 potently killed  pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus pneumoniae in a dose-dependent manner in part through membrane depolarization and rupture. by performing structure-activity studies, we found that the activity against gram-negative bacteria was largely associated with the n-terminal peptide cxcl141-13. interestingly, the central part of the molecule representing the beta-sheet also maintained approximately 62% killing activity and was sufficient  to induce chemotaxis of thp-1 cells. the c-terminal alpha-helix of cxcl14 had neither antimicrobial nor chemotactic effect. to investigate a physiological function for cxcl14 in innate immunity in vivo, we infected cxcl14-deficient mice with lung pathogens and we found that cxcl14 contributed to enhanced clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. our comprehensive studies reflect the complex bactericidal mechanisms of cxcl14, and we propose that different structural features are relevant for the killing of gram-negative  and gram-positive bacteria. taken together, our studies show that evolutionary-conserved features of cxcl14 are important for constitutive antimicrobial defenses against pneumonia.

TI  == changes in cystic fibrosis airway microbial community associated with a severe decline in lung function.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) is a genetic disease resulting in chronic polymicrobial infections of the airways and progressive decline in lung function. to gain insight into the underlying causes of severe lung diseases, we aimed at comparing the airway microbiota detected in sputum of cf patients with stable lung function (s) versus those with a substantial decline in lung function (sd). microbiota composition was investigated by using culture-based and culture-independent methods, and by performing multivariate and statistical analyses. culture-based methods identified some microbial species associated with a worse lung function,  i.e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, rothia mucilaginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae and candida albicans, but only the presence of s. pneumoniae and r. mucilaginosa was  found to be associated with increased severe decline in forced expiratory volume  in 1 second (fev1). terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis revealed a higher bacterial diversity than that detected by culture-based methods. molecular signatures with a statistically significant odds ratio for sd status were detected, and classified as pseudomonas, burkholderia and shewanella, while for other terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) no species assignation was achieved. the analysis of t-rflp data using ecological biodiversity indices showed reduced evenness in sd patients compared to s ones, suggesting an impaired ecology of the bacterial community in sd patients. statistically significant differences of the ecological biodiversity indices among the three sub-groups of fev1 (normal/mild vs moderate vs severe) were also  found, suggesting that the patients with moderate lung disease experienced changes in the airway assembly of taxa. overall, changes in cf airway microbial community associated with a severe lung function decline were detected, allowing  us to define some discriminatory species as well as some discriminatory t-rfs that represent good candidates for the development of predictive biomarkers of substantial decline in lung function.

TI  == ceftaroline in the management of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and  community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == ceftaroline is a new parenteral cephalosporin approved by the european medicines  agency (ema) and the us food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csstis) including those due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and exerts its bactericidal effects by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), resulting in inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. it binds to pbp 2a of mrsa with high affinity and also binds to all six pbps in streptococcus pneumoniae. in in vitro studies, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity against staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa and vancomycin-intermediate isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multidrug  resistant isolates), haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and many common gram-negative pathogens, excluding extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in phase ii and phase iii clinical trials, ceftaroline was noninferior to its comparator agents and demonstrated high clinical cure rates in the treatment of csstis and cap. it  demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients treated for both regulatory-approved  indications and unlicensed indications in a retrospective analysis. ceftaroline is a safe and effective option for treatment in specific patient populations in which its efficacy and safety have been proven. this article reviews the challenges in the treatment of cssti and cap, ceftaroline and its microbiology, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety data which support its use in treatment of csstis and cap.

TI  == microbiology and outcomes of community acquired pneumonia in non cystic-fibrosis  bronchiectasis patients.
AB  == background: it is general belief that non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (ncfb) is characterized by frequent community-acquired pneumonia. nonetheless, the knowledge on clinical characteristics of cap in ncfbe is poor and no specific recommendations are available. we aim to investigate clinical and microbiological characteristics of ncfbe patients with cap. methods: prospective observational study of 3495 cap patients (2000-2011). results: we found 90 (2.0%) ncfbe-cap that in comparison with non-bronchiectatic cap (n, 3405) showed older age (mean +/- [sd], ncfbe-cap 73 +/- 14 vs. cap 65 +/- 19yrs), more vaccinations (pneumococcal: 35% vs. 14%; influenza: 60% vs. 42%), comorbidities (n >/= 2: 43%  vs. 25%), previous antibiotics (38% vs. 22%), and inhaled steroids (53% vs. 16%)  (p < 0.05 each). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent isolate in both groups (ncfbe-cap 44.4% vs. cap 42.7%; p = 0.821) followed by respiratory virus,  mixed infections and atypical bacteria. considering overall frequencies of the main pathogens (including monomicrobial and mixed infections) pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5% vs. 2.9%; p < 0.001) and enterobacteriaceae (8.8% vs. 2.4%; p = 0.025) were more prevalent in ncfbe-cap patients than in cap. despite these clinical and microbiological differences, ncfbe-cap showed similar outcomes to cap patients (mortality, length of hospital stay, etc.). conclusions: ncfbe-cap patients are usually older and have more comorbidities but similar outcomes than  general cap population. usual cap pathogens, such as s. pneumoniae, are also involved in ncfbe-cap but p. aeruginosa and other enterobacteriaceae were globally more frequent than in cap. therefore, a wide microbiological investigation should be recommended in all ncfbe-cap cases as well as routine pneumococcal vaccination for prevention of pneumonia.

TI  == mycoplasma iowae: relationships among oxygen, virulence, and protection from oxidative stress.
AB  == the poultry-associated bacterium mycoplasma iowae colonizes multiple sites in embryos, with disease or death resulting. although m. iowae accumulates in the intestinal tract, it does not cause disease at that site, but rather only in tissues that are exposed to atmospheric o2. the activity of m. iowae catalase, encoded by kate, is capable of rapid removal of damaging h2o2 from solution, and  kate confers a substantial reduction in the amount of h2o2 produced by mycoplasma gallisepticum kate transformants in the presence of glycerol. as catalase-producing bacteria are often beneficial to hosts with inflammatory bowel disease, we explored whether m. iowae was exclusively protective against h2o2-producing bacteria in a caenorhabditis elegans model, whether its protectiveness changed in response to o2 levels, and whether expression of genes  involved in h2o2 metabolism and virulence changed in response to o2 levels. we observed that m. iowae was in fact protective against h2o2-producing streptococcus pneumoniae, but not hcn-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that  m. iowae cells grown in 1% o2 promoted survival of c. elegans to a greater extent than m. iowae cells grown in atmospheric o2. transcript levels of an m. iowae gene encoding a homolog of mycoplasma pneumoniae cards toxin were 5-fold lower in cells grown in low o2. these data suggest that reduced o2, representing the intestinal environment, triggers m. iowae to reduce its virulence capabilities, effecting a change from a pathogenic mode to a potentially beneficial one.

TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes: prevalence of bacteria and viruses in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era.
AB  == background: acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is a common sequela in children with tympanostomy tubes. acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is generally a symptom of an acute middle ear infection, whereby middle ear fluid drains through the tube. the widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (pcv) has changed the bacterial prevalence in the upper respiratory tract of children, but its impact on bacterial and viral pathogens causing acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea is yet  unknown. methods: this study was performed in the post-pcv7 era parallel to a randomized clinical trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ototopical and systemic antibiotics and initial observation in 230 children aged 1 to 10 years with untreated, uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. otorrhea and nasopharyngeal samples were collected at baseline (before treatment) and at 2 weeks (after treatment). conventional bacterial culture was performed followed by antimicrobial-resistance assessment. viruses were identified by polymerase chain  reaction. results: at baseline, haemophilus influenzae (41%), staphylococcus aureus (40%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (18%) were the most prevalent bacteria in otorrhea, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (7%) and moraxella catarrhalis (4%). most pneumococci were non-pcv7 serotypes. viruses were detected in 45 otorrhea samples at baseline (21%). most infections were polymicrobial and overall antimicrobial resistance was low. conclusions: h. influenzae, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa are the most common microorganisms in children with untreated uncomplicated acute tympanostomy-tube otorrhea. prevalence of s. pneumoniae has decreased since the introduction of pcv and most pneumococci are nonvaccine serotypes.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == rapid microbial sample preparation from blood using a novel concentration device.
AB  == appropriate care for bacteremic patients is dictated by the amount of time needed for an accurate diagnosis. however, the concentration of microbes in the blood is extremely low in these patients (1-100 cfu/ml), traditionally requiring growth (blood culture) or amplification (e.g., pcr) for detection. current culture-based methods can take a minimum of two days, while faster methods like pcr require a sample free of inhibitors (i.e., blood components). though commercial kits exist  for the removal of blood from these samples, they typically capture only dna, thereby necessitating the use of blood culture for antimicrobial testing. here, we report a novel, scaled-up sample preparation protocol carried out in a new microbial concentration device. the process can efficiently lyse 10 ml of bacteremic blood while maintaining the microorganisms' viability, giving a 30-mul final output volume. a suite of six microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) at a range of clinically relevant concentrations was tested. all of the microorganisms had recoveries greater than  55% at the highest tested concentration of 100 cfu/ml, with three of them having  over 70% recovery. at the lowest tested concentration of 3 cfu/ml, two microorganisms had recoveries of ca. 40-50% while the other four gave recoveries  greater than 70%. using a taqman assay for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa)to prove the feasibility of downstream analysis, we show that our microbial pellets are clean enough for pcr amplification. pcr testing of 56 spiked-positive and negative samples gave a specificity of 0.97 and a sensitivity of 0.96, showing that our sample preparation protocol holds great promise for the rapid diagnosis of bacteremia directly from a primary sample.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of otitis media in children in pakistan aged 0-59 months; laboratory surveillance data from 2004 to 2013: comparison between before and after the introduction of hib vaccination.
AB  == background: otitis media (om) is a leading cause of childhood illness. in pakistan, the estimated incidence of om-associated hearing impairment is >40/10,000 population and om-associated mortality is 50-79.9/10x106 population. no om microbiology data are available from pakistan since 2004. objectives: to describe the microbiology of om in children aged 0-59 months in pakistan. methods: laboratory data on ear pus specimens taken from children seen between 2004 and 2013 were retrieved from the laboratory information systems of the aga khan university and entered into microsoft excel and spss version 16.0. results:  bacterial culture results from 277 specimens were analysed. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the organisms most commonly isolated, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. polymicrobial cultures significantly increased in the post-hib vaccination period from 19.5% to 32.7% (p = 0.038). h. influenzae also increased significantly from 16.8% to 24.5% (p = 0.038). conclusions: an increase in h. influenzae may reflect non-b capsular types (not determined in the study), or even capsular types from areas with low vaccine coverage. increases in polymicrobial cultures and h. influenzae warrant further study.

TI  == bacteraemia and antibiotic-resistant pathogens in community acquired pneumonia: risk and prognosis.
AB  == the sensitivity of blood cultures in the diagnosis of bacteraemia for community-acquired pneumonia is low. recommendations, by guidelines, to perform blood cultures are discordant. we aimed to determine the incidence, microbial aetiology, risk factors and outcomes of bacteraemic patients with community-acquired pneumonia, including cases with antibiotic-resistant pathogens (arp). a prospective, observational study was undertaken on consecutive adult patients admitted to the hospital clinic of barcelona (barcelona, spain) with community-acquired pneumonia and blood cultures were obtained. of the 2892 patients included, bacteraemia was present in 297 (10%) patients; 30 (10%) of whom had arp (multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an extended spectrum of beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae). in multivariate analyses, pleuritic pain, c-reactive protein >/=21.6 mg.dl(-1) and intensive care unit admissions were independently associated with bacteraemia, while prior antibiotic treatment  and pneumococcal vaccine were protective factors. the risk factors for arp bacteraemia were previous antibiotics and c-reactive protein <22.2 mg.dl(-1), while pleuritic pain was the only protective factor in the multivariate analysis. bacteraemia (excluding arp), appropriate empiric treatment, neurological disease, arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction <250, pneumonia severity index risk classes iv and v, and intensive care unit admission were independently associated with a 30-day hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis. inappropriate therapy was more frequent in arp bacteraemia, compared with other bacteraemias (27% versus 3%, respectively, p<0.001). antibiotic therapy protected against bacteraemia, but increased specifically the risk of bacteraemia from arp  due to the inappropriate coverage of these pathogens. identifying patients at risk of arp bacteraemia would help in deciding appropriate empiric antimicrobial  therapy. the results from this study provide evidence concerning community-acquired pneumonia patients in whom blood cultures should not be performed.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

TI  == a recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin recognizes specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns of bacteria through rhamnose.
AB  == horseshoe crab is an ancient marine arthropod that, in the absence of a vertebrate-like immune system, relies solely on innate immune responses by defense molecules found in hemolymph plasma and granular hemocytes for host defense. a plasma lectin isolated from the hemolymph of taiwanese tachypleus tridentatus recognizes bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lpss), yet its structure and mechanism of action remain unclear, largely because of limited availability of horseshoe crabs and the lack of a heterogeneous expression system. in this study, we have successfully expressed and purified a soluble and functional recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin (rhpl) in an escherichia coli system. interestingly, rhpl bound not only to bacteria and lpss like the native hpl but also to selective medically important pathogens isolated from clinical specimens, such as gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae and gram-positive streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. the binding was demonstrated to occur through a specific molecular interaction with rhamnose in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) on the bacterial surface. additionally, rhpl inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa pao1 in a concentration-dependent manner. the results suggest that a specific protein-glycan interaction between rhpl and rhamnosyl residue may further facilitate development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for microbial pathogens.

TI  == eotaxin-3 (ccl26) exerts innate host defense activities that are modulated by mast cell proteases.
AB  == background: during bacterial infections of the airways, a th1-profiled inflammation promotes the production of several host defense proteins and peptides with antibacterial activities including beta-defensins, elr-negative cxc chemokines, and the cathelicidin ll-37. these are downregulated by th2 cytokines  of the allergic response. instead, the eosinophil-recruiting chemokines eotaxin-1/ccl11, eotaxin-2/ccl24, and eotaxin-3/ccl26 are expressed. this study set out to investigate whether these chemokines could serve as innate host defense molecules during allergic inflammation. methods: antibacterial activities of the eotaxins were investigated using viable count assays, electron microscopy, and methods assessing bacterial permeabilization. fragments generated by mast cell proteases were characterized, and their potential antibacterial, receptor-activating, and lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing activities were investigated. results: ccl11, ccl24, and ccl26 all showed potent bactericidal activity, mediated through membrane disruption, against the airway pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ccl26 retained bactericidal activity in the presence of salt at physiologic concentrations, and the region holding the highest bactericidal activity was the cationic and amphipathic cooh-terminus. proteolysis of ccl26 by chymase and tryptase, respectively, released distinct fragments of the cooh- and nh2 -terminal regions. the cooh-terminal fragment retained antibacterial activity while the nh2 -terminal had potent lps-neutralizing properties in the order of ccl26 full-length protein. an identical fragment to nh2 -terminal fragment generated by tryptase was obtained after incubation with supernatants from activated mast cells. none of the fragments activated the ccr3-receptor. conclusions: taken together, the findings  show that the eotaxins can contribute to host defense against common airway pathogens and that their activities are modulated by mast cell proteases.

TI  == differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and ricu.
AB  == background: lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. this study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lrtis. methods: the clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 lrti patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) of xiangya hospital (changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. results: the infection rate of gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and ricu (p<0.05). the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05), whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection  is less in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05). in the general ward, the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (p<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (p<0.05). in the ricu, the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (p>0.05). staphylococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and ricu (41.66-54.87%), respectively (p>0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and ricu (29.60-33.88%), respectively (p>0.05). streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. conclusions: the distribution and drug sensitivity of lrti pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and ricu. streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in lrtis in some areas of china.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == validation of sputum gram stain for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia: a prospective observational study.
AB  == background: the usefulness of sputum gram stain in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is controversial. there has been no study to evaluate the diagnostic value of this method in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap). the purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of sputum gram stain in etiological diagnosis and pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of cap and hcap. methods: we conducted a prospective observational study on hospitalized patients with pneumonia admitted  to our hospital from august 2010 to july 2012. before administering antibiotics on admission, gram stain was performed and examined by trained physicians immediately after sputum samples were obtained. we analyzed the quality of sputum samples and the diagnostic performance of gram stain. we also compared pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment guided by sputum gram stain with empirical treatment. results: of 670 patients with pneumonia, 328 were cap and 342 were hcap. sputum samples were obtained from 591 patients, of these 478 samples were good quality. the sensitivity and specificity of sputum gram stain were 62.5% and 91.5% for streptococcus pneumoniae, 60.9% and 95.1% for haemophilus influenzae, 68.2% and 96.1% for moraxella catarrhalis, 39.5% and 98.2% for klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.2% and 99.8% for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9.1% and 100% for staphylococcus aureus. the diagnostic yield decreased in patients who had received antibiotics or patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. pathogen-targeted treatment provided similar efficacy with a decrease in adverse  events compared to empirical treatment. conclusions: sputum gram stain is highly  specific for the etiologic diagnosis and useful in guiding pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of cap and hcap.

TI  == early respiratory infection is associated with reduced spirometry in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == rationale: pulmonary inflammation, infection, and structural lung disease occur early in life in children with cystic fibrosis. objectives: we hypothesized that  the presence of these markers of cystic fibrosis lung disease in the first 2 years of life would be associated with reduced lung function in childhood. methods: lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first three-quarters of a second [fev0.75], fvc) was assessed in individuals with cystic fibrosis diagnosed after newborn screening and healthy subjects during infancy (0-2 yr) and again at early school age (4-8 yr). individuals with cystic fibrosis underwent annual bronchoalveolar lavage fluid examination, and chest computed tomography. we examined which clinical outcomes (pulmonary inflammation, infection, structural lung disease, respiratory hospitalizations, antibiotic prophylaxis) measured in the first 2 years of life were associated with reduced lung function in infants and young children with cystic fibrosis, using a mixed effects model. measurements and main results: children with cystic fibrosis (n = 56) had 8.3% (95% confidence interval [ci], -15.9 to -6.6; p = 0.04) lower fev0.75 compared with healthy subjects (n = 18). detection of proinflammatory bacterial pathogens  (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, aspergillus species, streptococcus pneumoniae) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was associated with clinically significant reductions in fev0.75 (ranging between 11.3 and 15.6%). conclusions: the onset of lung disease in infancy, specifically  the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infection, is associated with low lung  function in young children with cystic fibrosis. deficits in lung function measured in infancy persist into childhood, emphasizing the need for targeted therapeutic interventions in infancy to maximize functional outcomes later in life.

TI  == bacteriology in relation to clinical findings and treatment of acute mastoiditis  in children.
AB  == objective: we assessed clinical, radiological, laboratory and microbiological findings in children with acute mastoiditis in order to improve the diagnostics and treatment of these patients. we also investigated whether different pathogens cause different clinical findings of mastoiditis. methods: a retrospective review of the medical records of all children aged 0-16 years treated as in-ward patients for acute mastoiditis at helsinki university central hospital, department of otorhinolaryngology, between 2003 and 2012. results: fifty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. the incidence of mastoiditis was 1.88/100000/year. the most common pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (38%),  streptococcus pyogenes (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%). of s. pneumoniae,  48% had reduced susceptibility (intermediate or resistant) for the common antimicrobials; this was clearly overrepresented relative to the background population (p<0.001). otalgia and retroauricular symptoms were common in the patients with s. pneumoniae. otorrhoea was less common (p=0.03) in these patients relative to the other pathogens. patients with s. pneumoniae had more destruction of the mastoid septa (p=0.05) than patients with any of the other pathogens. mastoidectomy was performed in 34% of all cases, it was most common (60%) in the  patients with s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility. the patients with s. pyogenes had less otalgia and seemed to have less retroauricular symptoms relative to other pathogens. p. aeruginosa especially affected children with tympanostomy tubes, caused otorrhoea in all patients and caused a milder form of  disease with less retroauricular swelling (p=0.04) than the other pathogens, and  there was no need for mastoidectomies. the younger children (<2 years) had less otorrhoea and more retroauricular symptoms of infection than the older patients.  no significant differences emerged in outcome of the patient groups. conclusions: the clinical findings of acute mastoiditis differ according to the causative pathogen. s. pneumoniae, especially strains with reduced susceptibility, causes severe symptoms and leads to mastoidectomy more often than the other pathogens. s. pyogenes causes less otalgia than the other pathogens. p. aeruginosa particularly affects children with tympanostomy tubes and causes a less aggressive form of disease.

TI  == false negative beta-2 transferrin in the diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leak in the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: the objectives of this study were to examine the presence  of beta-2 transferrin (beta2trnsf) in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) contaminated in vitro by various bacteria and explore the mechanism (passive or active) responsible for beta2trnsf elimination. early diagnosis of csf leakage may change treatment decisions and minimize the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. beta2trnsf is a protein present exclusively in csf. its detection is highly useful in cases of csf leakage, although it has never been examined in the presence of central nervous system infection. study design: prospective patient analysis. methods: sterile csf drawn from patients was contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms chosen for their ability to cause neurosurgical-related infections: streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. beta2trnsf was examined at two time points: following immediate inoculation (t0) and following an overnight incubation (t18) over various bacterial concentrations. samples of csf inoculated with s pneumoniae were also examined in the presence of ciprofloxacin. for beta2trnsf analysis we used immunoblotting electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: csf samples collected from nine patients were analyzed. beta2trnsf was not detected following s pneumoniae inoculation at both time points when immunoblotting electrophoresis was used. quantitative analysis using elisa demonstrated significant beta2trnsf concentration decrease. the addition of ciprofloxacin led to the same results. conclusions: csf leak detection using beta2trnsf may be deceiving in the presence of a s pneumoniae cerebral nervous system infection. a passive process is suggested, as beta2trnsf disappeared either immediately or following incubation with inactive bacteria.

TI  == community acquired bacterial pneumonia: aetiology, laboratory detection and antibiotic susceptibility pattern.
AB  == this cross sectional study was conducted to identify the common bacterial causes  of community acquired pneumonia (cap) from sputum and blood by culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and to evaluate the effectiveness of these tests. a total of 105 sputum and blood samples were collected from patients with pneumonia on clinical suspicion. common causative bacterial agents of pneumonia were detected by gram staining, cultures, biochemical tests and pcr. among 55 sputum culture positive cases, a majority (61.82%) of the patients were in the age group between 21-50 years and the ratio between male and female was 2.5:1. most (61.90%) of the cases were from the lower socio-economic group. out of 105 samples, 23 (37.12%) were positive by gram stain, 29 (27.62%) yielded growth in culture media and 37 (35.24%) were positive by pcr for streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common aetiological agent (19.05%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (13.33%), haemophilus influenzae (8.57%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.71%). multiplex pcr  is a useful technique for rapid diagnosis of bacterial causes of pneumonia directly from sputum and blood. considering culture as a gold standard, the sensitivity of pcr was 96.55% and specificity was 88.15%. more than 80% of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were found to be sensitive to ampicillin, amoxycillinclavulanate, and ceftriaxone. susceptibilities to other antimicrobials ranged from 65% for azithromycin to 70% for levofloxacin. on the other hand, the  gram negative organisms were more sensitive to meropenem, ceftriaxone, amoxycillin-clavulanate and amikacin.

TI  == functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == in this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (amps; pl-5, pl-31, pl-32, pl-18, pl-29 and pl-26), alone or in combination, against three gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus epidermidis)  and three gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. in addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and pl-5  against staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. traditional antibiotics and amps showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro. a strong synergistic effect in the pl-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. the mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of amps and traditional antibiotics. the combination of amps and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections,  particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.

TI  == [surveillance report of drug-resistant bacteria from 2007 to 2012 in saga prefecture, japan (the second report)].
AB  == drug-resistant bacteria are a problematic issue in japan. surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is important because the frequency of isolation and kinds of such bacteria vary between hospitals and local areas. this study summarizes the results of detection of drug-resistant bacteria in saga prefecture from july  2007 to june 2012. data presented in this study were collected through questionnaire survey that was conducted in 12 hospitals. frequency of drug-resistant bacteria are as follows: 62.5% of staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa); 62.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae was penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) or penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp); 26.4% of haemophilus influenzae was beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar); 0.5% of pseudomonas aeruginosa was metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) p. aeruginosa; 0.5% of p. aeruginosa was multi-drug  resistant p. aeruginosa (mdrp); 12.9% and 5.1% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing  organisms. while the isolation frequencies of mrsa and pisp/prsp were unchanged,  those of blnar, esbl producing e. coli and esbl producing k. pneumoniae raised from 15.4% to 34.2%, from 5.7% to 18.4% and from 2.6% to 8.2%, respectively, over the past 5 years. the frequencies of isolation of mdrp and two drug resistant p.  aeruginosa declined. this study revealed that the overall trend in the long-term  changes of isolation frequency of drug-resistant bacteria in saga prefecture is similar to the trend in the national data. it also showed that the frequency and  kinds of drug-resistant bacteria are variable between hospitals and local areas.  further study, such as examination of the usage and mic value of antimicrobial drugs, will enable us to gain more detailed information on the drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == platelet-rich plasma affects bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  == background aims: platelet-rich plasma (prp), a blood derivative rich in platelets, is a relatively new technique used in tissue regeneration and engineering. the increased quantity of platelets makes this formulation of considerable value for their role in tissue healing and microbicidal activity. this activity was investigated against five of the most important strains involved in nosocomial infections (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis) to understand the prophylactic role of pure (p)-prp. microbicidal proteins released  from activated p-prp platelets were also determined. methods: the microbicidal activity of p-prp and platelet-poor plasma (ppp) was evaluated on different concentrations of the five bacterial strains incubated for 1, 2, 4 and 18 h and plated on agar for 18-24 h. p-prp and ppp-released microbicidal proteins were evaluated by means of multiplex bead-based immunoassays. results: p-prp and ppp inhibited bacterial growth for up to 2 h of incubation. the effect of p-prp was significantly higher than that of ppp, mainly at the low seeding concentrations and/or shorter incubation times, depending on the bacterial strain. chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-3, chemokine (c-c motif) ligand-5 and chemokine (c-x-c motif)  ligand-1 were the molecules mostly related to pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis inhibition. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were less influenced. conclusions: the present results show that p-prp might supply an early protection against bacterial contaminations during surgical interventions because the inhibitory activity is already evident  from the first hour of treatment, which suggests that physiological molecules supplied in loco might be important in the time frame needed for the activation of the innate immune response.

AB  == we report a severe case of staphylococcus lugdunensis (s. lugdunensis) keratitis  presenting as suppurative keratitis in a 77-year-old woman. the patient's chief complaint was eye pain and decreased visual acuity in her right eye. suppurative  keratitis with a severe corneal abscess was diagnosed by a slit-lamp ophthalmic examination. the causative organism was identified as s. lugdunensis by bacterial culture, using a corneal abrasion specimen. she was treated with an intravenous drip infusion of ceftazidime and instillation of gentamicin sulfate ophthalmic solution (six times daily) and ofloxacin ophthalmic ointment (once daily before bedtime) as empiric therapy. her hospital course was complicated by a corneal perforation of her right eye. the antibiotic susceptibility for s. lugdunensis was sensitive, but with a slightly high mic for antibiotics used in empiric therapy. the therapeutic drug was changed to levofloxacin ophthalmic solution. the corneal abscess left a scar after healing. representative causative organisms of suppurative keratitis include pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae, but care must be taken in cases involving rare causative organisms. empiric therapy is necessary for rapidly progressing suppurative keratitis, but a detailed examination of the causative organism is important for therapeutic planning before empiric therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides are highly abundant and active in postoperative pleural drainage fluids.
AB  == background: the human lung is considered a nonsterile organ, and surgical interventions therefore take place in a more or less contaminated operating field. nevertheless, infectious complications of the pleural cavity are low after major lung resections. antimicrobial peptides (amps) are part of the innate immunity and display a broad capacity to kill pathogens. we hypothesized that the pleural space must have a high natural antimicrobial barrier and that amps might  effectively protect the pleural cavity. methods: pleural effusions were collected after lung operations. antimicrobial activity of the fluids against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was analyzed by microdilution assays. amps were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and immunohistochemical analysis. the impact of proinflammatory triggers on amp release from pleural mesothelial cells was evaluated. results: antimicrobial activity assays revealed high bactericidal properties of postoperative pleural drainage fluids. they effectively killed gram-negative pathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as gram-positive pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes). a variety of amps was detected at constantly high concentrations in the pleural fluids. they mainly derived from leukocytes and pleural epithelium. although proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in the postoperative pleural fluids, amp expression could not be augmented by toll-like receptor (tlr) triggering or by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)alpha. conclusions: we provide the first evidence of a high  abundance of amps in postoperative pleural fluids. our findings might explain the broad protection against infectious complications of the pleural space after major lung operations.

TI  == moxifloxacin modulates inflammation during murine pneumonia.
AB  == background: moxifloxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent belonging to the fluoroquinolone family. the antimicrobial activity of quinolones against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is based on their ability to inhibit topoisomerases. quinolones are described to have immunomodulatory features in addition to their antimicrobial activities. it was the goal of this study to examine whether a short term treatment with moxifloxacin modulates the inflammation during a subsequently induced bacterial infection in an animal model. methods: mice were treated with moxifloxacin or saline for two consecutive days and were subsequently intranasally infected with viable or heat-inactivated  bacterial pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) for 6 and  24 hours. measurements of cytokines in the lungs and plasma were performed. alveolar cells were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluits. results: the inflammation was increased after the inoculation of viable bacteria compared to inactivated bacteria. numbers of total immune cells and neutrophils and concentrations of inflammatory mediators (e.g. kc, il-1beta, il-17a) were significantly reduced in lungs of moxifloxacin-treated mice infected with inactivated and viable bacterial pathogens as compared to infected control mice.  plasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators were significantly reduced in moxifloxacin-treated mice. immunohistochemistry showed a stronger infiltrate of tnf-alpha-expressing cells into lungs of saline-treated mice infected with viable p. aeruginosa as compared to moxifloxacin-treated mice. conclusions: these data show that in this pneumonia model moxifloxacin has anti-inflammatory properties beyond its antibacterial activity.

TI  == epidemiology and predictors of multidrug-resistant community-acquired and health  care-associated pneumonia.
AB  == there are limited u.s. data describing the risk factors for multidrug-resistant organism (mdro) isolation in community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and health care-associated pneumonia (hcap). however, concern for the presence of these pathogens drives the prescribing of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for cap and hcap. a retrospective study of all adults hospitalized with community-onset pneumonia (cap and hcap) at a large u.s. medical center from january 2010 to december 2011 was conducted. the objective was to ascertain the rate of pneumonia caused by mdros and to evaluate whether hcap is a risk factor for mdro pneumonia. univariate and propensity score-adjusted multivariate analyses were performed. a  total of 521 patients (50.5% cap and 49.5% hcap) were included. the most common etiologies of pneumonia were primary viral and streptococcus pneumoniae. mdros were isolated in 20 (3.8%) patients overall, and mdros occurred in 5.9% and 1.9%  of hcap and cap patients, respectively. the presence of an mdro was not associated with hcap classification (odds ratio [or]=1.95; 95% confidence interval [95% ci], 0.66 to 5.80; p=0.23) or with most of its individual components (hemodialysis, home infusion, home wound care, and >/=48-h hospitalization in the last 90 days). independent predictors of mdro included the following: pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization/infection in the previous year (or=7.43; 95% ci, 2.24 to 24.61; p<0.001), antimicrobial use in the previous 90 days (or=2.90; 95% ci, 1.13 to 7.45; p=0.027), admission from a nursing home (or=4.19; 95% ci, 1.55 to 11.31; p=0.005), and duration of hospitalization in the previous 90 or 180 days (p=0.013 and p=0.002, respectively). mdros were uncommon  in hcap and cap. hcap did not predict mdro isolation. local etiology of community onset pneumonia and specific mdro risk factors should be integrated into therapeutic decisions to prevent empirical overprescribing of antibiotics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == structural and kinetic bases for the metal preference of the m18 aminopeptidase from pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the peptidases in clan mh are known as cocatalytic zinc peptidases that have two  zinc ions in the active site, but their metal preference has not been rigorously  investigated. in this study, the molecular basis for metal preference is provided from the structural and biochemical analyses. kinetic studies of pseudomonas aeruginosa aspartyl aminopeptidase (paap) which belongs to peptidase family m18 in clan mh revealed that its peptidase activity is dependent on co(2+) rather than zn(2+): the kcat (s(-1)) values of paap were 0.006, 5.10 and 0.43 in no-metal, co(2+), and zn(2+)conditions, respectively. consistently, addition of low concentrations of co(2+) to paap previously saturated with zn(2+) greatly enhanced the enzymatic activity, suggesting that co(2+)may be the physiologically relevant cocatalytic metal ion of paap. the crystal structures of paap complexes  with co(2+) or zn(2+) commonly showed two metal ions in the active site coordinated with three conserved residues and a bicarbonate ion in a tetragonal geometry. however, co(2+)- and zn(2+)-bound structures showed no noticeable alterations relevant to differential effects of metal species, except the relative orientation of glu-265, a general base in the active site. the characterization of mutant paap revealed that the first metal binding site is primarily responsible for metal preference. similar to paap, streptococcus pneumonia glutamyl aminopeptidase (spgp), belonging to aminopeptidase family m42  in clan mh, also showed requirement for co(2+) for maximum activity. these results proposed that clan mh peptidases might be a cocatalytic cobalt peptidase  rather than a zinc-dependent peptidase.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == the influence of stents on microbial colonization of the airway in children after slide tracheoplasty: a 14-year single-center experience.
AB  == objectives: this study describes the microbial colonization profile of the airway in children after slide tracheoplasty (stp) with and without stents, and compares colonization to children undergoing cardiothoracic surgical procedures without airway related disease. methods: a 14-year retrospective single case note review  was performed on patients undergoing stp and stent insertion. nose and throat (nt) and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) specimens were analyzed for microbial profile and expressed as cumulative mean microorganisms per patient (mmp). results: forty-three patients (median age +/- sd 15.02 +/- 31.76 months) underwent stp and 141 patients underwent cardiothoracic but no airway surgery (median age +/- sd 31.7 +/- 47.2 months). sixteen patients required a stent after stp. one-hundred seventy-two positive microbial specimens were identified. the predominant 6 microorganisms were (1) staphylococcus aureus; (2) pseudomonas aeruginosa; (3) haemophilus influenzae not type b; (4) coliforms; (5) streptococcus pneumoniae; and (6) candida albicans, and accounted for 128 (74%) of all positive specimens found. children with stents had more mmp compared to children without stents after stp [4.06 +/- 2.38 and 2.04 +/- 2.24 mmp (p < 0.001), respectively]. both groups of children after stp had more mmp compared to the control group (p < 0.001). children with stents had more microbial colonization of their lower respiratory tract compared to their upper respiratory tract (3.36 +/- 2.02 and 1.36 +/- 0.93 mmp (p < 0.01) respectively). staphylococcus aureus colonization of the lower respiratory tract was significantly higher in children with stents compared to children without stents  after stp [0.5 and 0.15 mmp (p < 0.05) respectively]. conclusions: this study indicates airway surgery and the subsequent use of stents to be a significant risk factor for microbial colonization of the airway in children. more specifically airway stents appear to increase colonization in the distal airway,  which appears unrelated to that of the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == impact of staphylococcus aureus on pathogenesis in polymicrobial infections.
AB  == polymicrobial infections involving staphylococcus aureus exhibit enhanced disease severity and morbidity. we reviewed the nature of polymicrobial interactions between s. aureus and other bacterial, fungal, and viral cocolonizers. microbes that were frequently recovered from the infection site with s. aureus are haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, corynebacterium sp., lactobacillus sp., candida albicans, and influenza virus. detailed analyses of several in vitro and in vivo  observations demonstrate that s. aureus exhibits cooperative relations with c. albicans, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, and influenza virus and competitive relations with p. aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sp., and corynebacterium sp. interactions of both types influence changes in s. aureus that alter its characteristics in terms of colony formation, protein expression,  pathogenicity, and antibiotic susceptibility.

TI  == epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and clinical outcomes of healthcare-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients: a spanish cohort study.
AB  == purpose: information about healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap) in critically ill patients is scarce. methods: this prospective study compared clinical presentation, outcomes, microbial etiology, and treatment of hcap, community-acquired pneumonia (cap), and immunocompromised patients (icp) with severe pneumonia admitted to 34 spanish icus. results: a total of 726 patients with pneumonia (449 cap, 133 hcap, and 144 icp) were recruited during 1 year from april 2011. hcap patients had more comorbidities and worse clinical status (barthel score). hcap and icp patients needed mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy more frequently than cap patients. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all three groups (cap, 34.2 %; hcap, 19.5 %; icp, 23.4  %; p = 0.001). the overall incidence of gram-negative pathogens, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and pseudomonas aeruginosa was low, but higher in hcap and icp patients than cap. empirical treatment was in line with cap guidelines in 73.5 % of patients with cap, in 45.5 % of those with  hcap, and in 40 % of those with icp. the incidence of inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was 6.5 % in cap, 14.4 % in hcap, and 21.8 % in icp (p < 0.001). mortality was highest in icp (38.6 %) and did not differ between cap (18.4 %) and hcap (21.2 %). conclusions: hcap accounts for one-fifth of cases of  severe pneumonia in patients admitted to spanish icus. the empirical antibiotic therapy recommended for cap would be appropriate for 90 % of patients with hcap in our population, and consequently the decision to include coverage of multidrug-resistant pathogens for hcap should be cautiously judged in order to prevent the overuse of antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro interaction of pseudomonas aeruginosa with human middle ear epithelial cells.
AB  == background: otitis media (om) is an inflammation of the middle ear which can be acute or chronic. acute om is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of chronic suppurative otitis media (csom). csom is a chronic inflammatory  disorder of the middle ear characterized by infection and discharge. the survivors often suffer from hearing loss and neurological sequelae. however, no information is available regarding the interaction of p. aeruginosa with human middle ear epithelial cells (hmeecs). methodology and findings: in the present investigation, we demonstrate that p. aeruginosa is able to enter and survive inside hmeecs via an uptake mechanism that is dependent on microtubule and actin  microfilaments. the actin microfilament disrupting agent as well as microtubule inhibitors exhibited significant decrease in invasion of hmeecs by p. aeruginosa. confocal microscopy demonstrated f-actin condensation associated with bacterial entry. this recruitment of f-actin was transient and returned to normal distribution after bacterial internalization. scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of bacteria on the surface of hmeecs, and transmission  electron microscopy confirmed the internalization of p. aeruginosa located in the plasma membrane-bound vacuoles. we observed a significant decrease in cell invasion of oprf mutant compared to the wild-type strain. p. aeruginosa induced cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by the determination of lactate dehydrogenase levels in culture supernatants of infected hmeecs and by a fluorescent dye-based  assay. interestingly, oprf mutant showed little cell damage compared to wild-type p. aeruginosa. conclusions and significance: this study deciphered the key events in the interaction of p. aeruginosa with hmeecs in vitro and highlighted the role of bacterial outer membrane protein, oprf, in this process. understanding the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of csom will help in identifying novel targets to design effective therapeutic strategies and to prevent hearing loss.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. the purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (ca-bsis) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible ca-bsis and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with ca-bsis. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of manhattan in new york, ny, from 2006 to 2008. the ca-bsis present at hospital admission were defined as bsis occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. results: in total, 1677 ca-bsis were identified. staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (or, 2.55; 95% ci, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for s. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations  (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for s. pneumoniae (p=0.02). urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). conclusion: over 27% of the ca-bsis present on admission were antibiotic resistant. understanding the prevalence and risk factors for ca-bsis may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.

TI  == black cobra (naja naja karachiensis) lysates exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities.
AB  == it is hypothesized that animals living in polluted environments possess antimicrobials to counter pathogenic microbes. the fact that snakes feed on germ-infested rodents suggests that they encounter pathogenic microbes and likely possess antimicrobials. the venom is used only to paralyze the rodent, but the ability of snakes to counter potential infections in the gut due to disease-ridden rodents requires robust action of the immune system against a broad range of pathogens. to test this hypothesis, crude lysates of different organs of naja naja karachiensis (black cobra) were tested for antimicrobial properties. the antimicrobial activities of extracts were tested against selected bacterial pathogens (neuropathogenic escherichia coli k1, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumonia), protist (acanthamoeba castellanii), and filamentous fungus (fusarium  solani). the findings revealed that plasma and various organ extracts of n. n. karachiensis exhibited antimicrobial activity against e. coli k1, mrsa, p. aeruginosa, s. pneumoniae, a. castellanii, and f. solani in a concentration-dependent manner. the results of this study are promising for the development of new antimicrobials.

TI  == antibacterial properties of the cftr potentiator ivacaftor.
AB  == background: ivacaftor increases cftr channel activity and improves pulmonary function for individuals bearing a g551d mutation. because ivacaftor structurally resembles quinolone antibiotics, we tested the hypothesis that ivacaftor possesses antibacterial properties. methods: bioluminescence, colony forming unit, and minimal inhibitory concentration assays were used to assess viability of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and multiple clinical microbial  isolates. results: ivacaftor induced a dose-dependent reduction in bioluminescence of s. aureus and decreased the number of colony forming units. we observed a similar but less robust effect in p. aeruginosa following outer membrane permeabilization. ivacaftor inhibited the growth of respiratory isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae and exhibited positive interactions with antibiotics against lab and respiratory strains of s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. conclusion: these data indicate that ivacaftor exhibits antibacterial properties and raise the intriguing possibility that ivacaftor might have an antibiotic effect in people with cf.

TI  == the impact of respiratory tract infections on the nutritional state of children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) is a life-shortening, autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by intestinal malabsorption, impaired growth and lung disease. recurrent pulmonary infections in children with cf are often associated with nutritional deficiencies. aim: to emphasize the effects of recurrent pulmonary infections on nutritional status in children with cf. material and methods: this  retrospective study included 27 patients diagnosed with cf between 1994 and 2011  in the 3rd pediatric clinic of the iasi "saint mary" children's hospital. the nutritional status was assessed according to ponderal index (pi), body mass index (bmi), z score for weight and waist. correlations between the age of onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis, and frequency of infectious episodes, identified bacterial agents and nutritional status were established. results: patients aged  between 3 months old and 17 years old with an average of 49.48 months +/- 9.83ds; sex ratio was 1.7:1. the patients were diagnosed late, one month to 112 months (average 41.11 months +/- 9.4ds) from the first symptoms until the moment of diagnosis. the clinical forms of cf in the study group were: predominantly respiratory manifestations in 48.14% of cases, and the mixed type, with both respiratory and digestive symptoms, in 18.52% of cases. delayed weight and/or height gains were identified in 85.19% of cases. the etiologic agents involved in pulmonary infections were staphylococus aureus (48.14%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.33%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18.51%), haemophilus influenzae (14.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (11.10%), moraxella catarrhalis (7,40%), streptococcus pneutmoniae (7.40%), neisseria sica (7.40%). pulmonary infections caused by staphylococus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were more often associated with nutritional status abnormalities. conclusions: in small children with cf pulmonary infections due to various causative agents cause a slow rate of growth (both weight and height). good nutrition and adequate early treatment of pulmonary infections are beneficial for the general state of affected children and are very important in maintaining their health.

TI  == new cationic antimicrobial peptide screened from boiled-dried anchovies by immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography.
AB  == an efficient immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography method was used to screen potential antimicrobial peptides from boiled-dried anchovies. a novel cationic antimicrobial peptide (apep10) was successfully isolated by one-step chromatography. the sequence of apep10 was identified as glarclagtl by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (maldi-q-tof ms). the antimicrobial activity assessment indicated that apep10 inhibited the growth of the reference bacteria (escherichia coli, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae), with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging from 8 to 64 mug/ml. almost no cytotoxicity against mouse erythrocytes was observed at concentrations below 20 mug/ml. nucleotide leakage induced by apep10 showed that the peptide exhibited permeable activity on the cytoplasmic membrane. alterations in morphology were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (sem). membrane disruption was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with propidium iodide (pi). the results demonstrate that immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography is a straightforward technique for screening unknown antimicrobial peptides with cell-membrane-interacting activities from boiled-dried anchovies.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == bacterial colonization increases daily symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == rationale: respiratory pathogens are frequently isolated from the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) in the absence of an exacerbation. this bacterial "colonization" by potential pathogens is associated  with host inflammatory and immune responses, which could increase respiratory symptoms. objectives: to study whether bacterial colonization impacts daily respiratory symptoms in copd. methods: in a longitudinal prospective observational study of copd, patients recorded daily symptoms electronically on the breathlessness, cough, and sputum scale (bcss). sputum cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were performed every 2 weeks. the relationship of bcss and bacterial colonization was analyzed with generalized linear mixed effects models, after controlling for exacerbations, weather conditions, lung function, and demographic variables. measurements and main results: a total of 41 patients recorded daily symptoms for 12,527 days. the average bcss score was higher during the periods of colonization, determined by sputum culture with one or more of the following pathogens: nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to periods without colonization (5.28 vs. 4.46;  p = 0.008) after controlling for confounding variables. the finding did not change when colonization was defined by quantitative pcr (average bcss, 4.77 vs.  4.25; p = 0.006). sputum il-8 levels were elevated with bacterial colonization. conclusions: even in the absence of clinical exacerbation, colonization by bacterial pathogens in copd was associated with a clinically significant moderate increase in daily symptoms, likely mediated by increased airway inflammation. novel therapies that decrease bacterial colonization in copd could improve daily  symptoms and quality of life.

TI  == hira-tan: a real-time pcr-based system for the rapid identification of causative  agents in pneumonia.
AB  == identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. to identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. here, we devised a pcr-based test, named hira-tan, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g.  streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. mycoplasma pneumoniae or legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. the utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the hira-tan assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for h. influenzae; 93.2% for pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for escherichia coli; 78.1% for mrsa and 91.6% for s. pneumoniae. overall the hira-tan procedure was able to identify the  causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. the hira-tan approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the hira-tan will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias. clinical trials registration: umin000001694.

TI  == vaccines for children and adults with chronic lung disease: efficacy against acute exacerbations.
AB  == acute exacerbations of chronic lung disease are usually associated with viral and bacterial pathogens. they contribute to declining lung function, poor quality of  life and exert an excess burden on individuals, families, communities and the healthcare sector. hence, preventing exacerbations is important in clinical management. several vaccines providing protection against respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, bordetella pertussis and influenza) that can trigger exacerbations are available, but evidence to support their effectiveness in preventing exacerbations of chronic lung disease is limited. candidate vaccines in pre-clinical or clinical development phases include those targeting haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses. however, it is likely to be several years before vaccines against these pathogens are available  for children and adults with chronic lung diseases. for vaccination to play an important role in managing chronic lung disease efforts need to be directed at understanding how various pathogens cause exacerbations and alter long-term lung  function.

TI  == microbiology of the middle meatus compared to sputum in young patients with cystic fibrosis from bahia - brazil.
AB  == lower airway infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. it is currently unknown if the infection of the upper airway can cause exacerbation of lower respiratory tract infection. this study aimed to determine the microbiological profile of the anterior paranasal sinuses  outflow tract (middle meatus) of cystic fibrosis outpatients. the microbiological profile was defined using endoscopically directed middle meatal cultures. paired  middle meatal and sputum specimens were collected from 56 outpatients for aerobic cultures. a semi-quantitative leukocyte count of the middle meatal samples was performed. the median age of patients was nine years (3-20 years). staphylococcus aureus (37%), staphylococcus coagulase-negative (25%), neisseriac (14%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7%) were the most prevalent microorganisms in the middle meatal cultures. using the middle meatal leukocyte count, 16 out of 54 patients (29.6%) presented sinus infection. the most frequently identified pathogens in patients with sinus infections were staphylococcus aureus (10 patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 patients), and streptococcus pneumoniae (3 patients). agreement of paired middle meatal and sputum cultures was significantly higher among patients with infection in middle  meatal (69%). the most common middle meatal pathogens were the typical cystic fibrosis spectrum. this suggests the potential for participating in post-nasal lower airway seeding.

TI  == a worldwide perspective of nursing home-acquired pneumonia compared with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == background: nursing home-acquired pneumonia (nhap) is the leading cause of death  among long-term care patients and the second most common cause of transfers to acute care facilities. the aim of this study was to characterize the incidence, microbiology, and outcomes for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and nhap. methods: a secondary analysis of 5,160 patients from the community-acquired pneumonia organization database was performed. world regions were defined as the united states and canada (i), latin america (ii), and europe (iii). results: from a total of 5,160 hospitalized patients with cap, nhap was identified in 287 (5.6%) patients. mean age was 80 y. nhap distribution by region was 6% in region i, 3% in region ii, and 7% in region iii. subjects with nhap had higher frequencies of neurological disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and renal failure than did subjects with cap (p < .001). icu admission was required in 32 (12%) subjects. etiology was defined in 68 (23%) subjects with nhap and 1,300 (27%) with cap. the most common pathogens identified in nhap included streptococcus pneumoniae (31%), staphylococcus species (31%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). presentation of nhap more frequently included pleural effusions (34% vs 21%, p < .001) and multilobar involvement (31% vs 24%, p < .001). thirty-day hospital mortality was statistically greater among subjects with nhap than among those with cap (42% vs  18%, p < .001). conclusions: worldwide, only a very small proportion of hospitalized patients with cap present with nhap; the poor outcomes for these patients may be due primarily to a higher number of comorbidities compared with patients without nhap.

TI  == respiratory viruses are associated with common respiratory pathogens in cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: test the hypothesis that the link between respiratory viruses and pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis (cf) reflects increased frequency or severity of lower airways infection. study design: molecular respiratory viral panels (rvps), cell counts, and quantitative bacterial cultures were assessed in  235 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) samples from 138 children with cf. relationships among the data were analyzed using multivariate methods. results: rvps were positive in 67 (28.5%) balf samples from 52 (37.7%) patients, with rhinovirus/enterovirus most common (82.4% of rvp+). rvp+ patients were younger (5.4 years, iqr 3.0-9.7 vs. 8.0 years, iqr 3.5-12.9; p < 0.01), more likely to have respiratory symptoms (74.6% vs. 55.2%, p < 0.01), and had higher balf percent neutrophils (70.5%, iqr 46-85% vs. 59.3%, iqr 34-77%; p < 0.05). percent  predicted fev1 at bronchoscopy was diminished from baseline in both groups, but recovered in the rvp- (90.2 +/- 22.2% vs. 89.6 +/- 19.7%, p = 0.62) but not the rvp+ subjects (95.7 +/- 21.1% vs. 89.1 +/- 18.0%, p < 0.05). rvp status did not alter recovery rates of typical cf respiratory pathogens including staphylococcus aureus (44.8% vs. 42.9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.4% vs. 25.6%). however, common respiratory pathogens (haemophilus species, moraxella species, and streptococcus pneumoniae) were recovered more frequently from rvp+ samples independent of age (or 3.6, 95% ci 1.8-7.5, p < 0.001). conclusions: respiratory  viruses were frequently detected in balf from cf patients and associated with markers of disease severity. respiratory viruses did not impact frequency or severity of infection with typical cf pathogens, but rates of infection with common respiratory pathogens were increased. this finding may have treatment implications.

TI  == microbial aetiology of healthcare associated pneumonia in spain: a prospective, multicentre, case-control study.
AB  == introduction: healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap) is actually considered a subgroup of hospital-acquired pneumonia due to the reported high risk of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the usa. therefore, current american thoracic society/infectious diseases society of america guidelines suggest a nosocomial antibiotic treatment for hcap. unfortunately, the scientific evidence supporting  this is contradictory. methods: we conducted a prospective multicentre case-control study in spain, comparing clinical presentation, outcomes and microbial aetiology of hcap and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) patients matched by age (+/-10 years), gender and period of admission (+/-10 weeks). results: 476 patients (238 cases, 238 controls) were recruited for 2 years from june 2008. hcap cases showed significantly more comorbidities (including dysphagia), higher frequency of previous antibiotic use in the preceding month, higher pneumonia severity score and worse clinical status (charslon and barthel scores). while microbial aetiology did not differ between the two groups (hcap and cap: streptococcus pneumoniae: 51% vs 55%; viruses: 22% vs 12%; legionella: 4% vs 9%; gram-negative bacilli: 5% vs 4%; pseudomonas aeruginosa: 4% vs 1%), hcap patients showed worse mortality rates (1-month: hcap, 12%; cap 5%; 1-year: hcap, 24%; cap, 9%), length of hospital stay (9 vs 7 days), 1-month treatment failure (5.5% vs 1.5%) and readmission rate (18% vs 11%) (p<0.05, each). conclusions: despite a similar clinical presentation, hcap was more severe due to patients' conditions (comorbidities) and showed worse clinical outcomes. microbial aetiology of hcap did not differ from cap indicating that it is not related to increased mortality and in spain most hcap patients do not need nosocomial antibiotic coverage.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == host response to respiratory bacterial pathogens as identified by integrated analysis of human gene expression data.
AB  == respiratory bacterial pathogens are one of the leading causes of infectious death in the world and a major health concern complicated by the rise of multi-antibiotic resistant strains. therapeutics that modulate host genes essential for pathogen infectivity could potentially avoid multi-drug resistance  and provide a wider scope of treatment options. here, we perform an integrative analysis of published human gene expression data generated under challenges from  the gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria pathogens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. we applied a previously described differential gene and pathway enrichment analysis pipeline to publicly available  host mrna geo datasets resulting from exposure to bacterial infection. we found 72 canonical human pathways common between four geo datasets, representing p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae. although the majority of these pathways are known to be involved with immune response, we found several interesting new interactions such as the sumo1 pathway that might have a role in bacterial infections. furthermore, 36 host-bacterial pathways were also shared with our previous results for respiratory virus host gene expression. based on our pathway analysis we propose several drug-repurposing opportunities supported by the literature.

TI  == acute lower respiratory infections on lung sequelae in cambodia, a neglected disease in highly tuberculosis-endemic country.
AB  == background: little is known about post-infectious pulmonary sequelae in countries like cambodia where tuberculosis is hyper-endemic and childhood pulmonary infections are highly frequent. we describe the characteristics of hospitalized cambodian patients presenting with community-acquired acute lower respiratory infections (alri) on post-infectious pulmonary sequelae (alrips). methods: between 2007 and 2010, inpatients >/=15 years with alri were prospectively recruited. clinical, biological, radiological and microbiological data were collected. chest radiographs were re-interpreted by experts to compare patients with alrips, on previously healthy lungs (alrihl) and active pulmonary tuberculosis (tb). patients without chest radiograph abnormality or with abnormality suggestive as other chronic respiratory diseases were excluded from this analysis. results: among the 2351 inpatients with community-acquired alri, 1800 were eligible: 426 (18%) alrips, 878 (37%) alrihl and 496 (21%) tb. alrips patients had less frequent fever than other alri (p < 0.001) and more productive  cough than alrihl (p < 0.001). streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae,  and pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 83% of alrips group positive cultures. h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa were significantly associated with alrips compared with alrihl. treatment was appropriate in 58% of alrips patients. finally, 79% of alrips were not recognized by local clinicians. in-hospital mortality was low (1%) but probably underestimated in the alrips group. conclusion: alrips remains often misdiagnosed as tb with inappropriate treatment  in low-income countries. better-targeted training programs would help reduce the  morbidity burden and financial costs.

TI  == haemolytic uraemic syndrome associated with pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis.
AB  == haemolytic uraemic syndrome (hus) is a recognized complication of infection with  shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) and shigella dysenteriae type 1. infections with other micro-organisms, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, have  been cited as causes of hus. in addition, influenza virus and other viruses may rarely be associated with this syndrome. a 2-year-old girl presented with severe  pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis with renal failure and ecthyma gangrenosum. further investigations revealed features of hus. she was managed with antibiotics and other supportive measures including peritoneal dialysis, and subsequently made a  full recovery. a possible role of neuraminidase in the pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa-associated hus was proposed. this is the first reported case of p. aeruginosa sepsis leading to hus.

TI  == assessment of the interplay between blood and skin vascular abnormalities in adult purpura fulminans.
AB  == rationale: purpura fulminans in adults is a rare but devastating disease. its pathophysiology is not well known. objectives: to understand the pathophysiology  of skin lesions in purpura fulminans, the interplay between circulating blood and vascular alterations was assessed. methods: prospective multicenter study in four intensive care units. patients with severe sepsis without skin lesions were recruited as control subjects. measurements and main results: twenty patients with severe sepsis and purpura fulminans were recruited for blood sampling, and skin biopsy was performed in deceased patients. high severity of disease and mortality rates (80%) was observed. skin biopsies in purpura fulminans lesions revealed thrombosis and extensive vascular damage: vascular congestion and dilation, endothelial necrosis, alteration of markers of endothelial integrity (cd31) and of the protein c pathway receptors (endothelial protein c receptor, thrombomodulin). elevated plasminogen activating inhibitor-1 mrna was also observed. comparison with control patients showed that these lesions were specific to purpura fulminans. by contrast, no difference was observed for blood  hemostasis parameters, including soluble thrombomodulin, activated protein c, and disseminated intravascular coagulation markers. bacterial presence at the vascular wall was observed specifically in areas of vascular damage in eight of nine patients tested (including patients with streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa infection). conclusions: thrombi and extensive vascular damage with multifaceted prothrombotic local imbalance are characteristics of purpura fulminans. a "vascular wall infection" hypothesis, responsible for endothelial damage and subsequent skin lesions, can be put forward.

TI  == direction of aminoacylated transfer rnas into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  == prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer rnas often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. many clinically relevant bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-trna species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. in streptomycetes, aminoacylated-trna species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. the direction of coding aminoacylated-trna molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.

TI  == determination of the biofilm formation capacity of bacterial pathogens associated with otorhinolaryngologic diseases in the malaysian population.
AB  == this study aims to assess the association between microbial composition, biofilm  formation and chronic otorhinolaryngologic disorders in malaysia. a total of 45 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic tonsillitis and chronic suppurative otitis media and 15 asymptomatic control patients were studied. swab samples were obtained from these subjects. samples were studied by conventional microbiological culturing, pcr-based microbial detection and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) and other streptococcus species were detected in subjects of both patient and control groups. biofilm was observed in approximately half of the smear prepared from swab samples obtained from subjects of the patient group. most of these were polymicrobial biofilms. s. aureus biofilm was most prevalent among nasal samples  while h. influenzae biofilm was more common among ear and throat samples. results from this study supported the hypothesis that chronic otorhinolaryngologic diseases may be biofilm related. due to the presence of unculturable bacteria in  biofilms present in specimens from ear, nose and throat, the use of molecular methods in combination with conventional microbiological culturing has demonstrated an improvement in the detection of bacteria from such specimens in this study.

TI  == impact of swimming on chronic suppurative otitis media in aboriginal children: a  randomised controlled trial.
AB  == objectives: to measure the impact of 4 weeks of daily swimming on rates of ear discharge among aboriginal children with a tympanic membrane perforation (tmp) and on the microbiology of the nasopharynx and middle ear. design, setting and participants: a randomised controlled trial involving 89 aboriginal children (aged 5-12 2013s) with a tmp, conducted in two remote northern territory aboriginal communities from august to december 2009. intervention: 4 school weeks of daily swimming lessons (45 minutes) in a chlorinated pool. main outcome measures: proportions of children with ear discharge and respiratory and opportunistic bacteria in the nasopharynx and middle ear. results: of 89 children randomly assigned to the swimming or non-swimming groups, 58 (26/41 swimmers and  32/48 non-swimmers) had ear discharge at baseline. after 4 weeks, 24 of 41 swimmers had ear discharge compared with 32 of 48 non-swimmers (risk difference,  - 8% (95% ci, - 28% to 12%). there were no statistically significant changes in the microbiology of the nasopharynx or middle ear in swimmers or non-swimmers. streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable haemophilus influenzae were the dominant organisms cultured from the nasopharynx, and h. influenzae, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the dominant organisms in the middle ear. conclusions: swimming lessons for aboriginal children in remote communities should be supported, but it is unlikely that they will substantially  reduce rates of chronic suppurative otitis media and associated bacteria in the nasopharynx and middle ear. however, swimming was not associated with increased risk of ear discharge and we found no reason to discourage it. trial registration: australian new zealand clinical trials registry actrn12613000634774.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (zinforo, teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant gram-positive organisms, including mrsa, as well as for gram-negative respiratory pathogens. in pivotal phase iii studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csstis) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) [pneumonia outcomes research team (port) risk  class iii or iv]; however, patients with cap admitted to the intensive care unit  were not evaluated. ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with csstis (including those with suspected mrsa infection) or cap (port risk class iii or iv) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. as with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good  antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam combinations against esbl pathogens in respiratory and urinary infections.
AB  == background: the emergence and subsequent widespread dissemination of bacterial resistance to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics by the elaboration of esbl (extended spectrum beta lactamase) poses a serious threat to the effective use of beta lactam antibiotics and cephalosporins. cefoperazone combination with the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam would be a strong basis for rational therapeutics when dealing with esbl producing pathogen mediated infections. objective: the objective of the study was to investigate the in vitro efficacy of cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam against esbl producing respiratory and urinary pathogens. methodology: 54 samples (34 samples of urine and 20 samples of sputum) were collected from 9 hospitals in mumbai. the pathogens isolated from urine included e. coli (n = 27), k. pneumoniae (n = 6), and serratia marcescens (n = 1). the pathogens isolated from sputum included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 14). the kirby bauer disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the susceptibility of the isolated pathogens to cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam. results: in sputum samples, all the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were susceptible to cefoperazone-tazobactam while one isolate was resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam. streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella pneumoniae were sensitive to both the antibiotic formulations. in uropathogens, higher susceptibility rates to cefoperazone-tazobactam (96% vs. 89%) were observed for escherichia coli. similarly higher rates of susceptibility to cefoperazone-tazobactam were observed for klebsiella as compared to cefoperazone-sulbactam (83% vs. 67%). serratia marcescens was sensitive to cefoperazone-tazobactam but was intermediate resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam. the isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae that were resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam were susceptible to cefoperazone-tazobactam. conclusion: the results of the current in vitro study corroborate the efficacy of the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam in improving the spectrum of activity and efficacy of cefoperazone.

TI  == infections of the respiratory system in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.
AB  == ataxia-telangiectasia (a-t) is an autosomal recessive multiorgan disease characterized by progressive neurologic deterioration in which the most common causes of death are diseases of the respiratory system and cancer. this retrospective case-series characterizes the pulmonary disease seen in 101 cancer-free a-t patients who were living with chronic respiratory symptoms or who had pulmonary disease listed as the cause of their death. all of the 101 patients developed chronic progressive pulmonary disease with intermittent acute exacerbations and irreversible radiographic changes. seventy-nine patients had microbiologic analysis of their respiratory secretions and of the patients less than 15 years of age, 25/27 cultured staphylococcus aureus, hemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus pneumoniae and 35/47 older patients cultured pseudomonas aeruginosa. opportunistic infections of the lungs were not observed.  thirty-two patients had histologic examination of their lungs and 21 of the specimens had both acute and chronic inflammatory changes. the results of this study describe the natural history of the suppurative lung disease in patients with a-t that often progresses to bronchiectasis and pneumonias and ultimately respiratory failure. the etiology of the progressive deterioration is unknown but the pulmonary disease of a-t described in this study shows similarities to the lung disease seen in cystic fibrosis. treatment of the lung disease in patients with a-t may benefit from many of the same therapies that have improved the quality of life for patients with cystic fibrosis.

AB  == p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae are major bacterial causes of corneal ulcers in industrialized and in developing countries. the current study examined host innate immune responses at the site of infection, and also expression of bacterial virulence factors in clinical isolates from patients in south india. corneal ulcer material was obtained from 49 patients with confirmed p. aeruginosa and 27 patients with s. pneumoniae, and gene expression of toll like receptors (tlr), cytokines and inflammasome proteins was measured by quantitative pcr. expression of p. aeruginosa type iii secretion exotoxins and s. pneumoniae pneumolysin was detected by western blot analysis. we found that neutrophils comprised >90% cells in corneal ulcers, and that there was elevated expression of tlr2, tlr4, tlr5 and tlr9, the nlrp3 and nlrc4 inflammasomes and the asc adaptor  molecule. il-1alpha il-1beta and ifn-gamma expression was also elevated; however, there was no significant difference in expression of any of these genes between corneal ulcers from p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae infected patients. we also show that 41/49 (84%) of p. aeruginosa clinical isolates expressed exos and exot, whereas 5/49 (10%) of isolates expressed exos, exot and exou with only 2/49 isolates expressing exot and exou. in contrast, all 27 s. pneumoniae clinical isolates produced pneumolysin. taken together, these findings demonstrate that exos/t expressing p. aeruginosa and pneumolysin expressing s. pneumoniae predominate in bacterial keratitis. while p. aeruginosa strains expressing both exou and exos are usually rare, these strains actually outnumbered strains expressing only exou in the current study. further, as neutrophils are the predominant cell type in these corneal ulcers, they are the likely source of cytokines and of the increased tlr and inflammasome expression.

TI  == molecular analysis of changes in pseudomonas aeruginosa load during treatment of  a pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis.
AB  == background: intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations (pes) of cystic fibrosis (cf) usually target pseudomonas aeruginosa. insights into the cf lung microbiome have questioned this approach. we used rt-qpcr to determine whether intravenous antibiotics reduced p. aeruginosa numbers and whether this correlated with improved lung function. we also investigated antibiotic effects on other common respiratory pathogens in cf. methods: sputa were collected from patients when stable and again during a pe. sputa were expectorated into a rna preservation buffer for rna extraction and preparation of cdna. qpcr was used to  enumerate viable p. aeruginosa as well as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, burkholderia cepacia complex and aspergillus fumigatus. results: fifteen cf patients were followed through 21 pes. a complete  set of serial sputum samples was unavailable for two patients (three separate pes). p. aeruginosa numbers did not increase immediately prior to a pe, but numbers during intravenous antibiotic treatment were reduced >/=4-log in 6/18 and >/=1-log in 4/18 pes. in 7/18 pes, p. aeruginosa numbers changed very little with intravenous antibiotics and one patient demonstrated a >/=2-log increase in p. aeruginosa load. h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were detected in ten and five pes respectively, but with antibiotic treatment these bacteria rapidly became undetectable in 6/10 and 4/5 pes, respectively. there was a negative correlation  between p. aeruginosa numbers and fev1 during stable phase (r(s)=0.75, p<0.05), and reductions in p. aeruginosa load with intravenous antibiotic treatment correlated with improved fev1 (r(s)=0.52, p<0.05). conclusions: exacerbations are not due to increased p. aeruginosa numbers in cf adults. however, lung function improvements correlate with reduced p. aeruginosa burden suggesting that current  antibiotic treatment strategies remain appropriate in most patients. improved understanding of pe characterised by unchanged p. aeruginosa numbers and minimal  lung function improvement following treatment may allow better targeted therapies.

AB  == importance: if not adequately cleaned, rigid nasal endoscopes (rnes) have the potential to cause iatrogenic cross-contamination. objective: to test the efficacy of various disinfection methods in reducing bacterial load on rnes in vitro. design and setting: in vitro model. interventions: staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae contamination was separately induced on rnes in vitro. two experimental sets were completed. the rnes were disinfected using the following protocols: 30-second scrub with antimicrobial soap (abs) and water, 30-second scrub with 70% isopropyl alcohol (ia), 30-second scrub with abs followed by 30-second scrub with ia, 30-second scrub with germicidal cloth, isolated 5-minute soak in an enzymatic soap solution, 5- and 10-minute soaks in ortho-phthalaldehyde, 0.55%, solution (cidex opa), and isolated 30-second rinse with tap water, all with 30-second precleaning and postcleaning rinses with tap water. two sets of experiments (experiment sets a and b) were carried out with a 30-second tap water rinse after inoculation of each rne. this was followed by immediate cleaning in set a and a 1-hour air-dry delay in set b. otherwise there were no differences in the disinfection protocols between sets for each method noted. main outcomes and measures: effectiveness of various disinfection protocols in cleaning rigid nasal endoscopes experimentally inoculated with bacteria commonly found in the upper aerodigestive tract. positive cultures following disinfection indicated ineffective or incomplete disinfection. results: most cleaning methods were effective in eliminating s aureus, s pneumoniae, and h influenzae from the scopes following experimental contamination. continued growth of p aeruginosa was found  after all of the disinfection trials in experiment set a with the exception of a  10-minute immersion in cidex opa, and in set b except for the 10-minute cidex opa immersion and abs plus ia trials. conclusions and relevance: most cleaning methods used in our trials appear to properly disinfect rnes after in vitro inoculation with s aureus, s pneumoniae, and h influenzae. however, it appears that disinfectants may be less effective in cleaning rigid scopes experimentally  inoculated with p aeruginosa. there is a paucity of published data regarding cross-contamination during rigid nasal endoscopy, and these results should guide  future studies and to some extent practice to avoid iatrogenic spread of contamination.

TI  == volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  == ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (vocs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of vocs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. such vocs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. a systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. all six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. since humans do not produce these vocs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. the following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for escherichia coli. notably, several factors that may effect voc production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. in conclusion, vocs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.

TI  == impact of age and comorbidity on cause and outcome in community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == background: prolonged life expectancy has currently increased the proportion of the very elderly among patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap). the aim  of this study was to determine the influence of age and comorbidity on microbial  patterns in patients over 65 years of age with cap. methods: this study was a prospective observational study of adult patients with cap (excluding those in nursing homes) over a 12-year period. we compared patients aged 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and > 85 years for potential differences in clinical presentation, comorbidities, severity on admission, microbial investigations, causes, antimicrobial treatment, and outcomes. results: we studied a total of 2,149 patients: 759 patients (35.3%) aged 65 to 74 years, 941 patients (43.7%) aged 75 to 84 years, and 449 patients (20.8%) aged > 85 years. at least one comorbidity was present in 1,710 patients (79.6%). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups, regardless of comorbidity. staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 9.1% of isolates, and haemophilus influenzae, 6.4%. all these pathogens were  isolated only in patients with at least one comorbidity. mortality increased with age (65-74 years, 6.9%; 75-84 years, 8.9%; > 85 years, 17.1%; p < .001) and was associated with increased comorbidities (neurologic; or, 2.1; 95% ci, 1.5-2.1), pneumonia severity index iv or v (or, 3.2; 95% ci, 1.8-6.0), bacteremia (or, 1.7; 95% ci, 1.1-2.7), the presence of a potential multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogen  (s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae; or, 2.4; 95% ci, 1.3-4.3), and icu admission (or, 4.2; 95% ci, 2.9-6.1) on multivariate analysis. conclusions: age does not influence microbial cause itself, whereas comorbidities are associated with specific causes such as h. influenzae and potential mdr pathogens. mortality in the elderly is mainly driven by the presence of comorbidities and potential mdr pathogens.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == microbes bind complement inhibitor factor h via a common site.
AB  == to cause infections microbes need to evade host defense systems, one of these being the evolutionarily old and important arm of innate immunity, the alternative pathway of complement. it can attack all kinds of targets and is tightly controlled in plasma and on host cells by plasma complement regulator factor h (fh). fh binds simultaneously to host cell surface structures such as heparin or glycosaminoglycans via domain 20 and to the main complement opsonin c3b via domain 19. many pathogenic microbes protect themselves from complement by recruiting host fh. we analyzed how and why different microbes bind fh via domains 19-20 (fh19-20). we used a selection of fh19-20 point mutants to reveal the binding sites of several microbial proteins and whole microbes (haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumonia, candida albicans, borrelia burgdorferi, and borrelia hermsii). we show that all studied microbes use the same binding region located on one side of domain 20. binding of fh to the microbial proteins was inhibited with heparin showing that the common microbial binding site overlaps with the heparin site needed for efficient binding of fh to host cells. surprisingly, the microbial proteins enhanced binding of fh19-20 to c3b and down-regulation of complement activation. we show that this is caused by formation of a tripartite complex between the microbial protein, fh, and c3b. in this study we reveal that seven microbes representing different phyla utilize a common binding site on the domain 20 of fh for complement evasion. binding via this site not only mimics the glycosaminoglycans of the host cells, but also enhances function of fh on the microbial surfaces via the novel mechanism of tripartite complex formation. this  is a unique example of convergent evolution resulting in enhanced immune evasion  of important pathogens via utilization of a "superevasion site."

TI  == changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (canward 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in canadian hospitals.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to analyse canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. methods: all isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual canward surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. a multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. results: the proportion of e. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (p = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011  (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (p > 0.05). among isolates of s. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (p < 0.0001). resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (mdr) phenotypes for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. conclusions: a significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. notably, mdr isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except s. pneumoniae.

TI  == comparison of pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance patterns in paediatric, adult and elderly patients in canadian hospitals.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to describe the association between age groups and antimicrobial resistance in the most commonly identified pathogens in  canadian hospitals. methods: between 2007 and 2011, 27,123 clinically significant isolates, comprising 3580 isolates from children </= 18 years old, 12,119 isolates from adults 19-64 years old and 11,424 isolates from elderly patients aged >/= 65 years old, were collected as part of the canward surveillance study from tertiary-care centres across canada. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to clsi guidelines. a multifactorial logistic regression  model was used to determine the impact of demographic factors, including age groups, on antimicrobial resistance. results: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia  coli, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were in the top five organisms for all of the age groups. the proportions of s. aureus that were methicillin resistant, enterococci that were vancomycin resistant and e. coli that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were 11.2%, 0.7% and 1.0% for children, 22.8%, 4.6% and 4.3% for adults, and 28.0%, 3.8% and 4.9% for the elderly, respectively. notable age-related differences in antimicrobial resistance patterns included the following: significantly less methicillin, clindamycin, clarithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance in s. aureus from children; for e. coli, higher cefazolin and ciprofloxacin resistance  in the elderly and less ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin resistance in isolates from children; more s. pneumoniae isolates with penicillin mics >1 mg/l  in children; and for p. aeruginosa, higher resistance rates for meropenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin in adults. conclusions: the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by age group revealed that resistance rates are often higher in the older age groups; however, considerable variability in age-specific resistance trends for different pathogen-antimicrobial combinations  was noted.

TI  == antibiotic resistance rates in causative agents of infections in diabetic patients: rising concerns.
AB  == the vicious cycle is that hyperglycemia (>/=11.1 mmol/l) or other diabetes-associated factors facilitate or worsen the development of infections and vice versa, the infections deteriorate the glycemic control of the patients.  diabetic patients are prone to some infections, infection recurrences and poor outcomes. immunocompromised state and frequent antibiotic use are associated with antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis (in some studies), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, bacteria in diabetic foot infections and different opportunistic and rare pathogens or multidrug-resistant strains. prompt diagnostics and susceptibility testing, early and aggressive surgical and/or antibiotic therapy, and, importantly, good glycemic control are of utmost importance for treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in diabetic patients.

TI  == clinical measures of disease in adult non-cf bronchiectasis correlate with airway microbiota composition.
AB  == rationale: despite the potentially important roles for infection in adult non-cystic fibrosis (cf) bronchiectasis disease progression, the bacterial species present in the lower airways of these patients is poorly characterised. objectives: to provide a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis of bacterial content of lower airway samples from patients with non-cf bronchiectasis using culture-independent microbiology. methods: paired induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples, obtained from 41 adult patients with non-cf bronchiectasis, were analysed by 16s ribosomal rna gene pyrosequencing. assessment of species distribution and dispersal allowed 'core' and 'satellite' bacterial populations to be defined for this patient group. microbiota characteristics correlated with clinical markers of disease. measurement and main results: 140 bacterial species were identified, including those associated with respiratory tract infections and opportunistic infections more generally. a group of core species, consisting of species detected frequently and in high abundance, was defined. core species included those currently associated with infection in bronchiectasis, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, and many species that would be unlikely to be reported  through standard diagnostic surveillance. these included members of the genera veillonella, prevotella and neisseria. the comparative contribution of core and satellite groups suggested a low level of random species acquisition. bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) and bacterial community composition similarity correlated significantly with fev1, neutrophil count and leicester cough score. conclusions: characteristics of the lower airways microbiota of adult patients with non-cf bronchiectasis correlate significantly with clinical markers of disease severity.

TI  == cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI  == pattern of urinary tract infection in kashmir and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == antibiotic resistance of urinary tract pathogens has increased worldwide. the purpose of this study is to provide information regarding the causative agents of urinary tract infection in kashmiri patients, identify the uropathogens responsible for the infection and study the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens. clean voided mid-stream urine samples were collected from 2190  patients. the specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. the antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined. of 2190 specimens, 591 (27%) showed significant growth upon culture. approximately 84.1% (497/591) of the 591 patients with uti were females, most of which belonged to the 21-30 age group (206). the males accounted for 15.9% (94/591) uti cases. most of the male patients belonged to the 21-30 age group (34). the lowest incidence of urinary tract infections was seen among the 13-20 years age group. throughout this study males accounted for only 16% of all uti cases. escherichia coli was the most predominant isolate, 53.8% followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 22.4% and pseudomonas aeruginosa 7.6%. all isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin, and more than 94% were sensitive to cefuroxime. apart from group d streptococcus, the overall response to ampicillin  by all isolates was less than 15%. the prevalence of multi-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were fully susceptible to cefuroxime and ofloxacin. it is recommended that cefuroxime and ofloxacin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. concurrent with the necessary shift in the prescription pattern, attention should be paid to restriction of antibiotic abuse in the community to retard development of further drug resistance.

TI  == deletion of the gene encoding calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide alpha does not affect the outcome of severe infection in mice.
AB  == procalcitonin (pct) is expressed in nonthryoidal tissues of humans during severe  infections. serum pct levels are measured to diagnose and guide therapy, and there is some evidence that pct may also contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis. we tested whether disruption of the gene encoding pct in mice affected the course of sepsis. mice with exons 2-5 of the gene encoding calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related polypeptide alpha (calca) knocked out and congenic c57bl/6j control mice were challenged with aerosolized streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, or injected intraperitoneally with s. pneumoniae. there were no significant differences in the survival of knockout and control mice in the two pneumonia models, and no significant differences in weight loss, splenic bacterial counts, or blood leukocyte levels in the peritoneal sepsis model. to verify disruption of the calca gene in knockout mice, the absence of calcitonin in the serum of knockout mice and its presence and inducibility in control mice were confirmed. to evaluate pct expression in nonthyroidal tissues of control mice, transcripts were measured in multiple organs. pct transcripts were not significantly expressed in liver or spleen of control mice challenged with aerosolized p. aeruginosa or intraperitoneal endotoxin, and were expressed in lung only at low levels, even though serum il-6  rose 3,548-fold. we conclude that mice are not an ideal loss-of-function model to test the role of pct in the pathogenesis of sepsis because of low nonendocrine pct expression during infection and inflammation. nonetheless, our studies demonstrate that nonendocrine pct expression is not necessary for adverse outcomes from sepsis.

AB  == bacterial pneumonia is one of the leading causes of disease-related morbidity and mortality in the world, in part because the diagnostic tools for pneumonia are slow and ineffective. to improve the diagnosis success rates and treatment outcomes for bacterial lung infections, we are exploring the use of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (sesi-ms) breath analysis as a rapid, noninvasive method for determining the etiology of lung infections in situ. using a murine lung infection model, we demonstrate that sesi-ms breathprints can be used to distinguish mice that are infected with one of seven lung pathogens: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, moraxella  catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, representing the primary causes of bacterial pneumonia worldwide. after applying principal components analysis, we observed that with the first three principal components (primarily comprised of data from 14 peaks), all infections were separable via sesi-ms breathprinting (p < 0.0001). therefore, we  have shown the potential of this sesi-ms approach for rapidly detecting and identifying acute bacterial lung infections in situ via breath analysis.

TI  == short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone-1 is a tightly regulated airway sensor in innate and adaptive immunity.
AB  == short palate, lung, and nasal epithelial clone-1 (splunc1) is a protein abundantly expressed by the respiratory epithelium of the proximal lower respiratory tract, a site of great environmental exposure. previous studies showed that splunc1 exerts antimicrobial effects, regulates airway surface liquid and mucociliary clearance, and suppresses allergic airway inflammation. we studied splunc1 to gain insights into its role in host defense. in the lower respiratory tract, concentrations of splunc1 are high under basal conditions. in  models of pneumonia caused by common respiratory pathogens, and in th1-induced and th2-induced airway inflammation, splunc1 secretion is markedly reduced. pathogen-associated molecular patterns and ifn-gamma act directly on airway epithelial cells to inhibit splunc1 mrna expression. thus, splunc1 is quickly suppressed during infection, in response to an insult on the epithelial surface.  these experiments highlight the finely tuned fluctuations of splunc1 in response  to exposures in the respiratory tract, and suggest that the loss of splunc1 is a  crucial feature of host defense across air-breathing animal species.

AB  == aim: community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is presumed to be bacterial in origin and empirical antibiotics are almost always given on admission. however, early detection of viral infection is also very important for hospital infection control and timely use of antiviral agents. the present study aimed to compare patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia, and identify independent predictors  of viral pneumonia. methods: a prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1-year period. older patients (aged >/= 65 years) were recruited if they were admitted for cap confirmed by chest radiographs. results: a cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa) viral culture. the commonest bacterial isolates were haemophilus influenzae (31), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), klebsiella spp. (9) and streptococcus pneumoniae (6). influenza a virus (28, 8 were pandemic 2009 a/h1n1 subtype) and respiratory syncytial virus (16) were the most frequent  viral causes. independent predictors of viral pneumonia included nursing home residence (rr 3.056, p = 0.009) and absence of leukocytosis (rr 0.425, p = 0.026). conclusions: all nursing home residents hospitalized for cap should undergo npa viral testing because of infection control, early antiviral treatment and discharge planning. we suggest that empirical antiviral agents might be considered for nursing home residents hospitalized for cap if outbreaks of influenza-like illness are reported in nursing homes.

TI  == etiology and outcome of severe community acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults.
AB  == background: community acquired pneumonia (cap) is a commonly encountered disease, one third of which is severe community acquired pneumonia (scap) that can be potentially fatal. there is a paucity of data on etiology and outcome of patients with scap in south asian population. methods: a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from march 2002 till december 2008 on patients of 16 years and above who were admitted with the diagnosis of scap in accordance to the criteria of american thoracic society guidelines (2001). the patients underwent clinical and diagnostic evaluations to detect the severity of illness as well as  the etiology and other risk factors influencing the eventual outcome of scap. results: a total of 189 patients were included in the study. the mean age was 60  +/- 18.0 years and 110 (58%) patients were males. the most common isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (15 patients), streptococcus pneumoniae (14  patients) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (9 patients). the highest mortality was seen in patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa (89%) and staphylococcus aureus (53%). overall mortality rate was 51%. on univariate analysis, septic shock (p <0.001),  prior antibiotic use (p = 0.04), blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dl (p = 0.03), hematocrit < 30% (p = 0.03) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score > 20 (p < 0.001) were significantly different between the patients who survived as compared to those who did not. on multivariate analysis, septic shock (p <0.001, or: 4.70; 95% ci= 2.49-8.87) was found to be independently associated with mortality. conclusion: the microbes causing scap in our study are different from the usual spectrum. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the common causative pathogens and associated with high mortality. it is important to establish clinical guidelines for managing scap according to the etiologic organisms in our setting.

TI  == moxifloxacin susceptibility mediates the relationship between causative organism  and clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis.
AB  == purpose: bacterial keratitis is a sight-threatening infection of the cornea that  is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. in this report, we analyze the role of moxifloxacin susceptibility in the relationship between causative organisms and clinical outcome in bacteria keratitis. methods: a mediation analysis is used to assess the role of moxifloxacin susceptibility in the relationship between causative organisms and clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis using data collected in a randomized, controlled trial. results: in the steroids for corneal ulcers trial (scut), 500 corneal infections were treated with topical moxifloxacin. the outcome of 3-week best spectacle-corrected visual  acuity was significantly associated with an organism (streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc., p = 0.008). an indirect effects mediation model suggests that mic accounted for approximately 13% (95% confidence interval, 3%-24%, p = 0.015) of the effect of the organism on 3-week visual acuity. conclusions: moxifloxacin mediates the relationship between causative organisms and clinical outcome in bacterial keratitis, and is likely on the causal pathway  between the organism and outcome.

TI  == infectious keratitis: secreted bacterial proteins that mediate corneal damage.
AB  == ocular bacterial infections are universally treated with antibiotics, which can eliminate the organism but cannot reverse the damage caused by bacterial products already present. the three very common causes of bacterial keratitis-pseudomonas  aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae-all produce proteins that directly or indirectly cause damage to the cornea that can result in reduced vision despite antibiotic treatment. most, but not all, of these proteins are secreted toxins and enzymes that mediate host cell death, degradation of stromal collagen, cleavage of host cell surface molecules, or induction of a damaging inflammatory response. studies of these bacterial pathogens have determined the proteins of interest that could be targets for future therapeutic options for decreasing corneal damage.

TI  == bacteriology of acute appendicitis and its implication for the use of prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  == background: to prevent surgical site infection (ssi) after appendectomy, antibiotic prophylaxis has been recommended for all patients, but this approach is based largely on bacteriologic findings that are decades old. the objective of this study was to reevaluate the bacteriology of acute appendicitis in order to assess the usefulness of current antibiotic prophylaxis. methods: between january 1 and december 31, 2010, 117 patients with pathology-proved acute appendicitis were recruited. antibiotic prophylaxis was given according to national guidelines. immediately after operation, the luminal contents of the appendices were swabbed for bacterial culture. the charts of the patients were surveyed retrospectively for postoperative complications until june 30, 2011. results: bacteria were isolated from 115 of 117 specimens sent for culture (98%). of the 115 samples that yielded bacteria, all gave rise to aerobic isolates and five yielded mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates. the most common aerobic organism was escherichia coli, which was present in 100 of 117 patients who had pathology-proved acute appendicitis (85%). less frequent organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae (30 cases; 26%), streptococcus spp. (29 cases; 25%), enterococcus spp. (21 cases; 18%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (18 cases; 15%). all p. aeruginosa isolates were sensitive to amikacin, ceftazidime, and cefepime; but seven of the eight were resistant to cefuroxime. eight patients were identified as having had a postoperative ssi, and p. aeruginosa was isolated from five of these cases. the isolation of p. aeruginosa correlated significantly with ssi (p=0.002). conclusions: the most commonly identified aerobic bacteria associated with acute appendicitis were e. coli, followed by k. pneumoniae, streptococcus, enterococcus, and p. aeruginosa. pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently was not covered by the prophylactic antibiotics chosen and might be associated with ssi.

TI  == a reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in lebanon over a decade.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. this study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major  tertiary care center in beirut. methods: data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the cap accredited clinical microbiology laboratory is analyzed from  january 2000 to november 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. results: increasing rates of esbl-producing isolates were noted for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in acinetobacter spp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in e. coli and k. pneumoniae. tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most esbl and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. resistance to quinolones is being encountered in streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in s. pneumoniae, group a streptococci, s. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. conclusion: physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance  to properly guide the initial therapy. these resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.

AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == use of nasopharyngeal culture to determine appropriateness of antibiotic therapy  in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.
AB  == background: rhinosinusitis is one of the top 5 diagnoses for which an antibiotic  is prescribed, often without a clear bacterial etiology. this study evaluated whether nasopharyngeal culture and gram stain could serve as a surrogate for endoscopically obtained middle meatal cultures in directing appropriate therapy for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (abrs). this study also investigated the utility of a rapid sinus test screen in differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial rhinosinusitis. methods: thirty-one adult patients met inclusion criteria for abrs. samples were obtained from both the middle meatus and nasopharynx for gram stain and culture. nasal mucous samples were tested with a rapid sinus test strip measuring ph, levels of protein, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. results: sixty-one percent (61%) of nasopharyngeal and 48% of middle meatal samples grew pathogenic bacteria. the concordance rate was 84% between the 2 sites (p = 0.0006). the following pathogenic organisms were detected: moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. for nasopharyngeal samples, reliance on gram stain alone exhibited a sensitivity of 31% and specificity of 100% and, similarly, for middle meatus samples, 47% and 93%, respectively. the rapid sinus  test revealed a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 7%. conclusion: nasopharyngeal and middle meatal cultures exhibited high concordance for pathogenic bacteria. gram stain exhibited moderate sensitivity and excellent specificity. nasopharyngeal cultures could provide a viable method, especially in a primary care setting, for determining the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. the rapid sinus test's lack of specificity precluded its utility in the  differentiation between bacterial and nonbacterial rhinosinusitis.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == the inflammasome in lung diseases.
AB  == inflammation, the process aimed at restoring homeostasis after an insult, can be  more damaging than the insult itself if uncontrolled, excessive, or prolonged. the inflammasome is an intracellular multimeric protein complex that regulates the maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokines of the il-1 family in response to pathogens and endogenous danger signals. growing evidence indicates that the inflammasome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory diseases. the inflammasome can be activated by the pathogens that account for the most prevalent infectious diseases of the respiratory tract, such as influenza a virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. the inflammasome also plays a role in the chronic inflammation of the airways of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as in the initiation and progression of the inflammatory process in pulmonary fibrosis. the aim of this review is to summarize the most relevant points of inflammasome activation in lung diseases.

TI  == seasonal trends of microbial keratitis in south india.
AB  == purpose: previous studies suggest that fungal keratitis is more common in hot humid climates and that bacterial keratitis is independent of seasonal variation. this study analyzes seasonal trends in the incidence of fungal and bacterial keratitis at the aravind eye hospital in southeast india. methods: using microbiology records from august 2006 to july 2009, retrospective analyses of infectious keratitis were performed. bacterial and fungal keratitis incidence data were analyzed for seasonal patterns. results: among the 6967 infectious keratitis cases, cultures were performed in 5221 (74.9%) cases; among them, 3028  (58%) were positive. of the culture-positive cases, 1908 (63%) and 1081 (35.7%) were of fungal and bacterial etiology, respectively. the predominant fungal organism was fusarium spp (42.3%) and the predominant bacterial organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (35.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.3%), and nocardia spp (8.1%). analyses revealed an uneven distribution of fungal keratitis throughout the year (p < 0.001) with peaks in july and january. no significant seasonal trend was observed for the combined bacterial keratitis group. conclusions: a higher incidence of fungal keratitis occurs during the months corresponding to the windy and harvest seasons, during which time infection from  vegetative corneal injury may be more likely. robust screening efforts during these periods may mitigate visually debilitating sequelae from infectious keratitis.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in children aged 0-16 years--a national study of 678 cases in sweden comparing different age groups.
AB  == objective: to compare the characteristics of acute mastoiditis in children in different age groups in order to identify risk groups and risk factors for acute  mastoiditis. methods: records for all children aged 0-16 years treated for acute  mastoiditis during 1993-2007 at 33 ear, nose and throat departments in sweden were reviewed retrospectively according to defined criteria for acute mastoiditis. results: a total of 678 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age and this group was characterized by less prior history of other diseases and ear diseases, fewer visits to health care centers and less antibiotic treatment before admission, shorter duration of symptoms before admission, hospitalization  for fewer days and lower frequency of complications and mastoidectomies. these children also showed a higher incidence of clinical findings, increased inflammatory markers such as fever and heightened counts of c-reactive protein and white blood cells compared with older children. they also tested positive for significantly more samples of streptococcus pneumoniae while the older children more often exhibited growth of streptococcus pyogenes or pseudomonas aeruginosa or no microbial growth. conclusions: the characteristics of pediatric acute mastoiditis differed significantly between age groups. acute mastoiditis was most common in children younger than two years of age. they showed more rapid progress of symptoms and more distinct signs of acute mastoiditis. this is probably the reason why parents rapidly seek medical care for small children and hospital treatment thus starts earlier in the youngest children, which may in turn explain the excellent outcome. this study showed that younger children have neither more  severe acute mastoiditis nor more complications than older ones. the differences  between age groups suggest that there are distinctions in the pathophysiology behind the onset and course of acute mastoiditis in younger and older children.

TI  == high-throughput multilocus sequence typing: bringing molecular typing to the next level.
AB  == multilocus sequence typing (mlst) is a widely used system for typing microorganisms by sequence analysis of housekeeping genes. the main advantage of  mlst in comparison to other typing techniques is the unambiguity and transferability of sequence data. however, a main disadvantage is the high cost of dna sequencing. here we introduce a high-throughput mlst (himlst) method that  employs next-generation sequencing (ngs) technology (roche 454), to generate large quantities of high-quality mlst data at low costs. the himlst protocol consists of two steps. in the first step mlst target genes are amplified by pcr in multi-well plates. during this pcr the amplicons of each bacterial isolate are provided with a unique dna barcode, the multiplex identifier (mid). in the second step all amplicons are pooled and sequenced in a single ngs-run. the mlst profile of each individual isolate can be retrieved easily using its unique mid. with himlst we have profiled 575 isolates of legionella pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae in mixed species himlst experiments. in conclusion, the introduction of himlst paves the way for a broad employment of the mlst as a high-quality and cost-effective method for typing microbial species.

TI  == one-day workflow scheme for bacterial pathogen detection and antimicrobial resistance testing from blood cultures.
AB  == bloodstream infections are associated with high mortality rates because of the probable manifestation of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock(1). therefore, rapid administration of adequate antibiotic therapy is of foremost importance in  the treatment of bloodstream infections. the critical element in this process is  timing, heavily dependent on the results of bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. both of these parameters are routinely obtained by culture-based testing, which is time-consuming and takes on average 24-48 hours(2, 4). the aim of the study was to develop dna-based assays for rapid identification of bloodstream infections, as well as rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing. the first assay is a eubacterial 16s rdna-based real-time pcr assay complemented with species- or genus-specific probes(5). using these probes, gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli as well as gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., streptococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae could be distinguished. using this multiprobe assay, a first identification of the causative micro-organism was given after 2 h. secondly, we developed a semi-molecular assay for antibiotic susceptibility testing of s. aureus, enterococcus spp. and (facultative) aerobe gram-negative rods(6). this assay was based on a study in which pcr was used to measure the growth of bacteria(7). bacteria harvested directly from blood cultures are incubated for 6 h with a selection of antibiotics, and following a sybr green-based real-time pcr assay determines inhibition of growth. the combination  of these two methods could direct the choice of a suitable antibiotic therapy on  the same day (figure 1). in conclusion, molecular analysis of both identification and antibiotic susceptibility offers a faster alternative for pathogen detection  and could improve the diagnosis of bloodstream infections.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

AB  == bacterial transcription and translation have proven to be effective targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapies owing to the critical role they play in bacterial propagation and the overall conservation of the associated machinery involved. escherichia coli is the most common source of s30 extract used in bacterial in vitro coupled transcription-translation assays, however, transcription-translation assays in other important pathogens including staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae have been described (murray et al., 2001; dandliker et al., 2003). pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important and difficult-to-treat gram-negative pathogen. in a drug discovery program, to de-risk any potential species specificity of novel inhibitors, we developed and optimized a robust method for the preparation of s30 extract from p. aeruginosa strain pao1. further, a p. aeruginosa transcription-translation assay using a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid was validated and compared to an e. coli s30-based system using a wide range of antibiotics encompassing multiple classes  of translation inhibitors. results showed a similar ranking of the activities of  known inhibitors, illustrative of the high degree of conservation between the transcription-translation pathways in both organisms.

TI  == septicemia in patients with aids admitted to a university health system: a case series of eighty-three patients.
AB  == background: patients with aids incur higher rates of infection than the general population. however, little evidence exists to guide family physicians in selecting antibiotics for initial empiric therapy for suspected septicemia. methods: we recorded the causative organisms of septicemia (defined here as bacteremia, fungemia, or both) in 83 patients with aids admitted to the teaching  hospitals of the university of louisville from 1996 to 2006. all patients fulfilled the requirements for a diagnosis of aids on the basis of the 1993 centers for disease control criteria. in addition to the causative organism, demographic information, immunologic data, portal of entry, and mortality were collected. results: only 53% of the patients presented with fever and the median  leukocyte count was 4400 cells/mm(3). the most common organisms causing septicemia were, in decreasing order, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 21; 21.4%), mycobacterium avium complex (n = 10; 10.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9; 9.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n =  9; 9.2%). other pathogens included escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  mrsa. polymicrobial septicemia was identified in 12 cases (14.5% of the episodes). the portals of entry of the organism were (in decreasing order) primary, lung, intravascular line, and skin. the types of organisms found in patients with primary septicemia patterned those found overall. the mortality rate was 12.1%. conclusions: aids patients with septicemia may not present with the signs that would a non-aids patient with septicemia. on the basis of the range of organisms identified in this study, antibiotic coverage of aids patients with suspected septicemia, both in primary septicemia and septicemia overall, should take into consideration bacteremia with a wide range of organisms: gram-positive organisms including mrsa and m. avium complex and gram-negative organisms including pseudomonas species. in addition, physicians should be aware  that polymicrobial septicemia may be present.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections give rise to a different metabolic response in a mouse model.
AB  == metabolomics has become an important tool to study host-pathogen interactions and to discover potential novel therapeutic targets. in an attempt to develop a better understanding of the process of pathogenesis and the associated host response we have used a quantitative (1)h nmr approach to study the metabolic response to different bacterial infections. here we describe that metabolic changes found in serum of mice that were infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa can distinguish between infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. by combining the results of the mouse study with those of bacterial footprinting culture experiments, bacterially secreted metabolites could be identified as potential bacterium-specific biomarkers for p. aeruginosa  infections but not for the other strains. multivariate statistical analysis revealed correlations between metabolic, cytokine and physiological responses. in tlr4 and tlr2 knockout mice, host-response pathway correlated metabolites could be identified and allowed us for the first time to distinguish between bacterial- and host-induced metabolic changes. since gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria activate different receptor pathways in the host, our results suggest that it may become possible in the future to use a metabolomics approach to improve on current clinical microbiology diagnostic methods.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised older patients: incidence, causative organisms and outcome.
AB  == the number of elderly patients in the community with immunosuppressive conditions has increased progressively over recent decades. we sought to determine the incidence, causative organisms and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (cap)  occurring in immunocompromised older patients. we prospectively compared cases of cap in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients admitted to five public hospitals in three spanish regions. of 320 cases studied, 115 (36%) occurred in immunocompromised patients, including: solid or hematological malignancy (97), corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs (44), solid organ or stem cell transplant (five), and other conditions (eight). the etiology  was established in 44% of immunocompromised patients vs. 32% of non-immunocompromised patients (p 0.03). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common causative organism in both groups (29% vs. 21%; p 0.08), followed by legionella pneumophila (3% vs. 6%; p 0.01). gram-negative bacilli were more frequent among immunocompromised patients (5% vs. 0.5%; p <0.01), particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa (3% vs. 0%; p 0.04). nocardiosis was only observed in immunocompromised patients (two cases). bacteremia occurred similarly in the two  groups. no significant differences were found with respect to icu admission (8%,  in both groups) or the length of stay (12.5 vs. 10.4 days). the early (<48 h) (3.5 vs. 0.5%; p 0.04) and overall case-fatality rates (12% vs. 3%; p <0.01) were higher in immunocompromised patients. in conclusion, a substantial number of older patients hospitalized for cap are immunocompromised. although relatively uncommon, cap due to gram-negative bacilli, including p. aeruginosa, is more frequent among these patients. cap occurring in immunocompromised patients causes significant morbidity and mortality.

AB  == objective: post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea has been linked to microbial biofilms. the purpose of this study was to compare the tympanostomy tube-biofilm-forming propensity of common otopathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. study design: controlled, in vitro. setting: academic research laboratory. subjects and methods: fluoroplastic coupons (1656 total, 46 per treatment per incubation period) were exposed to plasma and cultured with 3 strains each of the bacterial species for 2, 4, or 7 days. half of the coupons were treated with antibiotics to kill planktonic bacteria. total and biofilm colony counts and electron microscopy were performed. results: s aureus formed biofilm after 2 days, not different from 4- or 7-day biofilms (p > .05), and was most tolerant to antibiotic treatment. p aeruginosa also formed biofilms at 2 days, reached a plateau at 4 days (p > .05), and decreased at 7 days (p < .01). h influenzae formed biofilm only after 4 days  (p </= .04). s pneumoniae did not form biofilm without catalase supplementation.  with catalase, 1 s pneumoniae strain showed a delay in biofilm formation similar  to h influenzae (p < .0001), while the other 2 strains formed biofilms after 2 days. conclusions: tympanostomy tube biofilm formation occurs with common middle  ear pathogens but most readily with s aureus and p aeruginosa. further investigation is needed to determine if these findings may, in part, explain the  occasionally refractory nature of post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea associated with s aureus and p aeruginosa.

TI  == [antibacterial drug resistance in latin america: consequences for infectious disease control].
AB  == antibacterial drug resistance is a particularly significant issue in latin america. this article explores antimicrobial resistance in three classes of clinically important bacteria: gram-positive bacteria, enterobacteria, and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. the gram-positive bacteria frequently responsible for infections in humans are for the most part cocci: staphylococci,  streptococci (including pneumococci), and enterococci, in both community and hospital settings. this situation is no different in the region of the americas.  among the gram-positive bacteria, the causative agents of bacteremia are most commonly strains of coagulase-negative staphylococcus, followed by enterococci. this report explores the resistance of these species to different antimicrobial drugs, resistance mechanisms in community and hospital strains, and new drugs for treating infections caused by these bacteria. in latin america, antimicrobial resistance in enterococcus strains is still a minor problem compared to the situation in the united states. the strains of the genus streptococcus isolated from respiratory infections are still sensitive to penicillin. furthermore, the resistance of enterobacteria is extremely important in the region, particularly because of the broad dissemination of ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), some of which originated in latin america. this article analyzes the resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. among the nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, while pseudomonas aeruginosa strains remain the leading cause of bacteremia, infections caused by strains of acinetobacter spp. have proliferated extensively in some areas. with regard to antibiotics, several options are available for treating gram-positive bacterial infections. the same cannot be said for infections caused by enterobacteria and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, where options for the  effective treatment of patients are still insufficient.

TI  == complications of port-a-cath(r) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

TI  == bacteria and their toxins tamed for immunotherapy.
AB  == bacterial toxins share the ability to enter host cells to target various intracellular proteins and to modulate host immune responses. over the last 20 years, toxins and their mutated variants, as well as live attenuated bacteria, have been exploited for vaccination and immunotherapy of various infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases. the ability of bordetella pertussis adenylate  cyclase toxin to translocate its adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane, as well as the pathways of intracellular trafficking of bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins, shigella dysenteriae shiga toxin or escherichia coli shiga-like toxin, have been repeatedly exploited for the delivery of antigenic epitopes into host cells and for stimulation of antigen-specific t cell responses. similarly, e. coli alpha-hemolysin, or effector proteins of yersinia and salmonella secreted by the type iii secretion systems, were used to facilitate the delivery of fused heterologous proteins or peptides for antigenic presentation. vibrio cholerae cholera toxin, e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, b. pertussis pertussis toxin or the cry1a protein of bacillus thuringiensis have shown a great potential to act as adjuvants and to stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. the immunotherapeutic potential of some toxins, like clostridium perfringens perfringolysin o, streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin, or streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin needs to be evaluated further. the bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid used as a  vaccine delivery tool, or corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a-based immunotoxins, are currently in various phases of clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy, as are some antigen-delivering salmonella and listeria monocytogenes strains.

TI  == five-year evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing bloodstream infections in iran.
AB  == introduction: bloodstream infections (bsi) are a serious cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. emerging antimicrobial drug resistance among bacterial pathogens causing bsi can limit therapeutic options and complicate patient management. methodology: to encourage the prudent use of appropriate antibiotics  in our pediatric population at children's medical center hospital, tehran, iran,  we studied the frequency and antibiogram patterns of blood culture isolates from  january 2001 to december 2005. results: of 25,223 blood cultures examined, 2,581  (10.23 %) were positive for bacterial growth. the frequency of gram-positive bacteria isolated was 47.6% (1228 of 2581) and that for gram-negatives was 52.4%  (1353 of 2581). the rates of methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were 79% and 89%, respectively. about 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and approximately 66% to penicillin. among the gram-negative isolates, pseudomonas aeruginosa was most frequently isolated, representing 943 (36.7%) over five years. this possibly represents an unrecognized hospital outbreak or contamination of blood culture bottles or other products such as skin disinfectants. additionally, this pathogen showed extremely high rates of antimicrobial resistance. there were notable differences in frequency of the five most common microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, which can help set priorities for focused infection control efforts. conclusions: our findings underscore the need to monitor blood culture isolates and their antimicrobial resistance patterns to observe resistance trends that would influence appropriate empiric treatment and infection control strategies for bacteremic children.

TI  == pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of intensive care unit patients: impact  of duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap), the most common hospital-acquired infection in intensive care unit (icu) patients, is caused by bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients. methods: the current study was focused on 443 bacterial isolates from the lower respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated icu patients (n = 346) in a swedish  university hospital. data were obtained from a prospective infection control database covering 9 y (2002-2010). we analysed the correlation between duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation at the time of sampling on the occurrence of different pathogens. results: duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation prior to sampling was similarly short for streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-streptococci, and haemophilus influenzae (</= 2 days). in contrast, duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation were longest for stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6 and 11 days). for staphylococcus aureus, the most common gram-positive isolate, the duration was longer than for s. pneumoniae but  shorter than for most gram-negative bacteria. with the exception of s. maltophilia and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the median duration of mechanical ventilation was short and similar for most bacteria. in samples taken on the first day of mechanical ventilation, the rate of pathogens expected to be resistant to cefotaxime was 23%. conclusions: the occurrence of pathogens with high antibiotic resistance in the lower respiratory tract increases with increased duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation. an equally important result is that pathogens resistant to third-generation cephalosporins were more common than expected, even after a very short duration of hospital care and mechanical ventilation.

TI  == the impact of intraoperative saline irrigations on bacterial load within the maxillary sinus.
AB  == background: saline irrigations are routinely employed during endoscopic sinus surgery to remove mucous and debris from the sinus cavities. what is unknown is whether this results in a quantitative reduction in pathologic bacteria within the sinus mucosa. the objectives of this study were to quantify the amount of 5 different bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), and streptococcus pneumoniae) within the maxillary sinus and to determine the impact of saline irrigations on bacterial counts. methods: twenty patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were prospectively enrolled. after bilateral maxillary antrostomies, biopsies were taken of the maxillary sinus mucosa prior to any irrigation. in each patient, the left maxillary sinus was then irrigated with 250 cc of normal saline (ns) with a pressurized pulse-irrigation device and the right side was irrigated with 250 cc of ns using a 30-cc syringe attached to a curved suction tip. repeat maxillary sinus mucosal biopsies were then taken from each side. each biopsy was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence and amount of each of the bacteria. results: saline irrigations were found to significantly reduce the amount of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and s. pneumoniae found within the maxillary sinus mucosa. no difference was found for h. influenzae or cns. no difference in bacterial load reduction was able to be shown between the pressurized saline flushes and manual  saline rinse methods. conclusion: intraoperative saline irrigations are able to significantly reduce the amount of potentially pathogenic bacteria within the diseased sinus mucosa.

TI  == pneumonia treated in the internal medicine department: focus on healthcare-associated pneumonia.
AB  == patients with pneumonia treated in the internal medicine department (imd) are often at risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap). the importance of hcap is controversial. we invited physicians from 72 imds to report on all patients with pneumonia hospitalized in their department during 2 weeks (one each in january and june 2010) to compare hcap with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap). we analysed 1002 episodes of pneumonia: 58.9% were cap, 30.6% were hcap and 10.4% were hap. a comparison between cap, hcap and hap showed that hcap patients were older (77, 83 and 80.5 years; p < 0.001), had poorer functional status (barthel 100, 30 and 65; p < 0.001) and had  more risk factors for aspiration pneumonia (18, 50 and 34%; p < 0.001). the frequency of testing to establish an aetiological diagnosis was lower among hcap  patients (87, 72 and 79; p < 0.001), as was adherence to the therapeutic recommendations of guidelines (70, 23 and 56%; p < 0.001). in-hospital mortality  increased progressively between cap, hcap and hap (8, 19 and 27%; p < 0.001). streptococcus pneumoniae was the main pathogen in cap and hcap. pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) caused 17 and 12.3% of hcap. in patients with a confirmed aetiological diagnosis, the independent risk factors for pneumonia due do difficult-to-treat microorganisms (enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa or mrsa) were hcap, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and higher port severity index. our data confirm the importance of maintaining high awareness of hcap among patients treated in imds,  because of the different aetiologies, therapy requirements and prognosis of this  population.

TI  == [epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases of iasi, romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  == infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. the aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. material and methods: a retrospective study was conducted between january 2008 and december 2010 at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. results: from 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). there were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated,  being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (14/18,66%), enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group b streptococcus (3/4%), streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), aerococcus viridans, streptococcus equi, klebsiella pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, sphyngomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of s. aureus. among 16 invazive strains of e. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. there were no e.  coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. the mean mortality rate was 14,66%. conclusions: the high level of resistance of s. aureus and e. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

TI  == different potency of bacterial antigens tlr2 and tlr4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  == the aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) generation. we examined toll-like receptor (tlr)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (lta) staphylococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (lam) mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (pgn) staphylococcus aureus, as well as tlr4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (lps) klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, pophyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli. we also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-, interleukin (il)-6-, ccl5-, and il-10-priming on mast cell cyslt synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. we found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cyslt generation; however, the extent of cyslt release in response to stimulation varied. out of the examined antigens lps p. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cyslt generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/ml). other lpss affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. ltas were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/ml, while lam and pgn stimulated mast cells to maximal cyslt generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/ml. anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) inhibitor significantly diminished cyslt generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. priming with tnf,  il-6 and ccl5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cyslt generation, while il-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cyslt synthesis by mast cells.  these observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cyslts strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.

AB  == health-care-associated pneumonia (hcap) is defined as pneumonia that develops in  patients with a history of recent hospitalization, hemodialysis as an outpatient, residence in a nursing home, outpatient intravenous therapy and home wound care.  we aimed to compare the initial demographic characteristics, causative agents and prognosis between hospitalized hcap and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) patients. hcap and cap patients hospitalized between 01 september 2008-01 september 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. out of 187 patients (131 males, mean age 66.3 +/- 14.3 years) who were hospitalized during one-year period, 98 were diagnosed as hcap and 89 as cap. among hcap patients, 64 (65.3%) had a history of hospitalization in the last 90 days, 26 (26.5%) received outpatient intravenous therapy, 17 (17.3%) had home wound care, 6 (6.1%) were on hemodialysis program in the last 30 days and 4 (4.1%) lived in a nursing home. the causative pathogen was detected in 39 (39.8%) hcap and 8 (9.0%) cap patients. the most frequently isolated microorganisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii in hcap, and streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in cap patients. inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment was documented in 8 (25.8%) of 39 hcap patients, in whom a causative agent was isolated whereas the antibiotic treatment was appropriate in all cap patients. the duration of hospitalization (14.4 +/- 11.4 vs. 10.7 +/- 7.9 days, p= 0.011) and mortality rate (34.7% vs. 9.0%, p< 0.001) were higher in hcap compared with cap patients. as hcap is different than cap in terms of patients' characteristics, causative microorganisms and prognosis, it should be considered  in all patients hospitalized as cap. potentially drug-resistant microorganisms should be taken into consideration in the empirical antibiotic treatment of these patients.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

AB  == investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. however, there are  few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. we cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered ozark  hellbender, cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. this organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of c.  a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969-2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of c.a. bishopi. bacterial isolates included aeromonas hydrophila, a known amphibian pathogen, granulicetella adiacens, gordonai terrae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aerococcus viridans, streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of pseudomonads, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. stutzeri, and p. alcaligenes. fungal isolates included species in the genera penicillium, acremonium, cladosporium, curvularia, fusarium, streptomycetes, and the class hyphomycetes. many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to c. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. to our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a cryptobranchid salamander. the incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in c. a. bishopi may  have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.

TI  == [the first experience of application of pcr techniques in real-time mode to diagnose bacteriemia during postoperational period in cardiosurgery patients].
AB  == the results comparison is made between pcr polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. from  september to december 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. the blood samples for pcr analysis (septifast technique roche diagnostics, switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. the species structure of identified germs was as follows: enteroccocus faecalis - 2, klebsiella pneumonia - 2, enteroccocusfaecium - 1, pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative staphilococcus - 11. all cases of seeding of coagulase negative staphilococcus were interpreted using pcr techniques as negative or contamination. in four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. in cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the pcr techniques  permitted to detect two positive results (staphilococcus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). in three cases of positive hemoculture the pcr techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents  (pseudomonas fluorescens and ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. the pcr techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. this techniques has to be applied  in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of different adenosine analogues.
AB  == nucleoside analogues may represent good candidates for the discovery of new antibacterial agents, therefore, a library of adenosine analogues was assessed for their antibacterial activity, and the relationship between the structure and  activity of these molecules was outlined. antibacterial activity was evaluated against that of reference strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we tested 54 adenosine analogues, modified both at ribose and base moieties, including adenine and 1/3-deazaadenine derivatives substituted in the 2- and/or n(6)-positions and bearing n-9 sugar moieties, such as ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 3'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose or cycloalkyl groups like cyclopentane. the data obtained, mic and minimal bactericidal concentrations demonstrated that the presence of bulky substituents such as cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl rings on the n(6)-amino, together with a chlorine atom in the 2-position, conferred antibacterial activity against the gram-positive group with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 mg l(-1). the intact sugar moiety seemed to be  not essential for antimicrobial activity and nucleosides bearing deoxyribose or cyclopentyl groups associated with bulky substituents in n(6)-position showed good antimicrobial properties. furthermore, n-1 proved to be non-crucial and the  2-chloro-n(6)-cyclooctyl-1-deaza-3'-deoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine compounds were among the more active in the series with an mic of 32 mg l(-1) against staph. aureus and strep. pneumoniae. none of the analogues was active against the two gram-negative species tested. hence, adenosine derivatives bearing bulky substituents in the n(6)-position may represent good lead compounds for the future discovery of a novel series of antibacterial agents.

TI  == [factor analysis of outcomes during drug-resistant bacterial infection treatment].
AB  == factors related to poor outcome in drug-resistant bacterial infection treatment were analyzed based on surveys at 54 national hospital organization facilities. results showed common etiological causes of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus (mrsa) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp). specifically, the odds ratio in the elderly, aged 75 years and older, was 1.473 (p=0.006) for mrsa and 6.401 (p=0.0001) for prsp. among those undergoing tracheal intubation, the odds ratio was 1.767 (p=0.021) for mrsa and 4.185 (p=0.0001) for  prsp, showing that advanced age and tracheal intubation tended to aggravate disease. mrsa-specific causes were pneumonia with an odds ratio of 2.426 (p=0.0001) and sepsis with one of 1.417 (p=0.013). causes specific to multi-drug  resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) were intravenous hyperalimentation (ivh)  with an odds ratio of 2.078 (p=0.0001) and urinary-tract infection with one of 0.566 (p=0.027). the individual roles of these factors in poor outcomes must thus be clarified to develop preventive measures against them.

TI  == validation of a clinical score for assessing the risk of resistant pathogens in patients with pneumonia presenting to the emergency department.
AB  == background: resistant organisms (ros) are increasingly implicated in pneumonia in patients presenting to the emergency department (ed). the concept of healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap) exists to help identify patients infected  with ros but may be overly broad. we sought to validate a previously developed score for determining the risk for an ro and to compare it with the hcap definition. methods: we evaluated adult patients admitted via the ed with bacterial pneumonia (january-december 2010). we defined methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases as ros. the risk score was as follows: 4, recent hospitalization; 3, nursing home; 2, chronic hemodialysis; 1, critically ill. we evaluated the screening value of the score and of hcap by determining their areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (auroc) curves for predicting ros. results: the cohort included 977 patients, and ros were isolated in 46.7%. the most common organisms included mrsa (22.7%), p. aeruginosa (19.1%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (19.1%). the risk score was higher in those with an ro (median score,  4 vs 1; p < .001). the auroc for hcap equaled 0.62 (95% confidence interval [ci], .58-.65) versus 0.71 (95% ci, .66-.73) for the risk score. as a screening test for ros, a score > 0 had a high negative predictive value (84.5%) and could lead  to fewer patients unnecessarily receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. conclusions: ros are common in patients presenting to the ed with pneumonia. a simple clinical risk score performs moderately well at classifying patients regarding their risk for an ro.

TI  == health care-associated pneumonia (hcap): empiric antibiotics targeting methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa predict optimal outcome.
AB  == inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy (iiat) has been associated with decreased survival in patients with health care-associated pneumonia (hcap). we performed a study to determine whether empiric hcap antibiotic regimens targeting methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with greater appropriate therapy. a retrospective cohort study of culture-positive hcap over 6 years (january 2003-december 2008) was performed at  barnes-jewish hospital, a 1200-bed urban teaching hospital. we identified 757 consecutive patients with hcap. iiat was administered to 213 (28%) patients. the  pathogens most frequently associated with iiat included p. aeruginosa (n=60, 28%), mrsa (n=58, 27%), and acinetobacter species (n=32, 15%).multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that empiric anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.34-2.29; p=0.036), empiric anti-mrsa antibiotics (aor, 1.71; 95% ci, 1.36-2.14; p=0.018), infection with streptococcus pneumoniae (aor, 2.82; 95% ci, 2.03-3.91;  p=0.002), absence of acinetobacter species infection (aor, 10.57; 95% ci, 7.29-15.33; p<0.001), absence of p. aeruginosa infection (aor, 1.69; 95% ci, 1.36-2.05; p=0.014), and absence of stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection (aor,  20.43; 95% ci, 9.35-44.66; p<0.001) are independent predictors of appropriate therapy for hcap. our study suggests that initial therapy for hcap should include antibiotics targeting mrsa and p. aeruginosa in order to provide appropriate initial therapy. however, the selection of individual antibiotic agents should be based on local patterns of infection and adjusted when microbiology results become available.

TI  == peptidylarginine deiminases present in the airways during tobacco smoking and inflammation can citrullinate the host defense peptide ll-37, resulting in altered activities.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract is frequently seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and may cause exacerbations leading to disease progression. antimicrobial peptides comprise an important part of innate lung immunity, and not least the cathelicidin human cationic antimicrobial protein-18/ll-37. peptidylarginine deiminases (padis) post-translationally modify proteins by converting cationic peptidylarginine residues to neutral peptidylcitrulline. an increased presence of padi2 and citrullinated proteins was demonstrated in the lungs of smokers. in this study, preformed padi4, stored in granulocytes and extracellularly in the lumina of bronchi, was found in lung tissue of individuals suffering from copd. in vitro, recombinant human padi2 and  padi4 both caused a time- and dose-dependent citrullination of ll-37. the citrullination resulted in impaired antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and nontypable haemophilus influenzae, but less so against pseudomonas aeruginosa. using artificial lipid bilayers, we observed discrete differences when comparing the disrupting activity of native and citrullinated ll-37, suggesting that differences in cell wall composition are important during interactions with whole bacteria. furthermore, citrullinated ll-37 showed higher chemotactic activity against mononuclear leukocytes than did  native ll-37, but was less efficient at neutralizing lipolysaccharide, and also in converting apoptotic neutrophils into a state of secondary necrosis. in addition, citrullinated ll-37 was more prone to degradation by proteases, whereas the v8 endopetidase of s. aureus cleaved the modified peptide at additional sites, compared with native ll-37. together, these findings demonstrate novel mechanisms whereby the inflammation-dependent deiminases padi2 and padi4 can alter the activites of antibacterial polypeptides, affecting the course of inflammatory disorders such as copd.

TI  == [microbiology of surgical site infections in abdominal tract surgery patients].
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the microbiology of surgical infections after abdominal surgery can be of use when prescribing effective empirical antibiotic treatments. method: analysis of surgical infections after abdominal surgery in patients enrolled in the prevalence of infections in spanish hospitals (epine) corresponding to the years 1999-2006. results: during the period of the study, 2,280 patients who were subjected to upper or lower abdominal tract surgery were  diagnosed with an infection at the surgical site (ssi). eight hundred and eighty  three patients (37%) had an operation of the upper abdominal tract (gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic surgery) and 1,447 patients (63%) lower abdominal tract surgery (appendectomy and colon surgery). a total of 2,617 bacterial species were isolated in the 2,280 patients included in the analysis. the most frequent microorganisms isolated were, escherichia coli (28%), enterococcus spp.  (15%), streptococcus spp. (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and staphylococcus aureus (5%, resistant to methicillin 2%). in the surgical infections after upper  abdominal tract procedures, there were a higher proportion of isolations of staphylococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp. and candida albicans and less escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium  spp. conclusion: the microbiology of ssi produced after upper abdominal tract surgery did not show any significant differences compared to those of the lower tract. however, more cases of ssi were detected due to staphylococci, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp. and candida albicans and less caused by escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium spp.

TI  == synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains on tyramine (tyr) and also other biogenic amines (ba) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (fbp) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) was investigated by using a rapid hplc method. significant differences were observed among the fbp strains in ammonia (amn) and  ba production apart from tryptamine, histamine (his) and spermine formation (p<0.05). salmonella paratyphi a was characterised as the main amine producer. lab had an important synergetic role in some ba production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some lab strains on ba production was strain-dependent. lactococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher tyr accumulation by aeromonas hydrophila and enterococcus faecalis in tdb. the presence of lactococcus and/or lactobacillus in tdb significantly increased his production by a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, ent. faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas his accumulation was significantly reduced by staphylococcus aureus, s. paratyphi a and listeria monocytogenes.

TI  == elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia: optimal treatment strategies.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is a common infectious disease that still causes substantial morbidity and mortality. elderly people are frequently affected, and several issues related to care of this condition in the elderly have to be considered. this article reviews current recommendations of guidelines with a special focus on aspects of the care of elderly patients with cap. the most common pathogen in cap is still streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by other  pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella species. antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, especially with regard to macrolide-resistant s. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. with regard to beta-lactam antibacterials, resistance by h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis is important, as is the emergence of multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the main management decisions should be guided by the severity of disease, which can be assessed by validated clinical risk scores such as curb-65, a tool for measuring the severity of pneumonia based on assessment of confusion, serum urea, respiratory rate and blood pressure in patients aged >/=65 years. for the treatment of low-risk pneumonia, an aminopenicillin such as amoxicillin with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor is frequently recommended. monotherapy with macrolides is also possible, although macrolide resistance is of concern. when predisposing  factors for special pathogens are present, a beta-lactam antibacterial combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or the combination of a beta-lactam antibacterial, a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a macrolide, may be warranted. if possible, patients who have undergone previous antibacterial therapy should receive drug classes not previously used. for hospitalized patients with non-severe pneumonia, a common recommendation is empirical antibacterial therapy  with an aminopenicillin in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or with fluoroquinolone monotherapy. with proven legionella pneumonia, a combination of beta-lactams with a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide is beneficial. in severe pneumonia, ureidopenicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones are used. a combination of a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibacterial (e.g. cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), piperacillin/tazobactam and a macrolide is mostly recommended. in patients with a predisposition for pseudomonas aeruginosa, a combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem and levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin is frequently used. treatment duration of more than 7 days is not generally recommended, except for proven infections with p. aeruginosa, for which 15 days of treatment appears to be appropriate. further care issues in all hospitalized patients are timely administration of antibacterials, oxygen supply  in case of hypoxaemia, and fluid management and dose adjustments according to kidney function. the management of elderly patients with cap is a challenge. shifts in antimicrobial resistance and the availability of new antibacterials will change future clinical practice. studies investigating new methods to detect pathogens, determine the optimal antimicrobial regimen and clarify the duration of treatment may assist in further optimizing the management of elderly patients  with cap.

TI  == direct evaluation of pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm mediators in a chronic infection model.
AB  == biofilms contribute to pseudomonas aeruginosa persistence in a variety of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, burn wounds, and chronic suppurative otitis  media. however, few studies have directly addressed p. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo. we used a chinchilla model of otitis media, which has previously been used  to study persistent streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae infections, to show that structures formed in vivo are biofilms of bacterial and  host origin within a matrix that includes psl, a p. aeruginosa biofilm polysaccharide. we evaluated three biofilm and/or virulence mediators of p. aeruginosa known to affect biofilm formation in vitro and pathogenesis in vivo--bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric gmp (c-di-gmp), flagella, and quorum sensing--in a chinchilla model. we show that c-di-gmp overproduction has a positive impact on bacterial persistence, while quorum sensing increases virulence. we found no difference in persistence attributed to flagella. we conclude from these studies  that a chinchilla otitis media model provides a means to evaluate pathogenic mediators of p. aeruginosa and that in vitro phenotypes should be examined in multiple infection systems to fully understand their role in disease.

TI  == intragenomic and intraspecific heterogeneity of the 16s rrna gene in seven bacterial species from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients assessed by pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis.
AB  == 16s rrna gene-based cultivation-independent methods are increasingly used to study the diversity of microbiota during health and disease. one bias of these methods is the variability of 16s rrna gene that may exist among strains of a same species (intraspecific heterogeneity) or between rrs copies in a genome (intragenomic heterogeneity). we evaluated the level of intraspecific and intragenomic 16s rdna variability in seven species frequently encountered in respiratory tract samples in cystic fibrosis (cf). a total of 179 strains were subjected to v3 region 16s rdna pcr-ttge. using this easy-to-perform and rapid method, different levels of v3 region rrs heterogeneity were demonstrated. no intraspecific and intragenomic rrs heterogeneity was demonstrated for moraxella catarrhalis (n=16), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=31) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n=14) showing a single pcr-ttge band characteristic of the species. low level of intraspecific heterogeneity was observed for staphylococcus aureus (n=30), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=29) and achromobacter xylosoxidans (n=28), and 17%, 38% and 96% of these strains showed intragenomic heterogeneity (two to four  different rrs copies), respectively. haemophilus influenzae (n=31) displayed the  higher level of intraspecific variability with 23 different pcr-ttge patterns and 61% of the strains showed intragenomic rrs heterogeneity (two to four different rrs copies). although only one hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was explored, intraspecific and intragenomic rrs heterogeneity was frequently observed in this study and should be taken into consideration for a better interpretation of 16s rrna gene-based diversity profiles in denaturing gels and to avoid any overestimation of the respiratory microbiota diversity in cf.

TI  == a retrospective study of health care-associated pneumonia patients at aichi medical university hospital.
AB  == health care-associated pneumonia (hcap) was defined in the american thoracic society/infectious disease society of america guidelines on hospital-acquired pneumonia in 2005. however, little is known about the occurrence of hcap in japan. a retrospective review of background characteristics, pathological conditions, causative organisms, initial treatments, and risk factors for hcap was conducted to determine the relationship of hcap to community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. thirty-five patients who were admitted to our hospital for pneumonia acquired outside our hospital were included and were stratified by disease severity according to the japanese respiratory society risk stratification guidelines (a-drop [age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and shock blood pressure] criteria). all patients had an underlying disease. a total of 70 microbial strains (25 gram-positive, 37 gram-negative, 6 anaerobic, and 2 causative of atypical pneumonia) were isolated  from sputum cultures, showing high isolation frequencies of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and extremely low isolation frequencies of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. "history of hospitalization  within 90 days before the onset of pneumonia" was the most common risk factor, and most of the patients had two or three risk factors. initially, monotherapy [mainly tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc), ceftriaxone (ctrx), cefepime (cpfm), carbapenems, or fluoroquinolones] or combination therapy (beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone) were administered and gave  clinical effects in 63% (22/35) of cases. bacteriological effects were seen in most strains (57%; 40/70). since the causative organisms of hcap were closely related to those of hospital-acquired pneumonia and not to community-acquired pneumonia, we believe that aggressive chemotherapy using broad-spectrum antimicrobials is needed in the initial treatment.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

AB  == this study examined the susceptibility of a variety of wild-type strains and efflux pump mutants to besifloxacin and the comparator agents sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, and ethidium bromide. organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus (mepa or nora), streptococcus pneumoniae (pmra, patb), escherichia coli (acrab::tn903, tolc::tn10), haemophilus influenzae (acrab) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mepab-oprm, oprm::omegahg(r) rpsl). the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of besifloxacin and comparators were also measured in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine, carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenyl- hydrazone, or sodium orthovanadate. overall, very few meaningful changes (>2-fold) in besifloxacin mic values resulted from the presence of efflux pump mutations or efflux pump inhibitors. in summary, the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin is no exception to the observation that newer fluoroquinolones are generally less affected by efflux pump-mediated resistance than older fluoroquinolones.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a new class of bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors.
AB  == this paper characterizes n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as dna gyrase inhibitors. gyramide a was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. in this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified dna gyrase as the primary  target of gyramide a. the gyramide a resistance-determining region in dna gyrase  is adjacent to the dna cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. we studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides a-c in combination with the gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor mc-207,110 (60 mum). the gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 mum against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against enterococcus faecalis. the ic(50) of gyramides a-c against e. coli dna gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 mum. the n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in dna gyrase.

TI  == pathogen yield and antimicrobial resistance patterns of chronic rhinosinusitis patients presenting to a tertiary rhinology centre.
AB  == objectives: to examine the yield and resistance profile of pathogens in chronic rhinosinusitis (crs) patients receiving culture-directed management and to pay particular attention to the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in this population. study design: retrospective review of a crs microbiology database. participants: consecutive crs patients seen at the st. paul's sinus centre between june 2007 and august 2008. setting: canadian tertiary sinus centre. main outcome measure: to determine the pathogens isolated, the frequency of these pathogens, and their resistance profiles. results: the most common bacterial pathogens isolated were staphylococcus aureus, accounting for 39% of cultured samples, followed by haemophilus influenzae (29%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and moraxella catarrhalis (11%). only three cases of mrsa were found, one in a patient with cystic fibrosis. conclusion: mrsa does not appear to pose a significant risk of morbidity in our patient population. however, ongoing concern regarding the increasing prevalence of s. aureus and antimicrobial resistance in chronic sinonasal disease highlights the importance of using culture-directed antimicrobial therapy with the goal of minimizing future resistance patterns.

TI  == sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. it is approved in japan for use  in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococcus spp., enterococcus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae. in terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in  otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, c. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin  recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.

TI  == ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("mamef").
AB  == certain serovars of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is  needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. an innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (mamef). we have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oric locus common to all salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. we have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. following lysis and dna release, as little as 1 cfu of salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can  detect oric from salmonella serovars typhi, paratyphi a, paratyphi b, paratyphi c, typhimurium, enteritidis and choleraesuis but does not detect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or acinetobacter baumanii. we have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic salmonella oric oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with pbs. these pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant  body fluids).

TI  == phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala (asteraceae).
AB  == some vernonia species (vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala) used in northern nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. the antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the nccls was carried out on klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysentriae, proteus mirabilis  and pseudomonas fluorescence. the results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the vernonia species being studied.  the activity of chloroform fraction of v. blumeoides was higher on c. ulcerans and k. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of v. oocephala and v.  ambigua were more active on p. mirabilis (27 mm) and s. typhi (22 mm), respectively. it is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against mrsa. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/ml for all the organisms tested. the mic of 1.25 mg/ml exhibited by the chloroform fractions on  both gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the  vernonia species being studied. phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. the antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. the overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. this lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.

TI  == [epidemiology and aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (cap)].
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia is a frequent disease. case-fatality rate and incidence are increasing with age. the german nation-wide competence network capnetz presents reliable data on aetiology and course of the disease, based on more than 9000 prospectively observed patients. this review discusses current capnetz-publication and their impact on daily clinical practice. the most frequent isolated pathogen isolated was streptococcus pneumoniae. according to capnetz results, the importance of atypical pathogens (i. e. mycoplasma spp., chlamydia spp., legionella spp.) may have been overestimated in older studies: chlamydia pneumoniae (< 1 %) are rarely found, and the most frequent atypical pathogen, mycoplasma spp., causes only mild disease in younger patients resulting in a very low case-fatality-rate (0.7 %). only hospitalized patients with legionella infections are at an increased risk to die. gram-negative enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa are rare, restricted to high-risk patient groups (e. g. mulitmorbidity, enteral tube feeding), but are associated with an increased case-fatality rate.

TI  == hydroalcoholic extract based-ointment from punica granatum l. peels with enhanced in vivo healing potential on dermal wounds.
AB  == the present study reports for the first time, the in vivo wound healing potential of punica granatum l. peels. a 5% (w/w) methanolic extract based-ointment was formulated and evaluated for its wound healing in guinea pigs. the ointment was applied in vivo on the paravertebral area of twelve excised wounded models once a day for 10 consecutive days. the ointment significantly enhanced the wound contraction and the period of epithelialization as assessed by the mechanical (contraction rate, tensile strength), the biochemical (increasing of collagen, dna and proteins synthesis) and the histopathological characteristics. such investigation was encouraged by the efficiency of the methanolic extract as antimicrobial and antioxidant. indeed, the extract showed antioxidant activity as strong as natural and synthetic compounds (trolox, bha, quercetin). furthermore,  the extract exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all tested bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella anatum, salmonella typhimurium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and fungi candida albicans, candida glabrata, trichopyton rubrum and aspergillus niger. the formulated ointment might well find use as skin repair agent without hazard to human health based on these results and on the fact that it has been well established that the extracts of pomegranate used in conditions similar to those  applied by traditional medicine, showed no toxic effects.

TI  == polyreactivity of monoclonal antibodies made against human erythrocyte membranes  with various pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == glycophorins comprise the major sialoglycoproteins of the human erythrocyte membrane. several years ago we described a murine monoclonal antibody (mab), designated 124,d-7 (igm), developed by in vitro immunization with human erythrocyte membranes as antigen. we found the mab reacted with a neuraminidase-dependent epitope on glycophorin a. recent findings using elisa with various bacteria as coating antigens have demonstrated strong cross-reactions of mab 124,d-7 with some bacteria like legionella and no reaction with bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae. a second mab, 130,e-4 (igm), generated by the in vitro immunization technique, agglutinated human red cells irrespective of blood groups. this mab showed strong cross-reactions with bacteria different from those being positive with mab 124,d-7. the broad cross-reactivities of the two mabs suggested that they are polyreactive antibodies. sequencing of the v(h) and v(l) genes of mab 124,d-7 showed germ-like sequences characteristic of polyreactive antibodies. the nucleotide sequences of  the v(h) and v(l) genes of mab 124,d-7 matched sequences coding for antibodies against cd34 and cross-reacting streptococcal antibodies. for legionella pneumophila, the main interacting band on immunoblots was identified as the major outer membrane protein by mass spectrometry after separation by isoelectric focusing followed by sds-page. flow cytometry showed that the epitope for mab 124,d-7 was not displayed on live l. pneumophila but became exposed after heat treatment. studies with one of the control mabs, 145,f-2, directed against phosphorylcholine, which is known to be present on erythrocytes and some bacteria, showed that the epitope is deeply buried in the human erythrocyte membrane as neither neuraminidase nor papain exposed the epitope. the positive control mab 3/1 directed against an epitope on lps of l. pneumophila revealed weak cross-reactions with pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == airway microbiology and host defences in paediatric non-cf bronchiectasis.
AB  == bronchiectasis in children without cystic fibrosis is most common in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. recurrent pneumonia in early childhood and defective pulmonary defences are important risk factors. these help establish a 'vicious cycle' of impaired mucociliary clearance, infection, airway  inflammation and progressive lung injury. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the main infecting pathogens. h. influenzae predominates across all ages, while p. aeruginosa is found in older children with advanced disease. it is uncertain whether viruses and upper airway commensal bacteria play an important aetiological role. overall, the microbiological data are limited however and there are difficulties obtaining reliable respiratory specimens from young children. bronchiectasis is a complex disorder resulting from susceptibility to pulmonary infection and poorly regulated respiratory innate and adaptive immunity. airway inflammatory responses are excessive and persist, even once infection is cleared. improved specimen collection, molecular techniques and biomarkers are needed to enhance management.

AB  == although hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (hdap) was included among the healthcare-associated pneumonias (hcap) in the 2005 american thoracic society (ats)/infectious diseases society of america (idsa) guideline, little information relevant to clinical epidemiology, especially microbiological characteristics, is available. this study aimed to reveal microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of hdap and to assess whether hdap should be included in the hcap category. we retrospectively analyzed 69 hdap patients [42 with moderate and 27 with severe disease based on a-drop (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure)] in whom sputum cultures were performed at our hospital between 2007 and 2009. the most common pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (37.7%), which were composed of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (27.5%) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) (10.1%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (10.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), haemophilus influenzae (7.2%), and moraxella catarrhalis (5.8%). this distribution mostly resembled the microbiological characteristics of hcap reported previously, except that the frequency of multi-drug-resistant (mdr) gram negatives such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%) was clearly lower and that of mrsa was higher. there were no significant differences in microbiological findings, including the incidence of mdr pathogens, between the two severity groups. despite most cases (82.6%) receiving only monotherapy, the prognosis (30-day survival and in-hospital mortality rates were 88.4% and, 17.4%, respectively) was similar to the past hcap reports, but there were no significant correlations between prognosis and presence of mdr pathogens (30-day mortality rates 18.2% in mdr positive vs. 8.5% in mdr negative; p = 0.242). assessment for  not only mdr pathogens, but also severity of illness by the a-drop system made it possible to conduct stratification based on prognosis. our results suggest that hdap should be included in the hcap category, while understanding that there are  some differences.

TI  == microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  == most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. the most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (prevotella  and porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with hiv infection, and in cystic fibrosis. fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. the microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

TI  == community-acquired pneumonia in patients with liver cirrhosis: clinical features, outcomes, and usefulness of severity scores.
AB  == we performed an observational analysis of a prospective cohort of nonimmunocompromised hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia (cap)  to determine the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis. we also analyzed the prognostic value of several severity scores. of 3420 cap episodes, 90 occurred in patients with liver cirrhosis. the median value of the model for end-stage liver disease (meld) was 14 (range, 6-36). on the child-pugh (cp) score, 56% of patients were defined as grade b and  22% as grade c. patients with liver cirrhosis were younger (61.8 vs. 66.8 yr; p = 0.001) than patients without cirrhosis, more frequently presented impaired consciousness at admission (33% vs. 14%; p < 0.001) and septic shock (13% vs. 6%; p = 0.011), and were more commonly classified in high-risk pneumonia severity index (psi) classes (classes iv-v) (74% vs. 58%; p = 0.002). streptococcus pneumoniae (47% vs. 33%; p = 0.009) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.4% vs. 0.9%; p  = 0.001) were more frequently documented in patients with cirrhosis. bacteremia was also more common in these patients (22% vs. 13%; p = 0.023). areas under the  curve (aucs) from disease-specific scores (meld, cp, psi, and curb-65 [confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age >/=65 yr]) were comparable in predicting severe disease (30-d mortality and intensive care unit [icu] admission). a new score based on meld, multilobar pneumonia, and septic shock at  admission (meld-cap) had an auc of 0.945 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.872-0.983) for predicting severe disease and was significantly different from other scores. early (5.6% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.048) and overall (14.4% vs. 7.4%; p < 0.024) mortality rates were higher in cirrhotic patients than in patients without cirrhosis. factors associated with mortality were impaired consciousness, multilobar pneumonia, ascites, acute renal failure, bacteremia, icu admission, and meld score. among the severity scores, meld-cap was the only score associated with severe disease (odds ratio [or], 1.33; 95% ci, 1.09-1.52) and mortality (or, 1.21; 95% ci, 1.03-1.42). in conclusion, cap in patients with liver cirrhosis presents a distinctive clinical picture and is associated with higher mortality than is found in patients without cirrhosis. the severity of hepatic dysfunction  plays an important role in the development of adverse events. cirrhosis-specific  scores may be useful for predicting and stratifying cirrhotic patients with cap who have a high risk of severe disease.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == antibacterial properties of artificial eyes containing nano-sized particle silver.
AB  == background: the long-term use of an artificial eyes can lead to complications. persistent physical stimulation and foreign body contact cause secondary infections. secondary infection is an important complication after the placement  of a artificial eyes and may be difficult to control without removing the artificial eyes. because of these complications, patients get difficulties to wear prosthesis. furthermore artificial eyes can change the normal bacterial flora of the patient's conjunctiva. such postoperative infections might be overcome by improving the antimicrobial properties of the prosthesis surface. methods: the space in the mold previously occupied by wax was filled with polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) resin containing silver at a concentration of 300-700 ppm (parts per million) and the prosthesis was then heat cured. microorganisms were grown on the treated and control surfaces. we cultured for 24 hours, then counted the number of bacteria in resin compositions containing nano-sized silver particles and controls (stomacher 400((r)) poly-bag). results:  the surface of the artificial eye containing silver grew significantly fewer streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli on in vitro bacterial cultures. the antimicrobial activity was 4.8-6.2 times stronger than for the controls. the numbers of bacteria decreased by 99.9% using the pmma resin containing silver. conclusion: the artificial eyes  containing silver that were produced in this study have antibacterial activity, cause little eye discharge, and emit far-infrared rays and anions, all of which promote the ocular health of the person wearing the artificial eye.

TI  == antimicrobial drug resistance in taiwan.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. in taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (xdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant candida species. in addition, the emergence of xdr mycobacterium  tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. a few clones of xdr a. baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (st 59) have  disseminated in taiwanese hospital settings. besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in xdr p aeruginosa strains throughout taiwan. an end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.

TI  == a multicentre surveillance study on the characteristics, bacterial aetiologies and in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of  chronic bronchitis.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and the prevalence is high in many asian countries. methods: a prospective observational  study of the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) was conducted in indonesia, philippines, korea, thailand, malaysia, taiwan and hong kong from august 2006 to april 2008. the diagnosis of aecb was based on  increased cough and worsening of two of following: dyspnoea, increased sputum volume or purulence. patients who had taken antibiotics within 72 h of presentation were excluded. all bacterial strains were submitted to a central laboratory for re-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 16 antimicrobial agents according to clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: four hundred and seven isolates were identified among 447 patients of aecb. the most frequent organisms isolated were klebsiella pneumoniae and associated species (n = 91 + 17), haemophilus influenzae (n = 71), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 63), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 32), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 22) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 21). according to clinical and laboratory standards institute susceptibility breakpoints, 85.7% and >90% of these pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin and cefepime respectively. other options with overall lower susceptibilities include imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. conclusions: gram-negative bacteria including klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. constitute a large proportion of pathogens identified in patients with aecb in some asian countries. surveillance  on the local prevalence and antibiotic resistance of these organisms is important in guiding appropriate choice of antimicrobials in the management of aecb.

TI  == the role of heat shock protein 70 in mediating age-dependent mortality in sepsis.
AB  == sepsis is primarily a disease of the aged, with increased incidence and mortality occurring in aged hosts. heat shock protein (hsp) 70 plays an important role in both healthy aging and the stress response to injury. the purpose of this study was to determine the role of hsp70 in mediating mortality and the host inflammatory response in aged septic hosts. sepsis was induced in both young (6-  to 12-wk-old) and aged (16- to 17-mo-old) hsp70(-/-) and wild-type (wt) mice to determine whether hsp70 modulated outcome in an age-dependent fashion. young hsp70(-/-) and wt mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture, pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, or streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia had no differences in mortality, suggesting hsp70 does not mediate survival in young septic hosts. in contrast, mortality was higher in aged hsp70(-/-) mice than aged wt mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (p = 0.01), suggesting hsp70 mediates mortality in sepsis in an age-dependent fashion. compared with wt mice, aged septic hsp70(-/-) mice had increased gut epithelial apoptosis and pulmonary inflammation. in addition, hsp70(-/-) mice had increased systemic levels of tnf-alpha, il-6, il-10, and il-1beta compared with wt mice. these data demonstrate that hsp70 is a key determinant of mortality in aged, but not young hosts in sepsis. hsp70 may play a protective role in an age-dependent response to sepsis by preventing excessive gut apoptosis and both pulmonary and systemic inflammation.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in infections of copd patients.
AB  == a key characteristic of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is the persistent presence of bacteria in the lower airways. the most commonly isolated bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of copd patients are nontypeable haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae, with growing evidence of the significance of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in severe copd disease. this review focuses on the antibiotic resistant mechanisms associated with the gram-negative bacteria h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis and comparison with p. aeruginosa infection because of the recent  evidence of its significance in patients with severe copd disease. these mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis are  mostly associated with serine beta-lactamases of class a type, whereas p. aeruginosa strains exhibit a much broader repertoire with class a-d type mechanisms. other mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include membrane permeability, efflux pump systems and mutations in antimicrobial targets. antimicrobial resistance within biofilm matrices appears to be different to the mechanisms observed when the bacteria are in the planktonic state. p. aeruginosa  exhibits a more numerous and diverse range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in comparison to m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. the recognition that p. aeruginosa is associated with exacerbations in patients with more severe copd and that turnover in infecting strains is detected (unlike in cystic fibrosis patients), then further investigation is required to better understand the contribution of antimicrobial resistance and other virulence mechanisms to poor clinical outcomes to improve therapeutic approaches.

AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == we should be measuring genomic bacterial load and virulence factors.
AB  == objective: to describe relevant pathogen-related characteristics and their impact on sepsis pathogenesis and prognosis. data source: current literature regarding genomic bacterial load and virulence factors, with an emphasis on the impact of these factors on pathophysiology and prognosis of sepsis. data extraction and synthesis: the current paradigm on sepsis pathophysiology and management overlooks aspects concerning the nature and characteristics of the infecting pathogen. our findings suggest that evaluation of genomic bacterial load might be useful to assess severity and predict prognosis in septic patients; its use during treatment for monitoring clinical response is another interesting potential application. virulence factors identification might help to develop pathogen-specific therapeutic strategies for higher-risk septic patients. conclusions: the recognition of the importance of quantifying the pathogen has major clinical implications and will open up a new field of exploration of therapies targeted at anticipating development and appropriate treatment in severe sepsis. the improved detection and understanding of bacterial virulence factors may lead to specific therapies.

TI  == proposal of protocols using d-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2h-tetrazolium hydroxide (xtt) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

TI  == interferon-gamma production by neutrophils during bacterial pneumonia in mice.
AB  == rationale: neutrophils are usually the first circulating leukocytes to respond during bacterial pneumonia. their expression of oxidants, proteases, and other mediators present in granules is well documented, but their ability to produce mediators through transcription and translation after migration to an inflammatory site has been appreciated only more recently. interferon (ifn)-gamma is a cytokine with many functions important in host defense and immunity. objectives: to examine the expression and function of ifn-gamma in bacterial pneumonias. methods: ifn-gamma mrna and protein were measured in digests of mouse lungs with 24-hour bacterial pneumonia. bacterial clearance was studied with ifn-gamma-deficient mice. measurements and main results: streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus each induce expression of ifn-gamma mrna and protein by neutrophils by 24 hours. only neutrophils that have migrated into pneumonic tissue produce ifn-gamma. deficiency of hck/fgr/lyn, rac2, or gp91(phox) prevents ifn-gamma production. ifn-gamma enhances bacterial clearance and is required for  formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. in contrast, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and escherichia coli induce production of ifn-gamma mrna but not protein. during  pneumonia induced by e. coli but not s. pneumoniae, neutrophils produce micrornas that target the 3' untranslated region of the ifn-gamma gene. conclusions: s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, but not p. aeruginosa and e. coli, induce emigrated neutrophils to produce ifn-gamma within 24 hours. hck/fgr/lyn, rac2, and nadph oxidase are required for ifn-gamma production. ifn-gamma facilitates bacterial clearance at least in part through regulating formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. differential expression by neutrophils of micrornas that target the 3' untranslated region of the ifn-gamma gene may contribute to the pathogen-specific regulation of translation.

TI  == investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly japanese.
AB  == objective: pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. several opportunistic pathogens, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. we investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. materials and methods: we studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. furthermore, the presence of  occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. results: oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). in addition, age was a significant factor for the presence  of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). conclusion: positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant  factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.

TI  == [experience accumulated in hospital setting with levofloxacin, in monotherapy and in association therapy].
AB  == levofloxacin possesses a wide antimicrobial spectrum which encompasses gram positive (also including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram  negative, and atypical respiratory pathogens chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae) as well. comparative clinical studies (macrolides, beta-lactams, and other fluoroquinolones), have evidenced bacteriological and clinical efficacy in community-acquired pneumonia (cap), acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, urinary tract infections, and skin and  soft tissue infections. in clinical practice, levofloxacin in sequential therapy  allowed to reduce length of stay, the efficacy being maintained unaltered. in severe pneumonia, or when a pseudomonas aetiology is suspected, an association therapy is suggested, although a reliable body of clinical evidence is still lacking. recent in vitro studies showed a synergism between levofloxacin and imipenem against multiresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. a recent italian  clinical study evidenced the good efficacy and tolerability profile of prophylactic use of levofloxacin in neutropenic patients with cancer. such a prophylaxis reduced number of febrile episodes, at a statistically significant level, and mortality (although at a not statistically significant level).

TI  == nursing home-acquired pneumonia: a review of risk factors and therapeutic approaches.
AB  == objective: to review the risk factors, etiologic profile, treatment approaches, and guidelines for the management of nursing home-acquired pneumonia (nhap). research design and methods: a search of the current literature was conducted using the medline and embase databases. this search, limited to studies performed in humans and published in english between january 1, 1990 and october 31, 2009,  included the terms 'acquired pneumonia', 'associated pneumonia', 'nursing home',  'long-term care', 'institution', and 'healthcare'. results: older age, male gender, swallowing difficulty, and inability to take oral medications are all significant risk factors for pneumonia. medications such as antipsychotics and anticholinergics, histamine receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors have also been linked to higher risk of pneumonia. the etiology of nhap overlaps with  that of community-acquired pneumonia (cap), with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae as predominant pathogens in long-term care facilities. in  patients who require hospitalization, chlamydophila pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and influenza virus have also been identified. in contrast, the etiology  of severe nhap overlaps with that of hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap), with s. aureus, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric gram-negative bacilli as important causative pathogens. therapy is dependent on disease severity and, on the treatment setting. respiratory fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams plus a macrolide are recommended in patients with nhap. patients hospitalized with severe nhap may require triple combination  therapy that covers both mrsa and p. aeruginosa. however, there is little evidence of the clinical superiority of one regimen over another, making it challenging to establish guidelines for the treatment of nhap in the nursing home setting. conclusion: there is a pressing need for clinical trials of antibiotic therapy in nursing home patients that would help establish uniform guidelines to  standardize therapy in the nursing home setting.

TI  == antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinical isolates of respiratory bacterial pathogens in the northeastern region of japan in 2007.
AB  == as the increasing prevalence of resistant strains of respiratory bacterial pathogens has recently been reported, continuous monitoring of the susceptibility of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents is important. we performed a surveillance study focusing on the susceptibility of major respiratory bacterial  pathogens in the northeastern region of japan to carbapenems and control drugs. a total of 168 bacterial strains isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in 2007 were collected and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)  determined. mic data were subjected to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis with monte carlo simulation to calculate the probability of achieving the target  of time above mic with each carbapenem. all moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus  pneumoniae, and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. despite the increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant strains, all haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to meropenem. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility rates for meropenem and biapenem were 76.7%, and the highest probability of achieving pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above mic) was obtained with meropenem 0.5 g three times daily as a 4-h infusion (89.4%), followed by meropenem 0.5 g four times daily as a 1-h infusion (88.4%). carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.

TI  == overview perspective of bacterial resistance.
AB  == the rapidly escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. this reduced susceptibility to currently available antimicrobial agents  coupled with the progressive shortage of newly approved compounds is a worrisome  situation. major problems are encountered for a growing number of gram-positive (i.e., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus spp.) and gram-negative pathogens (i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae). we provide an overview of bacterial resistance focusing on the most common pathogens responsible for infection in both the community and  healthcare settings. in addition, several strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance are also discussed. it is increasingly evident that without the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents, a return to the clinical outcomes associated with the pre-antibiotic era are inevitable.

TI  == a report from the 20th european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious  diseases (april 10-13, 2010 - vienna, austria).
AB  == effective antimicrobials currently in use in europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the european congress of  clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (eccmid). as extensively discussed  in an oral session entitled worldwide dissemination of resistances by 10 specialists from across europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (roede, b.m. et al., abst o127; huenger, f. et al., abst o395; mera, r.m. et al., abst o483). while many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals  and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (derde, l. et al., abst o464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the austria center in vienna. the war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. treatments of the diseases  caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by  new research and population surveys. however, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical profile of community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  == the aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. the patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (cap), as defined by british thoracic society, from  december 1998 to dec 2000, at the sher- i-kashmir institute of medical sciences soura, srinagar, india. gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). in 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by staphylococcus aureus (7/29), escherichia coli (6/29), klebsiella spp. (3/29), streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and acinetobacter  spp. (1/29). sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation  (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). the commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), copd (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, pseudomonas in two, klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. the factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of copd or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. the overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. this emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of cap.

TI  == an independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and sterilid.
AB  == aim: povidone iodine (pi) and sterilid (sl) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. we compared the antibacterial activity of pi and sl to determine the better antiseptic. methods: time-kill studies of pi and sl against a battery of bacteria that included staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. the comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. results: pi was more effective at a 90% kill than sl at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). pi was more effective at a 99.9% kill than sl at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). conclusions: our study supports pi as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. sl appears to be a less effective alternative.

TI  == [rapid and accurate detection of resistant bacteria for respiratory tract infection--present situation and future].
AB  == respiratory tract infection (rti) is a common and potentially life-threatening illness that continues to be a major medical problem. the rapid detection system  such as gram staining or urinary antigen detection for respiratory infection is useful. however, the genetic diagnosis for resistant pathogens has been expected  because they have been prevalent. we evaluated the rq-mpcr (real-time quantitative pcr combined with multiplex pcr) assay for drug resistant s. pneumonia infection. the rq-mpcr method developed here had high sensitivity and specificity for pneumococci and could detect drug resistance in both clinical s.  pneumoniae strains and in sputum samples. furthermore, the results can be obtained directly from clinical samples within 3h. this method may be helpful for the rapid screening of resistance in pneumococcal isolates, and should allow the  administration of earlier, more focused and effective treatment of drug-resistant s. pneumonia. we also established the rapid quantitative detection of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing p. aeruginosa in clinical isolates and samples using real-time pcr targeting gyrb (identification of p. aeruginosa) and blaimp (identification of metallo-beta-lactamase). the present pcr assay was thus easily and quickly performed, and accurately detected pseudomonas aeruginosa and metallo-beta-lactamase, and it should be helpful in the diagnosis and control of  nosocomial infection. we expect that the genetic diagnosis will be an adjunct to, or a replacement of, conventional culture methods and susceptibility tests.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, pvp-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  == background: this study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics pvp-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and  polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. methods: mics and mbcs were determined in accordance with din 58940-7 and 58940-8 using staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, haemophilus influenzae and candida albicans. the microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with din en 1040 and 1275 using s. aureus,  p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. results: for chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, mic(48) and mbc(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l. maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/l, with an efficacy gap against p. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of pvp-iodine were 1024 mg/l, with a gap against s. pneumoniae. comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. after 1 min, only octenidine and pvp-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. conclusions: tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. when a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine >  chlorhexidine > triclosan > pvp-iodine. this is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. if an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = pvp-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

TI  == study of the multidrug membrane transporter of single living pseudomonas aeruginosa cells using size-dependent plasmonic nanoparticle optical probes.
AB  == multidrug membrane transporters (efflux pumps) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are responsible for impossible treatments of a wide variety of diseases, including infections and cancer, underscoring the importance of better understanding of their structures and functions for the design of effective therapies. in this study, we designed and synthesized two silver nanoparticles (ag nps) with average diameters of 13.1 +/- 2.5 nm (8.1-38.6 nm) and 91.0 +/- 9.3 nm (56-120 nm) and used the size-dependent plasmonic spectra of single nps to probe the size-dependent transport kinetics of mexab-oprm (multidrug transporter) in pseudomonas aeruginosa in real time at nanometer resolution. we found that the level of accumulation of intracellular nps in wild-type (wt) cells was higher than in nalb1 (overexpression of mexab-oprm) but lower than in deltaabm (deletion of mexab-oprm). in the presence of proton ionophores (cccp, inhibitor of proton motive force), we found that intracellular nps in nalb1 were nearly doubled. these results suggest that mexab-oprm is responsible for the extrusion of nps out of cells and nps (orders of magnitude larger than conventional antibiotics) are the substrates of the transporter, which indicates that the substrates may trigger the assembly of the efflux pump optimized for the extrusion of the encountered substrates. we found that the smaller nps stayed inside the cells longer than larger nps, suggesting the size-dependent efflux kinetics of the cells. this study shows that multisized nps can be used to mimic various sizes of antibiotics for probing the size-dependent efflux kinetics of multidrug membrane  transporters in single living cells.

TI  == analysis of the crystal structure of the exsc.exse complex reveals distinctive binding interactions of the pseudomonas aeruginosa type iii secretion chaperone exsc with exse and exsd.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, like many gram-negative bacterial pathogens, requires its type iii secretion system (t3ss) to facilitate acute infections. in p. aeruginosa, the expression of all t3ss-related genes is regulated by the transcriptional activator exsa. a signaling cascade involving exsa and three additional proteins, exsc, exsd, and exse, directly ties the upregulation of exsa-mediated transcription to the activation of the type iii secretion apparatus. in order to characterize the events underlying the signaling process,  the crystal structure of the t3ss chaperone exsc in complex with its cognate effector exse has been determined. the structure reveals critical contacts that mediate the interactions between these two proteins. particularly striking is the presence of two arg-x-val-x-arg motifs in exse that form identical interactions along opposite sides of an exsc dimer. the structure also provides insights into  the interactions of exsc with the antiactivator protein exsd. it was shown that the amino-terminal 46 residues of exsd are sufficient for exsc binding. on the basis of these findings, a new model for the exsc.exsd complex is proposed to explain its distinctive 2:2 stoichiometry and why exsc displays a weaker affinity for exsd than for exse.

TI  == [immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  == introduction: alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. objectives: this study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. material and methods: sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the dr ladislao  de la pascua dermatology clinic between september 2008 and february 2009. the patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. in all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured.  results: a history of immunization (odds ratio [or], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6-6.7; p=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (or, 2.6; 95% ci, 1.1-6.2; p=.033), and being a carrier of streptococcus pyogenes (or, 2.1; 95% ci, 1.7-2.5; p=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. klebsiella pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. conclusions: this is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as  risk factors for development of the disease. given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == purpose: the pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of ceftobiprole are reviewed. summary: ceftobiprole, a novel, broad-spectrum, parenteral cephalosporin, inhibits the cell-wall synthesis of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) pbp2a and pbp2x, responsible for the resistance in staphylococci and pneumococci, respectively. ceftobiprole has good activity against gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes, and its activity against gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes is species dependent. ceftobiprole is relatively inactive against acinetobacter species. its ability to bind relevant pbps of resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria indicates its potential use in the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin-structure  infections (csssis). ceftobiprole is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys  and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. the half-life of the drug is approximately  3-4 hours. it exhibits minimal plasma protein binding (16%). ceftobiprole does not inhibit the cytochrome p-450 isoenzyme system, so the possibility of drug-drug interactions is low. the drug has not been approved for use in the united states but has been approved in canada and elsewhere. ceftobiprole is currently undergoing phase iii clinical trials and has demonstrated activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. completed phase iii trials  used i.v. dosages of 500 mg every 8-12 hours. the most commonly observed adverse  effects of ceftobiprole included headache and gastrointestinal upset. conclusion: ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum, parenteral cephalosporin undergoing phase iii clinical trials. its broad spectrum of activity makes it a candidate for monotherapy of csssis and pneumonias that have required combination therapy in the past.

TI  == [the role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  == exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of  life. approximately half of copd exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. current guidelines  recommend antibotic therapy in course of copd exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. the most common bacterial pathogens isolated in copd  exacerbation are haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. the presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. more virulent organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. atypical pathogens such chlamydophila and mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of copd exacerbation has been described in the article.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in india: role of multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (icu)-acquired infection. the aetiology of vap varies with different patient populations and types of icus. methodology: a prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in a tertiary care hospital to determine the various aetiological agents causing vap and the prevalence of multidrug resistant (mdr) pathogens. combination disk method, modified hodge test, edta disk synergy (eds) test and ampc disk test were performed for the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases (mbl) and ampc beta-lactamases respectively. results: enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, candida  spp. were more common in early-onset vap, while non-fermenters (pseudomonas spp.  and acinetobacter spp.) were significantly associated with late-onset vap (p value 0.0267, chi-square value 4.91). thirty-seven (78.7%) of the 47 vap pathogens were multidrug resistant. esbl was produced by 50% and 67% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. mbl was produced by 20%  of p. aeruginosa. ampc beta-lactamases were produced by 33.3% and 60.7% of the enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters respectively. of the s. aureus isolates, 43% were methicillin resistant. prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalization of five days or more were independent risk factors for vap by mdr pathogens. conclusions: vap is increasingly associated with mdr pathogens. production of esbl, ampc beta-lactamases and metallo beta-lactamases were responsible for the multi-drug resistance of these pathogens. increasing prevalence of mdr pathogens  in patients with late-onset vap indicate that appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat them.

TI  == the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis.
AB  == the syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) consists of chronic  bronchitis (cb), bronchiectasis, emphysema, and reversible airway disease that combine uniquely in an individual patient. older patients are at risk for copd and its components--emphysema, cb, and bronchiectasis. bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of copd (aecopd) and in acute exacerbations of cb (aecb) without features of copd. older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of aecopd and aecb. organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in aecopd/aecb such as haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis mycobacteria are more often seen in aecopd/aecb episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of cb or those with bronchiectasis. risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of aecopd and episodes of aecb. these guidelines have not been  prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of  antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during aecopd/aecb. second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment.

TI  == wound healing properties and kill kinetics of clerodendron splendens g. don, a ghanaian wound healing plant.
AB  == as part of our general objective of investigating indigenous plants used in wound healing in ghana, we hereby report our findings from some in vitro and in vivo studies related to wound healing activities of clerodendron splendens g. don (verbanaceae). methanolic extract of the aerial parts of the plant was tested for antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, as well as resistant strains of staph. aureus sa1199b, rn4220 and xu212), gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteous mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) and candida albicans using the micro-well dilution method. survivor-time studies of the microorganisms, radical scavenging activity using 2,2'-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (dpph) and various in vivo wound healing activity studies were also conducted on the extract. the extract exhibited biostatic action against all the test microorganisms with a minimum inhibition concentration (mic) ranging between 64 and 512 mug/ml and a free radical scavenging property with an ic(50) value of 103.2 mug/ml. the results of the in vivo wound healing tests showed that upon application of c. splendens ointment, there was a reduction in the epithelization period from 26.7 days (control) to 13.6 days along with a marked decrease in the scar area from 54.2 mm(2) (control) to 25.2 mm(2). significant increase in the tensile strength and hydroxyproline content were also observed as compared to the control and was comparable to nitrofurazone. the above results appear to justify the traditional use of c. splendens in wound healing and treatment of skin infections in ghana.

TI  == the pathogen of ventilator-associated pneumonia does not influence the mortality  rate of surgical intensive care unit patients treated with a rotational antibiotic system.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is one of the leading causes of morbidity in critically ill surgical patients. certain pathogens (e.g., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been associated with an excess mortality rate from sepsis in several studies, but not  in the surgical setting specifically or when protocol-driven antibiotic therapy is administered. purpose: we sought to determine which factors and, in particular, whether the individual pathogen affected the mortality rate in our surgical intensive care unit (icu), where a rotational antibiotic system has been employed continuously since 1997. we hypothesized that the type of pathogen and illness severity were the primary influences on the mortality rate of patients with vap. methods: a total of 198 consecutive patients from a university surgical icu, with clinical signs of vap confirmed by quantified isolation of significant  numbers of a pathogen (> or =10(4) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) from bronchoalveolar (bal) fluid obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, were identified  prospectively from january 2001 to november 2004. the data collected were age, sex, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) iii score, multiple  organ dysfunction score, unit day of diagnosis, time (h) to antibiotic administration (tta), appropriateness of initial therapy (ait), unit and hospital length of stay, and mortality rate. pathogens were classified as non-lactose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (ngnb), lactose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (lgnb), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, yeast, community-acquired pneumonia (e.g., streptococcus pneumoniae), or other pathogens. patients with a polymicrobial isolate were placed in the "other" category. results: the overall mortality rate  was 32.3% vs. 55% as predicted by apache iii normative data. the overall ait was  92%. the mortality rate for ngnb infections was 35.6% vs. 29.4% for lgnb infections (p = ns). by logistic regression, neither tta, ait, nor pathogen influenced the mortality rate. conclusions: the type of pathogen does not influence death in surgical icu patients with vap diagnosed rigorously and treated by a rotational antibiotic system. the high proportion of ait as a result of the rotational antibiotic administration system optimizes bacterial killing and negates the impact of bacterial resistance, contributing to better outcomes.

TI  == in vitro activities of doripenem and other carbapenems against clinically important bacteria isolated in intensive care units: nationwide data from the smart programme.
AB  == this nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan investigated the  susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from september through november 2005. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2005 guidelines. doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of mics) in vitro activity to meropenem for enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (nfgnbs), including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and burkholderia cepacia. among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates. however, the meropenem mic(90) against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. besides, doripenem with the mic(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. because of the heavy resistance burden in taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities  against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.

TI  == population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in japanese pediatric patients.
AB  == the aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for meropenem in japanese pediatric patients, and to use this model to assess the pharmacodynamics of meropenem regimens against common bacterial populations. pharmacokinetic data were pooled from nine separate studies (229 plasma samples and 61 urine samples from 40 infected children), modeled using the nonmem program, and used for a pharmacodynamic simulation to estimate the probabilities  of attaining the bactericidal target (40% of the time above the mic for the bacterium). in the final population pharmacokinetic model, body weight (bw, kg) was the most significant covariate: cl(r) (l/h) = 0.254 x bw, cl(nr) (l/h) = 3.45, v (c) (l) = 0.272 x bw, q (l/h) = 1.65, and v (p) (l) = 0.228 x bw, where cl(r) and cl(nr) are the renal and non-renal clearances, v (p) and v (c) are the  volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and q is the  intercompartmental (central-peripheral) clearance. in most typical patients (bw = 10, 20, and 30 kg), the approved regimens of 10-40 mg/kg, three times a day (0.5-h infusions), achieved a target attainment probability of >80% against escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. the results of this study provide a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in japanese pediatric patients.

TI  == pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of meropenem in japanese adult patients.
AB  == this study was a pharmacokinetic (pk)-pharmacodynamic (pd) target attainment analysis of meropenem in japanese adult patients. plasma drug concentration data  (265 samples from 42 patients) were used for population pk modeling and monte carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the pk-pd target (40% of  the time above the mic for the bacterium). the final population pk model identified creatinine clearance (cl(cr), ml/min) and body weight (bw, kg) as the  most significant covariates: cl (l/h) = 0.0905 x cl(cr) + 2.03, v(c)(l) = 0.199 9 bw, q (l/h) = 4.02, and v(p) (l) = 4.55, where cl is the clearance, vc and vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, respectively, and q is the intercompartmental clearance. the monte carlo simulation developed the pk-pd breakpoints (the highest mic values at which the probabilities of target attainment in plasma are 80% or more) for meropenem regimens, the values of which varied with the cl(cr) and bw of the patient. the simulation also demonstrated that 0.25 g every 12 h (0.5-h infusion) achieved a target attainment probability of 82.4-100% against escherichia coli, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 0.5 g every 8 h or 1 g every 8 h was required to achieve 80% or more probability in most typical patients. these results provide a pk-pd-based strategy for tailoring a meropenem regimen according to clcr and bw of a japanese adult patient and susceptibility of the causative bacteria.

(z)-5-(2,3,4-trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of s. aureus at 0.5 microg/ml and mrsa at 32 microg/ml. stronger antimicrobial activity against s. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. neither of the  compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for cefozopran in pediatric patients, and to use this model to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of cefozopran regimens against common bacterial populations. plasma drug concentration data (110 samples from 31 pediatric patients) were modeled using the nonmem program. the mean estimate and interindividual variance  of the model were used in a monte carlo simulation to estimate the probabilities  of attaining the bactericidal target for cefozopran (the time which the drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium is 70% of the dosing interval). a two-compartment model fitted the data and body weight (bw, kg) was the most significant covariate. the final model was: cl (l/h) = 0.674 x bw0.538, vc (l) = 0.00233 x bw2.25 + 1.85, q (l/h) = 1.46, and vp (l) = 0.0964 x bw, where cl is the clearance, vc, and vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and q is the intercompartmental clearance. the approved regimens of 20- or 40-mg/kg four times a day (0.5-h infusions), which were more effective than the corresponding three times a day-regimens, provided sufficient bactericidal effects on common bacterial populations (escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) in most typical patients. these results better define the pharmacokinetics of cefozopran and help in the choice of appropriate regimens for pediatric patients.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
AB  == the study group on antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from respiratory infections was established in 1981 in japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions.  examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin g in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp + prsp) reached almost 60% in 2001. the  proportion of prsp also increased, reaching 19.4%. thereafter, the rate of pisp + prsp decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with mics >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. among staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all s. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. in 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. for klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. the mic distribution patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher mics when compared with the mics for other pathogens. broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating p. aeruginosa infection. regarding moraxella catarrhalis,  beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.

AB  == although the mucoid form of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) is largely responsible for the progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (cf), the relationship between factors relating daily-care regimes to mucoidy acquisition are as yet poorly investigated. fifty-two cf patients registered at the cf centre of dijon,  france, were retrospectively evaluated from the date of pa colonization either to the first positive sputum culture for mucoid pa (n = 26) or to the last culture in which the pa remained non-mucoid (n = 26). all clinical, pathological and therapeutic events were recorded. the association between the parameters collected and mucoid transition of pa was assessed in a cox model with time-dependant covariables. the mean follow-up was 4.7 + or - 4.3 years. three independent parameters were associated with the higher risk of mucoid transition  of pa: persistence of pa in sputum (or 7.89; p <0.01), use of inhaled bronchodilators (or 3.40; p = 0.04), and the use of inhaled colimycin (or 4.04; p = 0.02). isolation of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae or streptococcus pneumoniae in sputum was associated with a lower risk (or 0.24; p < 0.01). mucoid transition of pa was associated with variables that reflected the severity of both lung disease and pa colonization. although they do not lead to prophylactic measures, these results corroborate the need to avoid pa persistence.

TI  == new antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  == the optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. we herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. the newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infections. tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections  caused by enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.

TI  == [update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  == there is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics  in clinical practice. as observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. for instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. in fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium). therefore, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for gram-positive infections. this review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in france (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).

TI  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: role of bacteria and updated guide to antibacterial selection in the older patient.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. copd is especially prevalent in the elderly, affecting 25% of those aged>or=75 years. the course of the disease in the elderly is often  complicated by co-morbid conditions, and its management is complicated by drug-drug interactions. exacerbations of copd increase rates of hospitalization and mortality and decrease quality of life. exacerbations are marked by an increase from baseline in dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence. approximately 50% of acute exacerbations of symptoms in copd are caused by non-typeable haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. stratification of exacerbations based on severity of symptoms and signs, and severity of underlying copd, is useful in selecting patients likely to benefit from antibacterial therapy. patients who are hospitalized with exacerbations, those who have all three symptoms (increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence), and those with severe underlying copd and exacerbations benefit most from antibacterials. antibacterial susceptibility patterns among the bacterial pathogens are evolving, and knowledge of local susceptibility patterns is useful in antibacterial selection. penicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and doxycycline should not be used as an initial antibacterial because of resistance  patterns. we recommend second-/third-generation cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin and respiratory fluoroquinolones as initial choices. in patients at risk of colonization by, and infection as a result of, p. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or an advanced penicillin/penicillinase combination effective against this species should be used. drug-drug interactions should be considered in antibacterial choice. the goals of antibacterial therapy for exacerbations of copd are the prevention of complications such as respiratory failure and death, and the reduction of treatment failures. the role of pathogenic bacteria in progression of stable copd and the use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable copd are under investigation. currently available evidence does not support routine clinical use of prophylactic antibacterials in stable copd. in conclusion, pathogenic bacteria cause a significant proportion of acute exacerbations of copd. use of antibacterials, based on current susceptibility patterns, is beneficial in patients with severe copd experiencing exacerbations and in patients with severe  exacerbations.

AB  == purpose: to study the microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis in northern  india and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial keratitis  isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. methods: laboratory records of all consecutive cases of clinically suspected bacterial corneal ulcers were retrospectively reviewed. data noted included microorganism isolated and antibiotic culture sensitivity to cefazolin, tobramycin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. in vitro susceptibility toward individual antibiotics was determined and compared with the potential in vitro susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin, cefazolin-gatifloxacin, and cefazolin-moxifloxacin combinations. results: a total of 292 bacterial isolates were identified. of these, 255 (87.3%) were gram-positive and 37 (12.7%) were gram-negative. staphylococcus epidermidis (n=227, 77.7%) was the most common organism. overall susceptibility of isolates was 95.52% to gatifloxacin, 92.83% to moxifloxacin, 90.07% to tobramycin, and 83.56% to cefazolin (p<0.000). organisms which showed resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones included staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. susceptibilities to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were comparable with each other (p=0.312) and with  potential susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin (p=0.479), gatifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.134), and moxifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.412) combinations. conclusions: monotherapy with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin can be an effective alternative to cefazolin-tobramycin combination as a first-line empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis. the addition of cefazolin to a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone is of limited value.

TI  == phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. in this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. one hundred and two  unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for ser/thr/tyr phosphorylations from 84 s. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of tio(2) enrichment and lc-ms/ms determination. the identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. a striking characteristic of s. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between april 2007 and march 2008].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2007 to march 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated.  among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, b. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by b. fragilis, bacteroides caccae and b. wadsworthia in this order. in  this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. there were nine strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci which show higher mic against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/ml, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-mrsa antibiotics. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == summary trends for the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program: a 10-year experience in the united states (1999-2008).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program  was a global, longitudinal antimicrobial resistance surveillance network of more  than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum comparator agents. in 1999, and from 2000 through 2008, a total of 10 or 15 united states (usa) medical centers each forwarded 200  nonduplicate clinical isolates from serious infections to a central processing laboratory. over the 10-year period of this surveillance program, the activity of meropenem and an average of 11 other antimicrobial agents were assessed against a total of 27 289 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute reference methods. meropenem consistently demonstrated low resistance rates against enterobacteriaceae species isolates through 2008 and did not exhibit a widespread change in resistance rates over the monitored interval. in fact, the incidence of emerging carbapenemase-producing (kpc-type) klebsiella spp. showed a decline in 2008 compared to the steeply increasing rates observed from 2004 to 2007. moreover, the kpc serine carbapenemases have spread to other enterobacteriaceae species monitored by the mystic program. greatest increases in antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) among all species monitored by the mystic program.  current susceptibility rates for meropenem when tested against prevalent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (439 strains, 85.4% susceptible), enterobacteriaceae (1537 strains, 97.3% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (460 strains, 100.0% susceptible), streptococcus pneumoniae (125 strains, 80.2% at meningitis susceptibility breakpoints), other streptococci (159 strains, 90.0-100.0% susceptible), and acinetobacter spp. (127 strains, 45.7% susceptible), the widest spectrum among beta-lactams tested in 2008 and throughout the last decade. continued local surveillance of broad-spectrum agents following the completion of the mystic program (usa) appears critical to detect emerging resistances among pathogens causing the most serious infections requiring carbapenem agents.

TI  == successful treatment of candida parapsilosis and pseudomonas aeruginosa infection using medical and surgical management in an injecting drug user with mitral and aortic valve endocarditis: a case report.
AB  == introduction: polymicrobial endocarditis is a well-recognized problem in intravenous drug users and it accounts for 1 to 3% of endocarditis cases overall  and up to 9% in other series. the most common combinations of organisms include staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae followed by staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. candida parapsilosis endocarditis carries a mortality rate of 45%, and each infection with candida or pseudomonas endocarditis per se carries a very high mortality rate approaching 85% and 80%, respectively. the combination of p. aeruginosa and c. parapsilosis has never been encountered and there have been no earlier reports of the combination of c. parapsilosis and p. aeruginosa in adult intravenous drug users as a cause of endocarditis. case presentation: we present a 49-year-old man with bivalvular endocarditis with p. aeruginosa and c. parapsilosis. he had a prior bivalvular replacement in 2005 that became infected with the above microorganisms and he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. because of ongoing intravenous drug use, a  second valve replacement was denied. a few days later, the patient presented with septic shock secondary to p. aeruginosa and c. parapsilosis recurrent endocarditis. the infection was cured with a second bivalvular replacement and extended therapy with antibiotics and antifungals. conclusion: this is the first  time a patient has presented with p. aeruginosa and c. parapsilosis endocarditis. relapsing polymicrobial endocarditis can be cured with medical and surgical therapy.

TI  == long-term daily high and low doses of azithromycin in children with cystic fibrosis: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background: long-term administration of azithromycin (azm) in children with cystic fibrosis (cf) has improved outcomes. however, the doses and schedule of administration are not very well studied in children with cf. methods: a randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effect of two doses of azithromycin (5mg/kg/day and 15mg/kg/day) on fev(1) and pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis. enrolled children were randomly allocated to receive daily azithromycin (5mg/kg/day or 15mg/kg/day) for 6months. clinical assessment and fev(1) measurement were performed monthly. results: 56 children (28 in high dose group and 28 in low dose group) were enrolled. 47 (24 and 23 children in low and high dose groups) completed 12months of follow up. there was  no difference in clinical scores, fev(1), pulmonary exacerbation rates between two groups at baseline, 6months and at 12months. per protocol analysis revealed that pulmonary exacerbation increased after discontinuing azm and there was significantly more increase after 12months of enrolment in children getting high  dose azithromycin. there was no improvement in fev(1) in either group at the end  of treatment period. children tolerated daily low as well as high dose azm well for 6months. there was no significant side effect of azithromycin. conclusion: in this randomized controlled trial, we did not find differences in the effect of 2  doses (5mg/kg/day or 15mg/kg/day) of azm on change in percentage predicted fev(1), clinical scores, pseudomonas colonization rates, pulmonary exacerbations  and need for antibiotics. there was increase in exacerbations after stopping azithromycin in both the groups. our results also suggest that the decrease in the incidence of lrti persists only till 6months after discontinuing azithromycin.

TI  == [bacteria and biofilm in respiratory tract infections].
AB  == biofilm is a structured community of bacterial cells included in a self-produced  polymeric matrix adherent to an inert or living surface. the main property of biofilm consists of making microrganisms more resistant to exogenous insults. antibiotic therapy typically resolves symptoms determined by planktonic cells released by biofilms but is not able to eradicate and completely clear biofilm. this is why infections sustained by biofilm-producer bacteria are often recurrent, making mandatory repeated antibiotic treatments. the typical conformation of biofilm, the phenotypical and genetical features existing among the different microrganisms confer a natural resistance to a number of antimicrobials so that it is necessary to test antimicrobial activity against the microbial species itself and also against biofilm, when it is present. comparative studies, performed on quinolones and beta-lactams, evidenced a significant activity against biofilm produced by pneumococci, haemophyli and pseudomonas as well.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia induce distinct host responses.
AB  == objective: pathogens that cause pneumonia may be treated in a targeted fashion by antibiotics, but if this therapy fails, then treatment involves only nonspecific  supportive measures, independent of the inciting infection. the purpose of this study was to determine whether host response is similar after disparate infections with similar mortalities. design: prospective, randomized controlled study. setting: animal laboratory in a university medical center. interventions:  pneumonia was induced in fvb/n mice by either streptococcus pneumoniae or two different concentrations of pseudomonas aeruginosa. plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from septic animals was assayed by a microarray immunoassay measuring 18 inflammatory mediators at multiple time points. measurements and main results: the host response was dependent on the causative organism as well as kinetics of mortality, but the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses were independent of inoculum concentration or degree of bacteremia. pneumonia caused by different concentrations of the same bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, also yielded distinct inflammatory responses; however, inflammatory mediator expression did not directly track the severity of infection. for all infections, the host response was compartmentalized, with markedly different concentrations of inflammatory mediators in the systemic circulation and the lungs. hierarchical clustering analysis resulted in the identification of five distinct clusters of the host response to bacterial infection. principal components analysis correlated pulmonary macrophage inflammatory peptide-2 and interleukin-10 with progression of infection, whereas elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor sr2 and macrophage chemotactic peptide-1 were indicative of fulminant disease with >90% mortality within 48 hrs. conclusions: septic mice have distinct local and systemic responses to streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. targeting specific host inflammatory responses  induced by distinct bacterial infections could represent a potential therapeutic  approach in the treatment of sepsis.

TI  == description of streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  == background: longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and staphylococcus aureus. although streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. methods: we performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for s. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from march 2003 through june 2008. results: of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). this group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to s. pneumoniae. conclusions: pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making  it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the  burn population. it should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.

TI  == the clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == the continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat  serious infections. the major success of the seven-valent streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. the almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of ctx-m beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the  united states, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanni, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.

TI  == antibacterial properties of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive: does the polymerization reaction play a role?
AB  == purpose: to ascertain if the polymerization reaction also contributes additionally to the antibacterial effects of two commonly used cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives. materials and methods: fresh liquid ethyl-cyanoacrylate (ec) and n-butyl-cyanoacrylate (bc) adhesives were applied onto 6-mm sterile filter paper discs. in the first group, the adhesive-soaked discs were immediately placed onto confluent monolayer cultures of bacteria, allowing the polymerization reaction to proceed while in culture. in the second group, the adhesive-soaked disc was allowed to first polymerize prior to being placed onto the bacterial cultures. four types of bacteria were studied: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immediately after the discs were applied, the cultures were incubated at 35 degrees c for 24 h. bacterial inhibitory halos were measured in the cultures at the end of the incubation period. results: for ec, exposure of the bacteria to the cyanoacrylate polymerization reaction increased the bacterial inhibitory halos in streptococcus pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. for bc, it increased the bacterial inhibitory halos in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. no inhibitory halos were observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the bactericidal effect was higher in actively polymerizing ec, compared to previously polymerized ec in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and escherichia coli; however, no such differences were observed for  bc. conclusions: the polymerization reaction may also be an important factor in the antibacterial properties of ec and bc.

TI  == 10 years' experience with the pneumococcal quinolone moxifloxacin.
AB  == moxifloxacin (mxf) is the latest broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone marketed worldwide. it has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens including anaerobes and intracellular organisms, as well  as strains resistant to beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics. for relevant respiratory pathogens, mxf attains the threshold values of pharmacodynamic indices predictive of clinical efficacy and minimization of resistance development. on the other hand, due to its limited activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, it is less suitable for 'late-onset' nosocomial infections. in clinical trials, it has been found to be at least as effective and safe as comparators, while often showing higher bacteriological success rates. in some randomized studies mxf has shown superiority over comparator regimens in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. a consistent observation in many clinical trials of respiratory tract infections is the early onset of effect and a faster  resolution of symptoms compared with standard therapy, possibly resulting from its fast distribution into tissue and high bactericidal activity leading to more  rapid bacterial eradication. although originally developed for respiratory tract  infections, mxf over the years as been shown to be effective, and consequently received approval for additional indications.

TI  == synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(ii) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (osn2) schiff base ligands.
AB  == cobalt ion complexes with the schiff bases, (4-x-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (x=methoxy (ome), phenylazo (n(2)ph), bromo (br), nitro (no(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (c, h, n), ftir, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. the thermal stability of free ligands  and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) and thermogravimetric analyses (tga). cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. the synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four gram-positive bacteria: streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus anthracis  and also against the two gram-negative bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity data show that the parent schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.

TI  == factor analysis of microbiological activity data and structural parameters of antibacterial quinolones.
AB  == factor analysis (fa) was performed on quinolone derivatives with antibacterial activity to model relationships between molecular descriptors and microbiological activities determined on five bacterial cell lines (escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae). molecular modeling studies were performed with the use of hyperchem  software and mm+ molecular mechanics with the semi-empirical am1 method. factor analysis led to the extraction of two main factors, with the share of factor 1 amounting to about 76% and factor 2 to about 24% for all the parameters used in the statistical analysis. moreover, fa results indicated that energy of orbitals  lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, energy of ionization, electron affinity, electronegativity, maximum electron density, refraction and polarizability appeared to be descriptors important for the antibacterial activity of quinolones.

TI  == human alpha-defensins inhibit hemolysis mediated by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria release exotoxins that belong to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. here, we report that human alpha-defensins hnp-1 to hnp-3 acted in a concentration-dependent manner to protect human red blood cells from the lytic effects of three of these exotoxins: anthrolysin o (alo), listeriolysin o, and pneumolysin. hd-5 was very effective against listeriolysin o but less effective against the other toxins. human alpha-defensins hnp-4 and hd-6 and human beta-defensin-1, -2, and -3 lacked protective ability. hnp-1 required intact disulfide bonds to prevent toxin-mediated hemolysis. a fully linearized analog, in which all six cysteines were replaced by aminobutyric acid (abu) residues, showed greatly reduced binding and protection. a partially unfolded hnp-1 analog, in which only cysteines 9 and  29 were replaced by abu residues, showed intact alo binding but was 10-fold less  potent in preventing hemolysis. surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that hnp-1 to hnp-3 bound all three toxins at multiple sites and also that solution-phase hnp molecules could bind immobilized hnp molecules. defensin concentrations that inhibited hemolysis by alo and listeriolysin did not prevent  these toxins from binding either to red blood cells or to cholesterol. others have shown that hnp-1 to hnp-3 inhibit lethal toxin of bacillus anthracis, toxin  b of clostridium difficile, diphtheria toxin, and exotoxin a of pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, this is the first time these defensins have been shown to inhibit pore-forming toxins. an "abcde mechanism" that can account for the ability of hnp-1 to hnp-3 to inhibit so many different exotoxins is proposed.

TI  == the nana neuraminidase of streptococcus pneumoniae is involved in biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of bacteremia, pneumonia, and otitis media despite vaccines and effective antibiotics. the neuraminidase of s.  pneumoniae, which catalyzes the release of terminal sialic acid residues from glycoconjugates, is involved in host colonization in animal models of infection and may provide a novel target for preventing pneumococcal infection. we demonstrate that the s. pneumoniae neuraminidase (nana) cleaves sialic acid and show that it is involved in biofilm formation, suggesting an additional role in pathogenesis, and that it shares this property with the neuraminidase of pseudomonas aeruginosa even though we show that the two enzymes are phylogenetically divergent. using an in vitro model of biofilm formation incorporating human airway epithelial cells, we demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors of nana block biofilm formation and may provide a novel target for preventative therapy. this work highlights the role played by the neuraminidase in pathogenesis and represents an important step in drug development for prevention of colonization of the respiratory tract by this important pathogen.

TI  == dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the indian scenario.
AB  == background: we studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. findings: a total of 115 (104 daily  wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were  the samples collected. the isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users  who used their lenses for less than 2 years. lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. the bacteria isolated were citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. conclusion: non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. the accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. the bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.

AB  == biapenem has been used in pediatric patients as well as adult patients; however,  little information is available on dosing regimens for pediatric patients. this study examined biapenem pharmacokinetics in pediatric population and performed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis. biapenem plasma concentrations from 10  pediatric patients were pharmacokinetically analyzed. a multi-regression analysis showed the pharmacokinetic parameters were affected by body weight and creatinine clearance of the patients. using the pharmacokinetic parameters, a monte carlo simulation predicted the probabilities of attaining the pharmacodynamic target (40% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). in the case of about 20 kg, biapenem regimens of 5 mg/kg b.i.d. and 10 mg/kg b.i.d. provided sufficient target attainment probabilities against streptococcus  pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, respectively. our results should  provide a pk-pd-based guidance for rationalizing biapenem regimen according to the body weight and renal function of a pediatric patient and the specific bacterium suspected.

TI  == evolving concepts in biofilm infections.
AB  == several pathogens associated with chronic infections, including pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae in chronic otitis media, staphylococcus aureus in chronic rhinosinusitis and enteropathogenic escherichia coli in recurrent urinary tract infections, are linked to biofilm formation. biofilms are usually defined as surface-associated microbial communities, surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance (eps) matrix. biofilm formation has been demonstrated for numerous pathogens and is clearly an important microbial survival strategy. however, outside of dental plaques, fewer reports have investigated biofilm development in clinical samples. typically biofilms are found in chronic diseases that resist host immune responses and antibiotic treatment and these characteristics are often cited for the ability of bacteria to persist in vivo. this review examines some recent attempts to examine the biofilm phenotype in vivo and discusses the challenges and implications for defining a biofilm phenotype.

AB  == the choice of empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive-care unit (icu) used to rely on the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. data from  308 icus from the german national nosocomial infection surveillance system, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the icu. the frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. a total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the cdc criteria had been modified. from 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus (2,718  cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant s. aureus), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), escherichia coli (1,137 cases), enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671  cases), haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). the order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: s. aureus was first, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli. thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. this classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups.

TI  == crystal structures of respiratory pathogen neuraminidases.
AB  == currently there is pressing need to develop novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of infections by the human respiratory pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae. the neuraminidases of these pathogens are important for host colonization in animal models of infection and are attractive targets for drug discovery. to aid in the development of inhibitors against these neuraminidases, we have determined the crystal structures of the p. aeruginosa enzyme nanps and s. pneumoniae enzyme nana at 1.6 and 1.7a resolution, respectively. in situ proteolysis with trypsin was essential for the crystallization of our recombinant nana. the active site regions of the two enzymes are strikingly different. nana contains a deep pocket that is similar to  that in canonical neuraminidases, while the nanps active site is much more open.  the comparative studies suggest that nanps may not be a classical neuraminidase,  and may have distinct natural substrates and physiological functions. this work represents an important step in the development of drugs to prevent respiratory tract colonization by these two pathogens.

AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

AB  == objective: bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. the objective of this study was to explore application of the combined  detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. methods: totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. the age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by  streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. the aspirate samples were also amplified for dna of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (tem-pcr) and detected with luminex xmap technology platform. results: the total positive rate  by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were hemophilus  influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187)  were acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. the total positive rate by combined detection of culture and tem-pcr assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. conclusion: the tem-pcr assay may increase the detection rate of hemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. the tem-pcr needs further improvement for diagnosis of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [clinical characteristics of primary ciliary dyskinesia in children].
AB  == objective: although primary ciliary dyskinesia (pcd) is a group of inherited diseases, accurate diagnosis and appropriate clinical care to prevent and treat the complications could maintain patients' quality of life and normal life span.  the diagnosis of pcd may often be delayed because it is frequently misdiagnosed as bronchitis, sinusitis and otitis. this study aimed to analyze and summarize the clinical features of pcd and explore diagnostic and differential diagnostic procedures in children. methods: patients were all chosen from the inpatient department of beijing children's hospital, capital medical university between 1990 - 2006. the tunica mucosa bronchiorum and/or nasal mucous membrane were gained through bronchoscope in children suspected to have pcd. the ciliary ultrastructures were analyzed through the electron microscope. the clinical features and procedures of the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in children with pcd were analyzed. results: there were totally 26 children diagnosed as pcd  with 10 (38.5%) kartagener syndrome. all kartagener syndrome children had mirror  image dextrocardia with normal cardiac structure and situs inversus viscerum. the bronchoscopy performed in eight of 10 kartagener syndrome children showed bronchus transposition. twenty-six children came from twenty-five families. although the siblings of four probands also had the symptoms of chronic cough with sputum, running nose and recurrent respiratory infections, only a boy and his sister were diagnosed as kartagener syndrome simultaneously. their parents and the other family members were healthy. of the 26 patients, 11 were boys and 15 were girls. the median age at diagnosis was 8.7 years. the age of onset was between the second day after delivery and fifteen years old, median age was 3 years. the course of disease before diagnosis was eleven days to twelve years (median 3.5 years). all the children had the symptom of cough, 24 of which had productive cough. seven cases were found to have clubbing fingers. dynein arm defect was found in 10 children, 6 of them had total absence of dynein arms and 4 had decreased dynein arm numbers. microtube derangements were found in 8 children. one kartagener syndrome child had a normal cilia structure. bronchiectasis, consolidation and increased lung markings were found in 8, 6 and  7 patients separately on the radiographic study. twenty patients had sinusitis. nine of sixteen children had decreased pef, fev1 and/or fef 25 - 75 on the pulmonary function test. fifteen culture samples obtained from 6 children's sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were positive for 8 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and 2 strains of candida albicans. in 1 subject more than one organism were found in the same sample. hearing lost and gastroesophageal reflux were detected in 3 of 4 and 3 of 5 examined children respectively. conclusions: the onset of pcd can occur from neonate to adolescence and usually has a chronic course. the common symptom of pediatric pcd was productive cough and significant growth retardation. the most common ultrastructural abnormalities associated with pcd were the total absence of dynein arms, decreased dynein arm numbers and microtube derangement. some patients have normal ciliary structures. bronchiectasis, consolidation and sinusitis were usually seen on the radiography. pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae were the two common bacterial organisms obtained from sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pcd children. some patients have mixed infections. pcd children have high percentages of hearing lost and gastroesophageal reflux.

TI  == antibacterial activity of preservative-free topical anesthetic drops in current use in ophthalmology departments.
AB  == aim: the antibacterial effect of topical anesthetics may lead to false-negative cultures from corneal specimens of bacterial keratitis. this in vitro study compared the antibacterial effect of 3 unpreserved topical anesthetics to indicate the most appropriate agent for corneal scrapes. methods: four bacterial  strains (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae) derived from the most frequently isolated microorganisms from corneal ulcers were cultured from stored control stocks and clinical specimens. these strains were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 3 preservative-free anesthetic eyedrops: proxymetacaine 0.5%, oxybuprocaine 0.4%, and tetracaine 1%. results: there was no inhibition of growth seen with proxymetacaine 0.5% (5000 microg/ml) with any of the organisms except s. epidermidis, which demonstrated an mic of 2500 microg/ml  (equivalent to a dilution of (1/2)). tetracaine 1% (10,000 microg/ml) produced an mic ranging between 625 and 1250 microg/ml, inhibiting all 4 strains at the commercially available dilution. oxybuprocaine 0.4% (4000 microg/ml) resulted to  be the second most inhibitory preparation with an mic ranging between 1000 and 2000 microg/ml. conclusions: currently used preservative-free topical anesthetics differ in bacterial growth inhibition. this in vitro study showed that proxymetacaine 0.5% is the least inhibitory on bacterial growth and therefore the most appropriate to be used before corneal scrapes.

TI  == major age group-specific differences in conjunctival bacteria and evolution of antimicrobial resistance revealed by laboratory data surveillance.
AB  == purpose: we hypothesized that observation and analysis of microbiological laboratory statistics from patients with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis should increase our understanding of microbiological epidemiology of the disease  in age categories. we further assumed that the statistical data should expose evolution of antimicrobial resistance that may eventually have an influence on clinical decisions. materials and methods: we analyzed statistical data of bacterial isolates (1139 strains) and their resistance to common antibiotics from 2494 patients with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis. results: streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus displayed their presence in 0- to 5-year-old children. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common in the elderly (>age 70) among whom a rapid increase in resistance of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin (mrsa) was recognized. conclusions: our study demonstrates that the spectrum of conjunctival bacteria varies among age groups. in addition, our results confirm that a shift in antimicrobial susceptibility can be rapid and age-group specific, thus emphasizing the need for continuous surveillance of bacterial findings.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == capsule polysaccharide is a bacterial decoy for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (aps) are important host weapons against infections. nearly all aps are cationic and their microbicidal action is initiated through interactions with the anionic bacterial surface. it is known that pathogens have  developed countermeasures to resist these agents by reducing the negative charge  of membranes, by active efflux and by proteolytic degradation. here we uncover a  new strategy of resistance based on the neutralization of the bactericidal activity of aps by anionic bacterial capsule polysaccharide (cps). purified cpss  from klebsiella pneumoniae k2, streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 and pseudomonas aeruginosa increased the resistance to polymyxin b of an unencapsulated k. pneumoniae mutant. furthermore, these cpss increased the mics of polymyxin b and human neutrophil alpha-defensin 1 (hnp-1) for unencapsulated k. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa pao1. polymyxin b or hnp-1 released cps from capsulated k. pneumoniae, s. pneumoniae serotype 3 and p. aeruginosa overexpressing cps. moreover, this material also reduced the bactericidal activity of aps. we postulate that aps may trigger in vivo the release of cps, which in turn will protect bacteria against aps. we found that anionic cpss, but not cationic or uncharged ones, blocked the bactericidal activity of aps by binding them, thereby reducing the amount of peptides reaching the bacterial surface. supporting this, polycations inhibited such interaction and the bactericidal activity was restored. we postulate that trapping of aps by  anionic cpss is an additional selective virulence trait of these molecules, which could be considered as bacterial decoys for aps.

TI  == the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal fluid of neurosurgical patients.
AB  == this study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid (csf). meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h) was administered by 0.5-h  infusion to six neurosurgical patients. lumbar csf and venous blood samples were  obtained at 0.5-16 h after the start of the first infusion. drug concentrations in the csf and plasma were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a monte carlo simulation with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data of clinical isolates in japan. meropenem penetrated into the csf with the area under the drug concentration-time curve ratio of 0.10 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- sd) and the repeated infusions caused the drug concentration in the csf to accumulate slightly. against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and escherichia coli isolates, 0.5 g q8h achieved a >90% probability of pharmacodynamic target (50% of the time above mic) attainment, and 1 g q8h was needed for a >90% probability of target (100% of the time above mic) attainment.  however, against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 g q8h achieved a lower probability of  target attainment. these results should help us to better elucidate the pharmacokinetics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal space while also helping us to choose the appropriate drug dosages for the management of bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  == we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan  to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey  (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of  respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and  imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing  results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2005)].
AB  == from october 2005 to september 2006, we collected the specimen from 366 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 411 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 406 strains were examined. the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 70,  streptococcus pneumoniae 85, haemophilus influenzae 78, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 46, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, klebsiella pneumoniae 21, and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 40. of 70 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus:  mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 38 (54.3%) and 32 (45.7%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of 37 strains (97.4%) at 0.063 microg/ml or less. against mrsa, arbekacin and vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (38.1%) and clindamycin (22.6%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its mic90 was 0.063  microg/ml or less. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its mic90 was 0.5 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), arbekacin had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 8 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (53.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection  were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 44.3% and 29.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria  frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (15.4%), s. pneumoniae (23.4%), and h. influenzae (21.3%). s. aureus (25.4%) and  s. pneumoniae (18.0%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (22.0%) and h. influenzae (21.4%).  the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, and their isolation frequencies were each 35.3%.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == bacteria possessing two rela/spot-like proteins have evolved a specific stringent response involving the acyl carrier protein-spot interaction.
AB  == bacteria respond to nutritional stress by producing (p)ppgpp, which triggers a stringent response resulting in growth arrest and expression of resistance genes. in escherichia coli, rela produces (p)ppgpp upon amino acid starvation by detecting stalled ribosomes. the spot enzyme responds to various other types of starvation by unknown mechanisms. we previously described an interaction between  spot and the central cofactor of lipid synthesis, acyl carrier protein (acp), which is involved in detecting starvation signals in lipid metabolism and triggering spot-dependent (p)ppgpp accumulation. however, most bacteria possess a unique protein homologous to rela/spot (rsh) that is able to synthesize and degrade (p)ppgpp and is therefore more closely related to spot function. in this  study, we asked if the acp-spot interaction is specific for bacteria containing two rela and spot enzymes or if it is a general feature that is conserved in rsh  enzymes. by testing various combinations of spot, rela, and rsh enzymes and acps  of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus pneumoniae, we found that the interaction between (p)ppgpp synthases and acp seemed to be restricted to spot proteins of bacteria containing the two rela and  spot proteins and to acp proteins encoded by genes located in fatty acid synthesis operons. when rsh enzymes from b. subtilis and s. pneumoniae are produced in e. coli, the behavior of these enzymes is different from the behavior of both rela and spot proteins with respect to (p)ppgpp synthesis. this suggests  that bacteria have evolved several different modes of (p)ppgpp regulation in order to respond to nutrient starvation.

TI  == characterization of guanylate kinase from gram positive and gram negative microorganisms; preliminary results.
AB  == guanylate kinase is a member of the nucleoside monophosphate (nmp) kinase family, a family of enzymes that despite having a low primary structure identity share a  similar fold, which consists of three structurally distinct regions termed the core, lid, and nmp-binding regions. guanylate kinase (gmpk) is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of gtp and dgtp by catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer from atp to (d)gmp resulting in adp and (d)gdp. despite the similar fold of the monomer there is an important difference between gmpks from prokaryotes and eukaryotes: eukaryotes gmpk are monomers while prokaryotes gmpk are dimmers, tetramers or hexamers. for this reason bacterial gmpks are possible targets for new antibacterial drugs. finding new targets for antibacterial therapies is a prior subject in today's medical research. the purpose of this work was to characterize guanylate kinases from both gram positive and gram negative pathogenic bacteria. we started with gmpk from enterococcus faecalis as gram positive microorganism and pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram negative representative.

TI  == long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment reduces the incidence but increases macrolide resistance in staphylococcus aureus in danish cf patients.
AB  == background: since 2001, long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment has been used  for cf patients chronically infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa in the copenhagen cf centre. our study investigates changes in incidence of colonization with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis and changes in macrolide sensitivity in these microorganisms during azithromycin treatment. methods: cf patients treated continuously with azithromycin for at least 3 months were included. results of microbiological examination, including phage typing results of s. aureus, obtained during treatment were compared to results obtained 2 years before treatment. results: 70 patients (median age 29.1 years) treated for a median of 4 years (range 0.7-5.1) were included. before treatment, 44 patients had at least one culture positive for s. aureus compared to 25 patients during treatment (p<0.01). mean percentage of sputum samples with growth of s. aureus decreased from 12.1% (range 0-82.6%) before treatment to 6.1% (range 0-93.2) during treatment (p<0.0006). prevalence's of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae also decreased significantly. fifteen of 214 isolates (7%) of s. aureus were macrolide resistant before treatment, increasing to 95 of 181 isolates (52.5%) during treatment (p<0.001). macrolide resistant strains were found in 3 of 44 s. aureus  colonized patients before treatment and in 11 of 25 patients at some time during  treatment (p<0.03), all belonging to different phage types. first resistant s. aureus isolate was isolated after a median treatment duration of 1.5 years (range 0.3-2.9). no mrsa were isolated. only 1 macrolide resistant isolate of m. catarrhalis was found during treatment. no macrolide resistance was found in h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae. conclusion: long-term, low-dose treatment with azithromycin in cf patients leads to reduced prevalence of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae, but increased macrolide resistance in s. aureus. reduction in the prevalence of s. aureus will make increasing macrolide resistance clinically insignificant in these patients.

TI  == clinical implications of antimicrobial resistance for therapy.
AB  == the last decade has seen a significant improvement in published evidence to show  the clinical predictive value of phenotypic susceptibility testing with categorization of pathogens as 'susceptible' or 'resistant' based on clinical breakpoints. most of the published data are based on retrospective or prospective observational clinical studies of patients treated with appropriate [pathogen(s)-susceptible] or inappropriate [pathogen(s)-resistant] chemotherapy.  appropriate therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in infections occurring in hospitals, such as bloodstream infection (bsi) and pneumonia in the intensive care unit. infections due to specific pathogens such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus also respond better to appropriate than inappropriate antibiotics. the situation with vancomycin-resistant enterococci is less clear, perhaps due to the increased importance of patient confounders. streptococcus pneumoniae when causing acute pneumonia with or without bsi is a well-known exception to the predictive value of laboratory-defined resistance. antibiotic resistance also impacts on outcomes in the community where the evidence is best for urinary tract infection. the clinical studies are compatible with the current pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic paradigm used to explain and predict antibacterial effects and therefore have a sound basis in antimicrobial science.  these data underline the importance of well-constructed epidemiological studies to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in clinical practice and  the central place of laboratory-based susceptibility testing in dictating antimicrobial therapy and so optimizing patient outcomes.

TI  == in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of tomopenem (cs-023), a novel carbapenem,  against pseudomonas aeruginosa in a murine chronic respiratory tract infection model.
AB  == objectives: tomopenem (cs-023) is a novel parenteral carbapenem with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, as well as  potent activity against drug-resistant pathogens, including penicillin-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we compared the in vivo activity of tomopenem and that of meropenem in a chronic lower respiratory infection mouse model of p. aeruginosa.  methods: mice with chronic airway infection by p. aeruginosa were treated with saline (as the control, twice daily), tomopenem (100 mg/kg, twice daily) or meropenem (100 mg/kg, twice daily) for 7 days. after treatment, the number of viable bacteria in lungs and histopathological findings were analysed. the pharmacokinetics of tomopenem and meropenem were also analysed after initial treatment. results: the number of viable bacteria in lungs treated with saline, tomopenem or meropenem was 4.21 +/- 1.28, 2.91 +/- 0.87 and 3.01 +/- 1.00 log(10) cfu/lung (mean +/- sem), respectively (p < 0.05, control versus tomopenem- or meropenem-treated groups). in the histopathological examination of lung specimens, the control group had the features of chronic bronchial infection; however, tomopenem- and meropenem-treated groups had fewer inflammatory cells compared with the control group. the pharmacokinetic parameter of % time above mic for tomopenem and meropenem was 16% and 17% in sera and 15% and 18% in lungs, respectively. conclusions: tomopenem significantly reduced the number of viable bacteria in a murine model of chronic airway infection by p. aeruginosa, compared with the control. considering the longer half-life of tomopenem in humans compared with most other carbapenems, tomopenem treatment of chronic airway infection with p. aeruginosa is expected to be efficacious.

TI  == [activity of tigecycline against pathogen bacteria isolated in respiratory infectious disease in europe. test study 2004-2007].
AB  == tigecycline (tgc), a semisynthetic glycylcycline, has a documented activity on gram+ and gram- pathogens including oxacillin-resistant (mrsa) and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is an international surveillance study designed to assess the in vitro activity of tgc and 11 comparators against a range of important clinical pathogens from both the community and the hospital. the aim of this study was to assess efficacy of tgc, using this database, against pathogens implicated in community or hospital pneumonia and sinusitis. a total of 4163 isolates were consecutively collected in 21 european countries during three  years (2004-2007). in all center, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determinated with the same microscan panel (dade-behring). tigecycline exhibited  a good activity against respiratory pathogens, with the exception of pseudomonas  aeruginosa. hundred percent of cocci gram+ (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus sp.) and 100% of haemophilus sp. are inhibited with 0.5 mg/l, without effect of an associated beta-lactam resistance mechanism. tgc is active in vitro on 89% of enterobacteriaceae, with mic 90 less  or equal to 2mg/l. eighty-nine percent of enterobacter sp. and 77% of serratia sp. are susceptible with range of mic 90 from 2 to 4 mg/l. these interesting results obtained in vitro are to be strengthened by clinical studies.

TI  == sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin hydrate (du-6859a, gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and acinetobacter baumannii. the in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. in a published phase ii randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). results of the phase iii trials of sitafloxacin are not available in english. the clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. the most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders  (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. for japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. while it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.

TI  == epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults: a population-based  study.
AB  == objective: this study assessed incidence, aetiology, clinical outcomes and risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in older adults. methods: this was a population-based cohort study that included 11,241 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 years or more, who were followed between 2002 and 2005 in the region of tarragona, spain. primary endpoints were all-cause cap (hospitalised and outpatient) and 30-day mortality after the diagnosis. all cases were radiographically proved and validated by checking clinical records. results: incidence rate of overall cap was 14 cases per 1000 person-years (10.5 and 3.5 for hospitalised and outpatient cases, respectively). incidence was almost three-fold higher among immunocompromised patients (30.9 per 1000) than among immunocompetent subjects (11.6 per 1000). maximum incidences were observed among  patients with chronic lung disease and long-term corticosteroid therapy (46.5 and 40.1 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively). overall 30-day case-fatality rate was 12.7% (2% in cases managed as outpatient and 15% in hospitalised patients). among 358 patients with an aetiological work-up, a total of 142 pathogens were found (single pathogen in 121 cases and mixed pathogens in 10 cases). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (49%), followed by  pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), chlamydia pneumoniae (9%) and haemophilus influenzae (6%). in multivariable analysis, the variables most strongly associated with increasing risk of cap were history of hospitalisation for cap in the previous 2 years and presence of any chronic lung disease. conclusions: cap remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. incidence rates in this study largely doubled prior rates reported in southern european regions.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI  == empiric treatment with once-daily cefonicid and gentamicin for febrile non-neutropenic pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters.
AB  == summary: the approach to treating febrile non-neutropenic hematooncologic patients with central venous catheters varies. we recently introduced once-daily  administration of cefonicid and gentamicin for such children who were in good clinical condition and without focal signs of infection. our 2-year experience of 125 episodes in 54 children is hereby reported. absolute neutrophil counts were 550 to 16,700/mm. bacteremia occurred in 6.4% episodes: only in patients with hickman/broviac catheters and not in those with port-a-caths [8/37 (21.6%) vs. 0/17 patients, p=0.046; 8/86 (9.3%) vs. 0/39 episodes, p=0.056]. the pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (3), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae (1), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (1), and streptococcus milleri (1). all patients remained in stable clinical condition and all, except for 2 who became neutropenic and 1 with s. aureus bacteremia who developed cellulitis, defervesced while on the empiric therapy. three episodes could not be managed as outpatients. no adverse effects were observed. we conclude that our approach is efficacious and safe and, furthermore, that empiric antibiotic therapy may not be indicated for selected patients with port-a-caths. future study of children with hickman/broviac catheters will evaluate the use of cefonicid alone.

TI  == safety of bronchoalveolar lavage in young children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objective: our aim was to determine the safety of bal in young children <6 years  with cf. methods: as part of a multi-center study of bal-directed therapy, children with cf < 6 years had one or more bals between september 1999 and december 2005. adverse events were recorded intraoperatively and for 24 hr thereafter. clinical characteristics before bal, findings at bronchoscopy and bal results were assessed as risk factors for adverse events. results: 333 bals were  conducted in 107 (56 males) children, median age 23.5 (range 1.6-67.5) months, including 170 (51%) for pulmonary exacerbation. 29 bals (8.7%) were followed by fever >or=38.5 degrees c and 10 (3%) had clinically significant episodes (five intraoperative hemoglobin desaturations to <90% requiring intervention, one tachyarrhythmia, two needing post-operative supplemental oxygen, one hospitalization for stridor). two contaminated bronchoscopes were detected. 180 minor adverse events were recorded in 174 (52%) bal procedures (137 altered cough, 41 fever <38.5 degrees c). low percentage bal return (p = 0.002) and focal bronchitis (p = 0.02) were associated with clinically significant deterioration.  multivariable analysis identified streptococcus pneumoniae (or 22.3; 95% confidence interval (ci); 6.9,72), pseudomonas aeruginosa (or 2.4; 95% ci 1.0, 5.8), respiratory signs (or 5.0; 95% ci 1.7, 14.6) and focal bronchitis (or 5.9;  95% ci 1.2, 29.8) as independent risk factors for post-bronchoscopy fever >or=38.5 degrees c. conclusions: adverse events are common with bal in young cf children, but are usually transient and well tolerated. parents should be counseled that signs of a pre-existing lower respiratory infection are associated with increased risk of post-bal fever.

TI  == in vitro activity of doripenem, a carbapenem for the treatment of challenging infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, against recent clinical isolates from the united states.
AB  == doripenem, a 1beta-methylcarbapenem, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic approved for  the treatment of complicated urinary tract and complicated intra-abdominal infections. an indication for hospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia is pending. the current study examined the activity of doripenem against recent clinical isolates for the purposes of its ongoing clinical development and future longitudinal analysis. doripenem and comparators were tested against 12,581 u.s. clinical isolates collected between 2005 and 2006 including isolates of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. mics (microg/ml) were established by broth microdilution. by mic(90), doripenem was comparable to imipenem and meropenem in  activity against s. aureus (methicillin susceptible, 0.06; resistant, 8) and s. pneumoniae (penicillin susceptible, < or =0.015; resistant, 1). against ceftazidime-susceptible enterobacteriaceae, the mic(90) of doripenem (0.12) was comparable to that of meropenem (0.12) and superior to that of imipenem (2), though susceptibility of isolates exceeded 99% for all evaluated carbapenems. the activity of doripenem was not notably altered against ceftazidime-nonsusceptible  or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase screen-positive enterobacteriaceae. doripenem was the most potent carbapenem tested against p. aeruginosa (mic(90)/% susceptibility [%s]: ceftazidime susceptible = 2/92%s, nonsusceptible = 16/61%s;  imipenem susceptible = 1/98.5%s, nonsusceptible = 8/56%s). against imipenem-susceptible acinetobacter spp., doripenem (mic(90) = 2, 89.1%s) was twice as active by mic(90) as were imipenem and meropenem. overall, doripenem potency was comparable to those of meropenem and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and doripenem was equal or superior in activity to meropenem and imipenem against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactam-nonsusceptible isolates. doripenem was the most active carbapenem tested against p. aeruginosa regardless  of beta-lactam resistance.

TI  == degradation of uniquely glycosylated secretory immunoglobulin a in tears from patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the integrity of secretory (s)-iga in tear fluid during bacterial keratitis and to evaluate the significance of specific pseudomonas aeruginosa extracellular proteases in the observed degradation of s-iga. methods: the integrity of component chains of s-iga in tear fluid from patients with keratitis caused by p. aeruginosa, streptococcus group g, moraxella catarrhalis,  staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and the iga1 protease-producing streptococcus pneumoniae were compared with s-iga in tear fluid, colostrum, and saliva from healthy individuals and with tear s-iga incubated with clinical isolates and genetically engineered p. aeruginosa strains with different protease profiles. degradation of s-iga and the significance of its glycosylation were analyzed in western blot analysis developed with antibodies against individual chains of s-iga. results: secretory component (sc)  of s-iga secreted by the lacrimal glands was more abundantly glycosylated than sc in colostrum and saliva. s-iga degradation was observed only in tears from p. aeruginosa-infected patients, in a pattern similar to that observed in incubation of tear samples with p. aeruginosa strains and to an extent closely correlated with their expression and activity of individual proteases. experiments using isogenic mutants of p. aeruginosa pao1 lacking either elastase or alkaline protease indicated that several proteases were working in concert. conclusions: surprisingly, sc of tear s-iga is more abundantly glycosylated than sc of s-iga in other secretions, a difference of potentially great functional significance. primarily, sc and alpha-chains are partially degraded in vivo during pseudomonas  keratitis by the concerted action of several proteases, including elastase and alkaline protease.

TI  == effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (ec) enhances the activities of  aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus gordonii. this phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. the purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against p. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and s. epidermidis. an eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or ec to biofilm-coated coupons were used. no significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) cfu/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for s. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. we  detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes ec were used against mrsa biofilms (p = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes ec against s. epidermidis biofilms (p = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). the results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of  the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by ec is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.

TI  == the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy. part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  == the japanese society of chemotherapy (jsc) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from january to august 2006. with the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout japan, a  total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (rtis). antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 staphylococcus aureus, 200 streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 streptococcus pyogenes, 165 haemophilus influenzae, 91 moraxella catarrhalis, 74 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the central laboratory of the research center for anti-infective drugs of the kitasato institute, according to recommendations issued by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). the antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including  one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. the incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing  abpc-resistant (blnar), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). three (2.1%) of the 143 p. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult rti to various antibacterial agents. these data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == determination of antibacterial activity of polyenzyme preparations gumseb using in vitro methods.
AB  == a novel polyenzyme formulation gumseb developed by advanced enzyme technologies ltd, thane and speciality biochemicals co., usa, was tested for antibacterial properties using atcc strains and clinical isolates of salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. a modified antibiotic susceptibility test  was used for the purpose. s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were found to  be sensitive to the formulation at the chosen concentration. next, to study the interaction between gumseb and currently used antibiotic, a checkerboard minimum  inhibitory concentrations (mic) was carried out for each organism. the assay was  carried out with the aim of establishing whether the polyenzyme formulation had any potentiating effect on the antibiotic of choice. synergistic effect was established when gumseb was used in conjunction with penicillin against s. pyogenes. partial synergy was established when it was used in conduction with ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa and with ciprofloxacin against methicillin sensitive, coagulase positive s. aureus. antagonism was established when it was used in conjunction with ampicillin against e. coli, with ciprofloxacin against s. typhi and coagulase negative staphylococcal strain. the results indicate that  gumseb can be used in conjunction with those antibiotics with which a synergistic or a partially synergistic effect could be shown, as in the case of p. aerugionosa and s. aureus. these findings have particular importance since these  organisms are responsible for hospital based infections and are notorious for antibiotic resistance. in cases where antagonism was established, it should not be used in combination with that particular antibiotic. however, it can be used individually since it has proved to have antibacterial activity and mic could be  determined for all five commonly encountered pathogens. therefore, it has the potential of being a novel broad range antibacterial drug. these findings are significant given the alarming rise in incidence of antibiotic resistance in most clinically important pathogens.

TI  == survey of childhood empyema in asia: implications for detecting the unmeasured burden of culture-negative bacterial disease.
AB  == background: parapneumonic empyema continues to be a disease of significant morbidity and mortality among children despite recent advances in medical management. to date, only a limited number of studies have assessed the burden of empyema in asia. methods: we surveyed medical records of four representative large pediatric hospitals in china, korea, taiwan and vietnam using icd-10 diagnostic codes to identify children <16 years of age hospitalized with empyema  or pleural effusion from 1995 to 2005. we also accessed microbiology records of cultured empyema and pleural effusion specimens to describe the trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of empyema. results: during the study period, we identified 1,379 children diagnosed with empyema or pleural effusion (china, n =  461; korea, n = 134; taiwan, n = 119; vietnam, n = 665). diagnoses of pleural effusion (n = 1,074) were 3.5 times more common than of empyema (n = 305), although the relative proportions of empyema and pleural effusion noted in hospital records varied widely between the four sites, most likely because of marked differences in coding practices. although pleural effusions were reported  more often than empyema, children with empyema were more likely to have a cultured pathogen. in addition, we found that median age and gender distribution  of children with these conditions were similar across the four countries. among 1,379 empyema and pleural effusion specimens, 401 (29%) were culture positive. staphylococcus aureus (n = 126) was the most common organism isolated, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 37) and klebsiella (n = 35) and acinetobacter species (n = 34). conclusion: the age and gender distribution of empyema and pleural effusion in children in these countries are similar to the us and western europe. s. pneumoniae was the second  leading bacterial cause of empyema and pleural effusion among asian children. the high proportion of culture-negative specimens among patients with pleural effusion or empyema suggests that culture may not be a sufficiently sensitive diagnostic method to determine etiology in the majority of cases. future prospective studies in different countries would benefit from standardized case definitions and coding practices for empyema. in addition, more sensitive diagnostic methods would improve detection of pathogens and could result in better prevention, treatment and outcomes of this severe disease.

TI  == beta-lactams against emerging 'superbugs': progress and pitfalls.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is an ever-growing problem. so-called 'superbugs', such as multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring multiple resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, efflux pumps and downregulated outer-membrane proteins or porins, are becoming more prevalent in hospital, intensive and long-term care settings. enterobacteriaceae are also acquiring a myriad of beta-lactamases, such as class a and d carbapenemases, and plasmid-borne class c cephalosporinases. gram-positive superbugs, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate or heteroglycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), are problematic pathogens,  both in the hospital and in the community (e.g., community-acquired mrsa and prsp). beta-lactam antibiotics remain among the most effective and safest anti-infectives in use, although their utility is being severely challenged by these superbugs. this review will discuss aspects of resistance seen in these pathogens and will review some of the newer beta-lactam agents, both investigational and in clinical use, that target these superbugs.

AB  == the activity of dc-159a, a novel orally administered fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution methods against 1,149 recently collected clinical isolates from five continents. against pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (ca-rtis), the mic(90)s were 0.12 microg/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015 to 0.03 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, 0.03 microg/ml for moraxella catarrhalis, and 0.12 microg/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci. similarly, dc-159a was potent against various types of staphylococci (mic(90) range, 0.03 to 2 microg/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), 4 microg/ml), wild-type isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic(90) range, 0.06 to 2 microg/ml), wild-type pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90), 2 microg/ml), and acinetobacter spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml). fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible organism subsets usually had elevated  dc-159a mics, but the mics were often two- to fourfold lower than those of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. in conclusion, dc-159a appears to possess a balanced broad spectrum of activity that exceeds the activities of the currently  marketed fluoroquinolones, especially against pathogens that cause ca-rtis.

TI  == bacterial resistance surveillance in china: a report from mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in china. a total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15  cities throughout china. antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by clinical and  laboratory standards institute. the results of the mics revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of  staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of staphylococcus epidermidis strains. penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. five strains of enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. all staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. a high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the gram-positive cocci. enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation  cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. about 65% of the escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less  than 10%. imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant  isolates. combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. amikacin was active against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. in conclusion,  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive s. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in china. no glycopeptides-resistant staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci was seldom.

TI  == pattern recognition receptors and interleukin-8 mediate effects of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria on lung epithelial cell function.
AB  == background and purpose: lung epithelial cells express pattern recognition receptors, which react to bacteria. we have evaluated the effect of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria on interleukin-8 (cxcl8) release from epithelial cells and the integrity of the epithelial barrier. experimental approach: primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells and the epithelial cell line a549 were  used, and cxcl8 release was measured after exposure to gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria. epithelial barrier function was assessed in monolayer cultures of a549 cells. results: gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus or  streptococcus pneumoniae, induced release of cxcl8 from human airway epithelial cells. these bacteria also disrupted barrier function in a549 cells, an effect mimicked by cxcl8 and blocked by specific binding antibodies to cxcl8. gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa induced greater release of cxcl8 than gram-positive bacteria. however, gram-negative bacteria did not affect epithelial barrier function directly, but prevented disruption induced by gram-positive bacteria. these effects of gram-negative bacteria on barrier function were mimicked by fk565, an agonist of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (nod1) receptor, but not by the toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 agonist bacterial lipopolysaccharide. neither the gram-negative bacteria nor fk565 blocked cxcl8 release. conclusions: these data show differential functional responses induced by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in human lung epithelial cells. the nod1 receptors may have a role in preventing disruption of  the epithelial barrier in lung, during inflammatory states.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == testing human biologicals in animal host resistance models.
AB  == the purpose of immunotoxicity testing is to obtain data that is meaningful for safety assessment. host resistance assays are the best measure of a toxicant's effect on the overall ability to mount an effective immune response and protect the host from infectious disease. an outline is presented for immunotoxicological evaluation using host resistance assays. the influenza virus host resistance model is useful to evaluate the overall health of the immune system and is one of the most thoroughly characterized host resistance models. viral clearance requires all aspects of the immune system to work together and is the ultimate measure of the health of the immune system in this model. mechanistic immune functions may be included while measuring viral clearance and include: cytokines, macrophage activity, natural killer (nk) cell activity, cytotoxic t-lymphocyte (ctl) activity, and influenza-specific igm and igg. measurement of these immunological functions provides an evaluation of innate immunity (macrophage or  nk activity), an evaluation of cell-mediated immunity (cmi) (ctl activity), and an evaluation of humoral-mediated immunity (hmi) (influenza-specific igm or igg). measurement of influenza-specific igm or igg also provides a measurement of t-dependent antibody response (tdar) since influenza is a t-dependent antigen. there are several targeted host resistance models that may be used to answer specific questions. should a defect in neutrophil and/or macrophage function be suspected, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or listeria monocytogenes host resistance models are useful. anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals or therapeutics for rheumatoid arthritis or crohn's disease that  target tnfalpha may also be evaluated for immunotoxicity using the s. pneumoniae  intranasal host resistance assay. marginal zone b (mzb) cells are required for production of antibody to t-independent antigens such as the polysaccharide capsule of the encapsulated bacteria that are so prominent in causing blood-borne infections and pneumonia. intravenous infection with streptococcus pneumoniae, an encapsulated bacterium, results in a blood-borne infection that requires mzb cells for clearance. the systemic s. pneumoniae host resistance assay evaluates whether a therapeutic test article exerts immunotoxicity on mzb cells and measures the t-independent antibody response (tiar). suppression of cmi or in some cases hmi may result in reactivation of latent virus that may result in a fatal disease such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). the murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) reactivation model may be used to evaluate a pharmaceutical agent to determine if suppression of cmi or hmi results in reactivation of latent virus. candida albicans is another host resistance model to test potential immunotoxicity. host resistance assays have been the ultimate measure of immunotoxicity testing for environmental chemicals and pharmaceutical  small molecules. human biologicals are now an important component of the drug development armamentarium for biotech and pharmaceutical companies. many human biologicals are fusions of igg, and/or target immune mediators, immunological receptors, adhesion molecules, and/or are indicated for diseases that have immune components. it is therefore necessary to thoroughly evaluate human biological therapeutics for immunotoxicity. numerous biologicals that are pharmacologically  active in rodents can be evaluated using well-characterized rodent host resistance assays. however, biologicals not active in rodents may use surrogate biologicals for testing in rodent host resistance assays, or may use host resistance assays in genetically engineered mice that mimic the effect of the human biological pharmacological agent.

TI  == the antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
AB  == trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to  have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. we found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, in addition to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. a similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 a62d/m63l, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to nacl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. this enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.

(2) the common  pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included se (78 strain,  49.4%), ec (23 strain, 14.6%), kp (17 strain, 10.8%), sa (14 strain, 8.9%), onz (14 strain, 8.9%), sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) the number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including ec (441 strains, 21.9%), h (430 strains, 21.3%), sp (368 strains, 18.2%), kp (253 strains, 12.5%), sa (207 strains, 10.3%), se (149 strains, 7.3%), pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) there were  120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including ec (78 strains, 65%), kp (25 strains, 20.8%), onz (7 strains, 5.8%), pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) there were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including ec 167 strains, (33.6%), sa (126 strains, 25.4%), se (46 strains, 9.3%), h (44 strains, 8.9%), onz (37 stains, 7.4%), kp (31 strains, 6.2%), sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and pa (20 strain, 4.0%). the trend of  drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. the proportion of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcns) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. the total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (esbl(s)) in ec and kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of hemophilus influenzae (hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.the proportion of mrsa was 17.2% and the mrcns rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of esbl(s) in ec and kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. conclusion: the distribution of common pathogenic bacteria  seen in chengdu children's hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance  of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.

TI  == subdural empyema in children--20-year experience in a medical center.
AB  == background and purpose: subdural empyema (sde) is a serious neurological condition in children and adults. although otorhinolaryngeal infections are regarded as the most important predisposing factors in the literature, this has not been our experience. this study reviewed clinical data on pediatric patients  with sde at our institution over the last 20 years. methods: charts of children hospitalized in mackay memorial hospital from 1985 to 2005, with a final diagnosis of sde were reviewed. gender, predisposing factors, symptoms and signs, bacteriologic data, diagnostic work-up, treatment procedures, and outcome were collected and analyzed. results: in total, 31 patients were enrolled. twenty seven of them (87.1%) were below the age of one year. the male-to-female ratio was 1.21. only 3 patients (9.7%) had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections; 6 patients (19.4%) had sde following head trauma or surgery. the leading clinical manifestations were fever (96.8%), seizure (70.1%), and focal neurological signs  (58.1%). the most common pathogens included streptococcus pneumoniae (16.1%), group b streptococcus (12.9%), haemophilus influenzae type b (12.9%), salmonella  spp. (12.9%), escherichia coli (9.7%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.7%). cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte counts and protein levels were usually high and the glucose levels were usually low. sde was first suspected or found via brain sonography in 9 infants. nine patients (29.0%) received only medical treatment for sde. three patients (9.7%) died--all were infected by s. pneumoniae. twelve patients (38.7%) recovered without neurological sequelae. conclusions: in the past 20 years, most of our cases of pediatric sde occurred in infancy, and only one-tenth of them had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections. brain sonography could  be a helpful tool for early diagnosis of sde in infancy.

TI  == population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of biapenem in paediatric patients.
AB  == objective: to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for biapenem in paediatric patients and to use the parameter estimates to assess pharmacodynamic  exposure of common bacterial populations. methods: biapenem plasma concentrations (n = 125) from 25 paediatric patients were analysed using nonmem. the parameter estimates were used in a monte carlo simulation to predict the exposure time during which the drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration. results: a two-compartment model fitted the data, and creatinine clearance (cl(cr)) and total body weight (tbw) were the most significant covariates. the final model was cl (l/h) = 0.0458 x cl(cr), v(c) (l) = 0.162 x tbw, q (l/h) = 2.05, v(p) (l) = 1.73, where cl is the clearance, v(c) is the volume of distribution of the central compartment, q is the intercompartmental clearance and v(p) is the volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. biapenem regimens of 5 mg/kg q8h and 10 mg/kg q8h provided sufficient pharmacodynamic exposures to pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae  in most typical patient populations. conclusion: these results better define the  pharmacokinetics of biapenem and help in the choice of the appropriate dosage regimens for paediatric.

TI  == microbiology of otitis externa in the secondary care in united kingdom and antimicrobial sensitivity.
AB  == introduction: otitis externa is one of the most common conditions seen in the otolaryngology clinics. there are no recently published studies that have looked  at the causative pathogens of the otitis externa seen in secondary care in the united kingdom and their antimicrobial sensitivities. we present results of a prospective study to determine the current bacteriology of the condition. methods: swabs were taken from the external auditory canals of the patients who presented to the otolaryngology emergency clinic with symptoms of otitis externa. these were analysed using microscopy, culture and sensitivity testing in one laboratory. the samples were cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, sabouraud agar, fastidious anaerobes agar with neomycin and staph/strep agar. antimicrobial sensitivities of isolated pathogens were tested on iso-sensitest and blood agars  using the bsac disc diffusion template program. results: the most commonly identified pathogen was pseudomonas aeruginosa (45.1%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (9%), anaerobes (6.3%), beta haemolytic streptococcus group g (2.8%), beta haemolytic streptococcus group a (1.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae  (0.7%), methicillin resistant s. aureus (0.7%), candida species (9.7%), aspergillus species (4.2%) and absidia corymbifera (0.7%). one hundred percent resistance of pseudomonas isolates to neomycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and amoxicillin was observed while most were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100%), polymixin b (100%) and gentamicin (98.5%). s. aureus isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and flucloxacillin (100%). 92.3% were sensitive to neomycin and chloramphenicol. resistance to penicillin and amoxicillin is observed. all isolates anaerobes were sensitive to metronidazole. conclusion: polymixin b, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin topical preparations should be used as first line treatment of otitis externa. if the infection does not settle swab results should be used to guide further treatment.

TI  == crystal structure of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (fabk) from streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the binding mode of an inhibitor.
AB  == enoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductases are critical for bacterial type ii fatty acid biosynthesis and thus are attractive targets for developing novel antibiotics. we determined the crystal structure of enoyl-acp reductase (fabk) from streptococcus pneumoniae at 1.7 a resolution. there was one dimer per asymmetric unit. each subunit formed a triose phosphate isomerase (tim) barrel structure, and flavin mononucleotide (fmn) was bound as a cofactor in the active  site. the overall structure was similar to the enoyl-acp reductase (er) of fungal fatty acid synthase and to 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (2-nd) from pseudomonas aeruginosa, although there were some differences among these structures. we determined the crystal structure of fabk in complex with a phenylimidazole derivative inhibitor to envision the binding site interactions. the crystal structure reveals that the inhibitor binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the active  site of fabk, and this is accompanied by induced-fit movements of two loop regions. the thiazole ring and part of the ureido moiety of the inhibitor are involved in a face-to-face pi-pi stacking interaction with the isoalloxazine ring of fmn. the side-chain conformation of the proposed catalytic residue, his144, changes upon complex formation. lineweaver-burk plots indicate that the inhibitor binds competitively with respect to nadh, and uncompetitively with respect to crotonoyl coenzyme a. we propose that the primary basis of the inhibitory activity is competition with nadh for binding to fabk, which is the first step of the two-step ping-pong catalytic mechanism.

TI  == epidemics of drug-resistant bacterial infections observed in infectious disease surveillance in japan, 2001-2005.
AB  == background: drug-resistant bacteria have been increasing together with advancement of antimicrobial chemotherapy in recent years. in japan, the target diseases in the national epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases (nesid) include some drug-resistant bacterial infections. methods: we used the data in the nesid in japan, 2001-2005. target diseases were methicillinresistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrpa) infections. the numbers of patients reported by sentinel hospitals (about 500) on a monthly basis were observed. results: the numbers of patients per month per sentinel hospital of 2001-2005 were 3.37-3.98 in mrsa, 0.96-1.19 in prsp, and 0.11-0.13 in mdrpa infections. the sex ratios (male / female) of patients were 1.69-1.82, 1.34-1.43, and 1.71-2.52, respectively. more than 50% of all patients were adults aged 70 years or older in mrsa and mdrpa infections, but more than 60% were children under 10 years in prsp infections. the number of patients per sentinel hospital in mrsa infections showed little variation between months, but evidenced a large  variation in prsp and mdrpa infections. the annual trend in the number of patients per sentinel hospital was increasing significantly for the 5-year period in mrsa and prsp infections, but not in mdrpa infections. conclusions: we revealed sex-age distributions of the patients reported to nesid in japan, 2001-  2005. an increasing incidence of mrsa and prsp infections and monthly variation in prsp and mdrpa infections were observed for the 5-year period. extended observation would be necessary to confirm these trends and variations.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols.
AB  == a series of nine 3-arylamino-1-chloropropan-2-ols 2a-2i were synthesized and their anti-fungal activity against pathogenic strains of aspergillus fumigatus, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger and candida albicans, and antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains of salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumonae and staphylococcus aureus were evaluated using different assay systems. 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active anti-fungal compound against three pathogenic strains under study, i.e., a. fumigatus, a. flavus and a. niger; the compound showed more than 90% inhibition of growth of a. fumigatus at a concentration of 5.85 microg/ml in disc diffusion  assay. interestingly, 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol did not show  any toxicity up to a concentration of 4000 microg/ml. although 1-chloro-3-(4'-chlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was about 8 times less active than  the standard compound amphotericin b, its toxicity was many more fold less than the toxicity of amphotericin b. further, 1-chloro-3-(2',6'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against c. albicans. in the anti-microbial assay, 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol were found to be the most active compounds against salmonella typhi and 1-chloro-3-(3',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol was found to be the most active compound against p. aeruginosa. although, the activities of 1-chloro-3-(2',4'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol and 1-chloro-3-(3',5'-dichlorophenylamino)-propan-2-ol are about half the activity of the standard anti-bacterial compound tetracycline, these compounds also were many fold less toxic than the standard drug.

TI  == associated antimicrobial resistance in escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == associated resistance to four to six related and unrelated antimicrobial agents was investigated in consecutive non-duplicate isolates of escherichia coli (n = 39 425), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1070), staphylococcus aureus (n = 7489), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1604) and streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2531). in all species, high proportions (76.5-88.9%) of isolates were susceptible to all the drugs investigated. irrespective of species, isolates resistant to one drug were  more likely to be resistant to any of the other drugs than were susceptible isolates. thus, trimethoprim resistance in e. coli was 38.4% among ampicillin-resistant vs. 3.9% among ampicillin-susceptible isolates, and erythromycin resistance in strep. pneumoniae was 41% among doxycycline-resistant  vs. 1% among doxycycline-susceptible isolates. in all five species investigated,  there was also significant associated resistance among unrelated drugs, highlighting the fact that resistance development occurs primarily among bacteria already resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. for the clinician, pronounced resistance associations mean that when empirical therapy fails because of resistance, there is a reduced chance of choosing an alternative successful empirical agent. for the epidemiologist, who uses routine clinical susceptibility data to describe resistance development, resistance associations mean that if the dataset contains results for isolates selected on the basis of their susceptibility to another drug, structurally related or not, a bias of false resistance is introduced.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs)  were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and  human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.

TI  == sustained desensitization to bacterial toll-like receptor ligands after resolution of respiratory influenza infection.
AB  == the world health organization estimates that lower respiratory tract infections (excluding tuberculosis) account for approximately 35% of all deaths caused by infectious diseases. in many cases, the cause of death may be caused by multiple  pathogens, e.g., the life-threatening bacterial pneumonia observed in patients infected with influenza virus. the ability to evolve more efficient immunity on each successive encounter with antigen is the hallmark of the adaptive immune response. however, in the absence of cross-reactive t and b cell epitopes, one lung infection can modify immunity and pathology to the next for extended periods of time. we now report for the first time that this phenomenon is mediated by a sustained desensitization of lung sentinel cells to toll-like receptor (tlr) ligands; this is an effect that lasts for several months after resolution of influenza or respiratory syncytial virus infection and is associated with reduced chemokine production and nf-kappab activation in alveolar macrophages. although such desensitization may be beneficial in alleviating overall immunopathology, the reduced neutrophil recruitment correlates with heightened bacterial load during secondary respiratory infection. our data therefore suggests that post-viral desensitization to tlr signals may be one possible contributor to the  common secondary bacterial pneumonia associated with pandemic and seasonal influenza infection.

TI  == effects of systemic antibiotic therapy on bacterial persistence in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients.
AB  == objective: bacterial respiratory tract colonization predisposes critically ill patients to intensive care unit (icu)-acquired infections. it is unclear to what  extent systemic antibiotics affect colonization persistence. persistence of respiratory tract colonization, and the effects of systemic antibiotics hereon, were determined in a cohort of icu patients. design: clinical and microbiological data were collected from 715 admitted mechanically ventilated icu patients with bacterial growth documented in respiratory tract samples. first day of colonization, persistence of colonization and antibiotic effects hereon were analyzed for six groups of pathogens: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and  haemophilus influenzae. systemic antibiotics were grouped into 'effective' and 'ineffective' antibiotics, based on in-vitro susceptibility data for the relevant bacteria. the effects of antibiotics were quantified as relative risk (rr) of bacterial persistence in the absence of effective antibiotics. measurements and results: persistence of colonization differed significantly between pathogens, ranging from 4 days (median) for h. influenzae and strep. pneumoniae to 8 days for p. aeruginosa. systemic antibiotics were administered on 7,102 (61%) of patient days. antibiotic use was associated with non-persistence for all pathogens, except acinetobacter species and p. aeruginosa. rr for non-persistence (as compared to ineffective or no antibiotics) ranged from 3.1 (95% ci 1.4-6.6) for h. influenzae to 0.5 (0.3-1.0) for acinetobacter species. conclusions: in mechanically ventilated patients, persistence dynamics of bacterial respiratory tract colonization, and the effects of (in-vitro) effective antibiotics hereon, are pathogen-specific.

TI  == community acquired pneumonia in port harcourt rivers state of nigeria.
AB  == background: community acquired pneumonia (cap) is a major cause of death world wide. knowledge of the likely pathogens and their sensitivity/resistance pattern  can help in the choice of antibiotic therapy and improve outcome. objective: to identify the seasonal variation; age and sex distribution; bacteriology; antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of isolates; haematological data; radiology and clinicaloutcome of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in adult patients admitted  to hospital in port harcourt, nigeria. design: prospective study. setting: university of port harcourt teaching hospital, and braithwaite memorial hospital, port harcourt, rivers state. patients: adults admitted to the hospitals with cap  between 1 may 2002, and 30 april 2003. interventions: a diagnostic strategy using regular collection of sputum samples for gram stain, bacteriological culture and  chest radiography were done. blood cultures were done in severe cases. antibiotic sensitivity testing was done on the positive cultures. results: during a 12 month period, 54 patients aged 16 to 82 years (mean 38.1 years) were evaluated. a total of 944 medical admissions were seen during the same period. this gives a prevalence rate of 5.7%. twenty six classes of bacteria were isolated from the sputum of 23 patients (yield, 42.6%). streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common pathogen, was isolated in nine cases (34.6%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae which was present in eight (30.8%). other isolates included, escherichia coli, four cases (15.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa, three cases (11.5%), and staphylococcus aureus, two cases (7.7%). the commonest radiological pattern was lobar consolidation (49.9%) with no distinct pattern associated with any conventional bacterial pathogen. the isolates showed good sensitivity to the newer and more expensive antibiotics (quinolines and cephalosporines) with marked resistance to the older and cheaper ones. however, clinical responses to benzyl penicillin and gentamycin were found to be good. out of 54 patients evaluated, four (7.4%) died. conclusion: streptococcus pneumoniae and klebsiella were common aetiological organisms of cap in port harcourt. treatment of cap with benzyl penicillin remains an appropriate first line choice in this environment while the more expensive quinolines and cephalosporines can be used as backups.

TI  == the bovine salivary proteins bsp30a and bsp30b are independently expressed bpi-like proteins with anti-pseudomonas activity.
AB  == the family of bpi-like proteins are thought to play a role in innate immunity of  the airways and oral cavity. they have similarities with bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi), an important host defence molecule in mammals, in the nucleotide sequence of their mrnas, organisation of exons and their predicted protein structure. we compared the expression and function of 2 of the 13 known bovine bpi-like proteins, bsp30a and b, which together constitute 30% of the total protein in bovine saliva. despite their recent divergence, we found that the two proteins have unique expression patterns, considerable inter- and intra-animal variation in abundance and differ  in their glycosylation status. recombinant and native bsp30a and b exhibited growth suppression activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae. native bsp30a and b had no significant lipopolysaccharide-binding activity. these data provide functional evidence supporting a role for the bpi-like proteins in host defence and suggest that bsp30a and b contribute to the growth suppression function of bovine saliva through a mechanism independent of lps opsonisation.

TI  == comparison of the bacteriostatic effects, corneal cytotoxicity, and the ability to seal corneal incisions among three different tissue adhesives.
AB  == purpose: to compare the bacteriostatic effects, corneal cytotoxicity, and ability to seal corneal incisions among fibrin glue and 2 commercially available cyanoacrylate derivatives: n-butyl cyanoacrylate and methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate. methods: the bacteriostatic activities of these tissue glues were verified by measuring the zones of bacterial growth inhibition surrounding the adhesive droplets on agar plates inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, or mycobacterium chelonae.  corneal cytotoxicity was tested by a direct contact method by using cultured bovine corneal epithelial cells, keratocytes, and corneal endothelial cells challenged with droplets of adhesives. each of the cells was treated with droplets of adhesives. the ability to seal corneal incisions was verified by calculating the maximum intraocular pressure resistant to leakage of rabbit corneal stab wounds sealed with tissue adhesives. results: methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate and n-butyl cyanoacrylate showed bacteriostatic effects against s.  aureus, s. pneumoniae, and m. chelonae but not p. aeruginosa and e. coli. in contrast, fibrin glue had no such effects against either gram-positive or -negative bacteria (p < 0.01). methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate showed the highest levels of corneal cytotoxicity, followed by n-butyl cyanoacrylate. fibrin glue, however, showed minimal cytotoxicity (p < 0.01). methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate and  n-butyl cyanoacrylate also displayed a greater ability to seal corneal incisions  than that of fibrin glue (p < 0.01). conclusions: the bacteriostatic effects, corneal cytotoxicity, and ability to seal corneal incisions differed among the 3  compounds tested. these different properties should be considered when choosing tissue adhesives during corneal surgery.

TI  == evaluation of dosing designs of carbapenems for severe respiratory infection using monte carlo simulation.
AB  == using the monte carlo simulation method, the influence of various doses and dosing frequencies of carbapenems on the antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are the main causative organisms of respiratory infections, was studied with the aim of identifying optimized effectiveness. based on pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters of individual carbapenems in healthy adults, data on changes in the respective blood concentrations in 2000 cases were simulated by applying a lognormal distribution to probability distributions of their volume of distributions and half-life periods. based on minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distribution data of the individual carbapenems against these strains, mics in the 2000 cases were also simulated. using these data in blood concentrations and mics, the probabilities of attaining various percentages of the dosing interval during which drug concentrations remain above mic (t > mic) were calculated at several dosing regimens. considering the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal effect (50% t>mic) and daily drug costs, imipenem (ipm) at 500 mg i.v. bid, panipenem (papm) at 500 mg i.v. bid, and biapenem (bipm) at 300 mg i.v. bid against streptococcus pneumoniae; meropenem (mepm) at 500 mg i.v. bid or tid against haemophilus influenzae infections; and mepm at 500 or 1000 mg i.v. tid against pseudomonas aeruginosa, each over 30 min, were determined as appropriate empirical treatments. selecting carbapenems with superior antimicrobial activities and optimizing their dose regimens are important to improve the efficacy. application of monte carlo simulation to mic distributions  allows determination of appropriate empiric therapy even if drug susceptibility of a causative organism in individual patients is unknown.

TI  == postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  == background: antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. however, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. methods: to evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between january 2000 and december 2004. for patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. results: a postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). sixty patients (78.9%)  experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. a microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. pathogens responsible for the infections were staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group b streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable streptococcus organisms (n = 2), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), haemophilus spp. (n = 9), branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), enterobacteriaceae (n  = 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and candida spp. (n = 4). according to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. conclusions: this study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.

TI  == mode of antibacterial action of a signal peptide, pep27 from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of pep27  and its mode of action. the results indicated pep27 exhibited antibacterial activities against pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria without hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, but it did not exhibit antifungal activity. to understand the mode of action of pep27, the cellular distribution of the peptide was investigated. flow cytometry analysis exhibited pep27 penetrated  the bacterial membrane by an energy-independent pathway without any damage to the membrane when examined using liposome and membrane probe. after penetration into  the bacterial cells, pep27 was not affected by macromolecular synthesis, but activated protein phosphatase activity in dose ranges of 10-15 microm and time range of 5-10 min in case of staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. these results demonstrated the antibacterial activities of pep27 are fundamentally attributable to a physiological change by activated phosphatase activity.

TI  == [species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated raisus using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto  a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell  suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas  aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in  mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests.  with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.

TI  == penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  == the authors topically administered gatifloxacin (gflx) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. they received 0.3% gflx ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for gflx concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. the mean intraoperative gflx concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/ml. gflx level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/ml in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/ml) in the patients less than 70 years old. this concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (mic90), such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) in vitro. the gflx concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, and mrsa in vitro.

TI  == implementation of a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations in canada.
AB  == background and objectives: bacterial screening in apheresis platelet preparations was implemented in march of 2004 by canadian blood services (cbs) using the bact/alert system. the aim of this study was to develop, validate and implement an in-house proficiency testing programme to evaluate cbs performance of bacterial screening in platelet preparations. study design and methods: during development of the proficiency testing programme, apheresis platelet preparations were spiked with 10(1) and 10(2) colony forming units per ml of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae. the preparations were stored at 2-8 degrees c prior to culture bottle inoculation with 4 or 6 ml on days 7-10 (estimated time from panel preparation to testing at  cbs centres). upon implementation, a combination of four proficiency panel members, including positives and negatives, were distributed to each of the centres that participated in the programme. a survey was conducted with 43 america's blood centers to assess whether they screen for bacterial testing in platelet preparations and whether they have implemented a proficiency testing programme. results: the development of the proficiency testing programme showed that s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa produced positive results at both concentrations and volumes on days 7-10 poststorage. streptococcus pneumoniae did not grow consistently and therefore was not selected for implementation of the programme. two proficiency testing panel sets have been issued (july 2006 and february 2007) with 14 out of 15 (93%) and 14 out of 14 (100%) of the participant centres meeting the expected results for bacterial screening, respectively. the majority (72%) of the america's blood centers that screen for bacterial contamination have not implemented a proficiency testing programme and 94.4% of these centres are interested in developing such a programme. conclusion: canadian blood services has successfully implemented a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations, which will contribute to improving  the safety of the platelet supply in canada.

TI  == [the role of cell wall organization and active efflux pump systems in multidrug resistance of bacteria].
AB  == multiple antibiotic resistance of clinically important bacteria are of major concern worldwide. alterations of drug targets or enzymatic inactivation of antimicrobial agents are the well known mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance. besides these well known mechanisms, recent studies have shown that a further resistance mechanism, active drug efflux, has become increasingly important in the current threat of multidrug resistance. it involves certain bacterial transport proteins which pump out toxic antimicrobial compounds from the cell. drug efflux pump proteins in bacteria fall into five distinct protein super families [atp binding cassette super family (abc), major facilitator super  family (mfs), small multidrug resistance super family (smr), multidrug and toxic  compound extrusion (mate) super family, resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) super family] and are mostly encoded by chromosomal genes. among them, the members of rnd protein super family are widely distrubuted in gram negative bacteria and play siginificant role in both, intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance of these bacteria with very wide substrate specificity. rnd type multidrug efflux proteins usually function together with an outer membrane canal  protein (omp) and a membrane fusion protein (mfp) to pump out drugs. acrab-tolc of escherichia coli and mexab-oprm of pseudomonas aeruginosa are the typical examples of these tripartite systems. they are constitutively expressed in wild type cells and play significant role in intrinsic resistance of these bacteria. however, multidrug resistance which is of major clinical significance, rises as a result of overexpression of these pump systems due to mutations and elevated levels of resistance are recorded to structurally unrelated antimicrobial drugs such as fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and toxic compunds. synthesis of rnd type pump proteins are regulated by complex genetic mechanisms and global activator proteins (mara, soxs, rob) are significant in the induction of overexpression of  these efflux pump systems. outer membrane of gram negative bacteria with its unique lipopolysaccharide rich structure also contributes to drug efflux and other antimicrobial resistance mechanisms by reducing the influx rate of toxic antimicrobial compunds. multidrug efflux pump proteins found in gram positive bacteria and mycobacteria are usually the members of protein super families other than rnd family and their substrate profiles are more limited. however, some of these efflux proteins (nora, msra, qaca in staphylococcus aureus; pmra and emea in streptococcus pneumoniae) have clinical significance in the resistance to several antimicrobial agents (fluoroquinolones, macrolids) and toxic substances (quarternery ammonium compounds). in this review article, the role of cell wall organization and active efflux pump systems in multidrug resistance of bacteria have been discussed.

TI  == health care-associated pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia: a single-center experience.
AB  == pneumonia occurring outside of the hospital setting has traditionally been categorized as community-acquired pneumonia (cap). however, when pneumonia is associated with health care risk factors (prior hospitalization, dialysis, residing in a nursing home, immunocompromised state), it is now more appropriately classified as a health care-associated pneumonia (hcap). the relative incidences of cap and hcap among patients requiring hospital admission is not well described. the objective of this retrospective cohort study, involving 639 patients with culture-positive cap and hcap admitted between 1 january 2003 and 31 december 2005, was to characterize the incidences, microbiology, and treatment patterns for cap and hcap among patients requiring hospital admission. hcap was more common than cap (67.4% versus 32.6%). the most  common pathogens identified overall included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (24.6%), streptococcus pneumoniae (20.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.8%), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), and haemophilus influenzae (8.5%). the hospital mortality rate was statistically greater among patients with hcap than among those with cap (24.6% versus 9.1%; p < 0.001). administration of  inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment was statistically more common among hcap patients (28.3% versus 13.0%; p < 0.001) and was identified as an independent risk factor for hospital mortality. our study found that the incidence of hcap was greater than that of cap among patients with culture-positive pneumonia requiring hospitalization at barnes-jewish hospital. patients with hcap were more likely to initially receive inappropriate antimicrobial treatment and had a greater risk of hospital mortality. health care providers should differentiate patients with hcap from those with cap in order to provide more appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
AB  == enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces  its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug  interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of  h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also  studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.

TI  == bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors: a result of maxillary sinus punctures.
AB  == rhinosinusitis is a common complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) who receive radiotherapy. an impaired mucociliary clearance due to this treatment may be the major cause of rhinosinusitis in these irradiated patients.  the relative frequency with which various pathogens cause rhinosinusitis in these patients is unknown. this study investigates the bacteriology of acute rhinosinusitis in irradiated npc patients by maxillary sinus puncture. from october 2001 through july 2006, 20 irradiated npc patients with radiograph-proven acute maxillary sinusitis received maxillary sinus punctures. aspirate contents of the sinuses were collected for aerobic and anaerobic cultivation. a total sampling of 26 sides was performed in the 20 patients. the culture rate was 85%.  frequently identified aerobes and facultative anaerobes included alpha-hemolytic  streptococcus (n = 8), staphylococcus aureus (n = 5) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3). streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, however, are far less common. this may provide important information about the antibiotic therapy in irradiated npc patients with acute rhinosinusitis.

AB  == the in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. all isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared mueller-hinton broth and by disk diffusion. portions of these data were submitted to the food and drug administration (fda) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. in a separate study, mic and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. the tigecycline mics at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for haemophilus  spp., 0.25/0.5; for enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. the data from this study confirm the fda-approved mic and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for streptococcus spp. other than streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and enterobacteriaceae. provisional breakpoints for haemophilus spp. and s. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. the following mic and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; s. aureus atcc 25923, 20 to 25 mm; escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and  20 to 27 mm; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 9 to 13 mm, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; s. pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226, 30 to 40 mm.

TI  == [comparison of nursing home-acquired pneumonia with community-acquired elderly pneumonia].
AB  == to clarify whether the environment of a nursing home affects the clinical features of patients with pneumonia, we compared the characteristics of 103 patients (nursing home group) who suffered from pneumonia at a nursing home with  153 elderly patients with the same background (community group) who lived in their own home. although there were no significant differences in crp, wbc, and body temperature at admission and duration of hospitalization, the degree of independency of the nursing home group was significantly lower than the community group. as the degree of independency became worse, the length of hospitalization  extended and mortality increased. bacteriological findings of sputum culture showed that methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was cultured in 20 cases (19%) of the nursing home group and 18 cases (13%) of the community group.  in isolated analysis of total care cases, mrsa positive rates were similar in the nursing home group (17/58; 29%) and the community group (8/30; 27%). only 1 case  with penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp) was found in the nursing home group, however 7 species of pssp were cultured in the community group, including 5 self-help cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured in 8 patients of each group, and most of them were total care cases. we concluded that the difference in frequency and species of bacteria depended on the condition of  patients, rather than the environment, and differences in conditions might lead to differences in clinical features.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinically isolated respiratory bacterial pathogens in japan between 2005 and 2006.
AB  == the current status of the susceptibility of the main respiratory bacterial pathogens was evaluated by analysing the antibacterial activity of 21 drugs, including four carbapenems, against five species of the pathogens isolated between january 2005 and january 2006. a total of 157 strains were studied. carbapenems inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus strains at concentrations that were below the breakpoints set by the japanese society of chemotherapy (2 and 1mug/ml for pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infection, respectively). however, the majority of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to carbapenems. meropenem, but not the other carbapenems, inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae isolates, including beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of <or=1 microg/ml. the mic(50) and mic(90) of meropenem, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, against pseudomonas aeruginosa were the lowest of the carbapenems. by comparing these results with our previous data, it was found that there was no increase in  resistance to carbapenems in any of the species tested. thus, it can be stated that carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.

AB  == a total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and other selected antibiotics. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against fqs. the isolation  rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. most strains of enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to fqs. the resistance rate of escherichia coli against fqs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. the fqs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while fqs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was around 5%. the fqs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), however, it was lower than that of mrsa. in pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from uti and 15-19% of  from rti was resistant to fqs. acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to fqs. although fqs-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in japan. in this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to fqs.

TI  == usefulness of bronchoscopic microsampling to detect the pathogenic bacteria of respiratory infection.
AB  == background: bronchoscopic microsampling (bms) is a method in which a device consisting of a wire with a polyester probe at the tip is used to collect bronchial epithelial lining fluid with bronchoscopy. in this study, we bacteriologically investigated sample collection using bms to incorporate bms into diagnosis of respiratory infection. methods: strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mycobacterium avium complex (mac), were used for experiments. in the standard sampling procedure using bms, the probe coming out of the sheath was immersed in approximately 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml bacterial suspension for 30 s and cut into a tube  containing 1 ml of normal saline solution. the tube was stirred for 1 min using a vortex. the sampling rate was calculated by the following equation: (actual amount of bacteria collected by bms [colony forming units per milliliter])/(bacterial amount in suspension for sampling [colony forming units per milliliter]) x 100 (percentage). results: the sampling rate of s pneumoniae,  h influenzae, and mac showed no significant difference among three bacteria, but  the sampling rate of p aeruginosa was higher. the shortened time of sampling, stirring, and the reduced bacterial amount in the suspension (1/100) did not significantly affect the rates of standard procedure. in contrast, in comparison  with a protected specimen brush (psb), the recoveries of s pneumoniae, h influenzae, and mac using psb were significantly lower than those by bms, but the recovery of p aeruginosa was not significantly different. conclusion: this in vitro study might suggested the usefulness of bms as a new diagnostic technique capable of quantitative and stable sampling.

TI  == synthesis, stereochemistry and antimicrobial evaluation of t(3)-benzyl-r(2),c(6)-diarylpiperidin-4-one and its derivatives.
AB  == in a wide research program toward new and efficient antimicrobial agents, a series of t(3)-benzyl-r(2),c(6)-diarylpiperidin-4-ones (1-7) were synthesised and tested for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities. also, the structures and their stereochemistry of these synthesised compounds 1-7 were characterized by ir, high resolution (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr and (1)h-(13)c cosy spectra. the analysis of coupling constants of compounds 1-5 reveals that they exist in normal chair conformation with equatorial orientations of all the substituents. the spectra of 6 and 7 reveal the presence of two isomers labeled as e (carbonyl carbon is anti to benzyl group at c-3) and z (carbonyl carbon is syn to benzyl group at c-3) in solution and the coupling constants ruled out the  possibility of normal chair conformation. from the theoretical studies and coupling constant values the favoured conformation for the z- and e-isomers of 6  and 7 was found to be the boat conformations. their antibacterial activity against streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activity against cryptococcus neoformans, candida 6, candida 51, aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus were  also evaluated.

AB  == from october 2004 to september 2005, we collected the specimen from 319 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 383 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 381 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 87, streptococcus pneumoniae 80, haemophilus influenzae 78, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 35, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 9, klebsiella pneumoniae 15, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 30, etc. of 87 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-sensitive s. aureus: mssa) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) were 40 (46.0%) and 47 (54.0%) strains, respectively. against mssa, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. against mrsa, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. arbekacin (abk) also showed the potent activity and its mic90 was 2 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. in contrast, there were high-resistant strains (mic: 128 microg/ml or more) for abk  (2.5%), erythromycin (37.5%), and clindamycin (38.8%). against h. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the  strains at 0.125 microg/ml. meropenem showed the most potent activity against p.  aeruginosa (mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), amikacin (amk) had the most potent activity and its mic90 was 4 microg/ml. the activity of czop against the non-mucoid type also was preferable and its mic90 was 8 microg/ml. against k. pneumoniae, czop, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, flomoxef were the most potent activity and inhibited the  growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml. also, all the agents generally showed a potent activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of them were 4 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (57.0%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 50.8% and 23.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with  bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (21.6%), s. pneumoniae (24.7%) and h. influenzae (20.1%). s. aureus (20.9%), s. pneumoniae (16.1%), and h. influenzae (16.1%) also were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (22.3%) and h. influenzae (25.1%). the bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were p.  aeruginosa and the isolation frequency was 43.5%.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa in the calgary health region: emergence of vim-2-producing isolates.
AB  == a study was designed to describe the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant (cr) pseudomonas aeruginosa in a large well-defined geographical region with a centralized laboratory system serving one pediatric and three large adult hospitals (acute care centers i, ii, and iii). molecular characterization was done using pcr with sequencing of the integron-associated gene cassettes. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) using a modified combined stenotrophomas maltophilia and streptococcus pneumoniae protocol with spei was performed on cr p. aeruginosa strains isolated in the calgary health region during 2002-2006. the majority (96%) of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing isolates produced vim-2 with gene cassettes aacc1 and aaca4, while 4% produced imp-7 with gene cassettes aacc4 and aacc1. eighty-six percent of vim-2 producers  belonged to a cluster (mblv) that was responsible for nosocomial outbreaks during 2003 (intensive care unit) and 2004 (bone marrow transplant unit) at acute care center i. environmental isolates from these units also belonged to mblv. the majority of strains from cluster mblvr (related to mblv) were present in acute care center iii. isolates producing imp-7 belonged to a different cluster (mbli)  and were related to strains described during the 1990 s. pfge of the mbl-negative cr strains showed that 37% belonged to a closely related cluster, nmbl, whose members were predominantly isolated from acute care center ii. our findings suggest that cr and dissemination of mbl clusters among p. aeruginosa populations in large geographic healthcare regions are dynamic processes that require continuous molecular surveillance.

TI  == pneumonia after cecal ligation and puncture: a clinically relevant "two-hit" model of sepsis.
AB  == sepsis continues to be the primary cause of death among patients in surgical intensive care units. in many cases, death does not result from the initial septic event but rather from subsequent nosocomial infection with pneumonia being the most common etiology. in addition, most deaths in patients with sepsis occur  after the first 72 h. by contrast, in most animal models of sepsis, most deaths occur within the first 72 h. the purpose of this study was to develop a clinically relevant "two-hit" model of sepsis that would reflect delayed mortality because of secondary nosocomial infection. the well-accepted and widely used cecal ligation and puncture (clp) model was used as the "first hit". pseudomonas aeruginosa or streptococcus pneumoniae was used to induce pneumonia in mice 72 h after clp as a "second hit." in this study, mortality in mice undergoing clp followed by pneumonia was significantly higher than in mice receiving pneumonia or clp alone. s. pneumoniae pneumonia after clp resulted in a 95% mortality compared with a 20% mortality for pneumonia alone, p < 0.0001. similarly, mortality of p. aeruginosa pneumonia after clp (85%) was significantly higher than p. aeruginosa alone (20%), p < 0.0001. mice undergoing clp followed by p. aeruginosa pneumonia also had significantly higher levels of b- and t-cell  apoptotic death. finally, mice undergoing clp followed by p. aeruginosa or s. pneumoniae pneumonia had significantly decreased concentrations of proinflammatory mediators monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin (il)-6 compared with mice undergoing clp or pneumonia alone. in conclusion, a primary sublethal infection impairs the immune system thus rendering the host more susceptible to secondary infection and death. double injury, that is, clp followed by pneumonia, provides a useful tool in the study of sepsis, creating a  prolonged period of infection as opposed to clp alone. the extended duration of infection may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of the immune dysregulation seen in clinical sepsis and therefore provides for evaluation of potential therapies that target specific stages of the immune response.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains through zmpc, a metalloproteinase virulence factor.
AB  == several microbial pathogens stimulate the ectodomain shedding of host cell surface proteins to promote their pathogenesis. we reported previously that pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus activate the ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1 and that syndecan-1 shedding promotes p. aeruginosa pathogenesis in mouse models of lung and burned skin infections. however, it remains to be determined whether activation of syndecan-1 shedding is a virulence mechanism broadly used by pathogens. here we show that streptococcus pneumoniae stimulates  syndecan-1 shedding in cell culture-based assays. s. pneumoniae-induced syndecan-1 shedding was repressed by peptide hydroxamate inhibitors of metalloproteinases but not by inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways previously found to be essential for syndecan-1 shedding caused by p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, or other shedding agonists. a 170-kda protein fraction with a peptide  hydroxamate-sensitive shedding activity was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, deae chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography. mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the 170-kda fraction is composed of zmpb and  zmpc, two metalloproteinase virulence factors of s. pneumoniae. both the purified 170-kda zmpb/zmpc fraction and unfractionated s. pneumoniae culture supernatant generated syndecan-1 ectodomains that are smaller than those released by endogenous shedding. further, a mutant s. pneumoniae strain deficient in zmpc, but not zmpb, lost its capacity to stimulate syndecan-1 shedding. these data demonstrate that s. pneumoniae directly sheds syndecan-1 ectodomains through the  action of zmpc.

TI  == high prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. in korea: a konsar program in 2004.
AB  == a nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in korea. in this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by konsar group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. in hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. the most prevalent species was staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals,  but escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. the proportions of enterococcus faecium to all isolates of enterococcus faecalis plus e. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. the mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals  were: oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant e. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). in conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp.  and p. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae,  and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin interacts with airway mucus.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) and mucins are components of airway secretions and  both contribute to the innate host defense system. at neutral ph, amps are positively charged, mucins negatively. it was the aim of the study to test whether these opposite charges result in interactions between amps and mucins. we measured binding of mucins isolated from porcine gastric mucosa to the cathelicidin ll-37 coated to multiwell plates and found that ll-37 electrostatically interacts with mucins. circular dichroism spectra of the peptide revealed the induction of alpha-helical conformation by mucins. addition  of mucins to solutions of ll-37 significantly decreased the antimicrobial activity of the peptide against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae. we then tested whether ll-37 is bound to mucins in airway secretions  from human subjects and found that a significant proportion of the peptide and its propeptide are bound to high molecular weight components. together these data show that cationic amps interact with anionic mucins in airway secretions. functions of amps are modulated by this interaction.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

TI  == comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2004).
AB  == a contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in north america was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. most of  the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. the rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >staphylococcus  aureus (13.8%) >moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >escherichia coli (7.8%) >pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). both cefepime and ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 microg/ml; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against s. pneumoniae. however, the s. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible s. aureus, (mic(90), 4 microg/ml; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (mic(90), 16 microg/ml) was active against only 86.7% of strains. h. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (mic(90), < or =0.5 microg/ml; 100.0%), and 34.0% of h. influenzae and 99.2% of m. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against e. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against klebsiella spp. cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against enterobacter spp. (mic(90), 2 microg/ml; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). against p. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in north america.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

AB  == to determine whether and by which pathway (via the death receptor or mitochondrial mediated pathway) lymphocyte apoptosis occurs in pneumonia and to determine if increased bronchial epithelial cell apoptosis occurs in pneumonia. prospective randomized study in a university research laboratory. male c57bl/6 mice (n = 30). animals received an intratracheal injection of streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa to induce gram-positive or gram-negative pneumonia, respectively and were killed 24, 30, or 48 h later. presence of pneumonia was confirmed via gross visual examination of lungs and by histology. lymphocyte apoptosis in spleen and thymus was analyzed by flow cytometry for active caspases 3, 8, and 9 and by immunohistochemical (ihc) staining for active  caspase 3 and dna strand breaks. respiratory epithelial cell apoptosis was assessed by ihc. histologically, pneumonia was present in all bacteria-treated animals but none in sham-treated mice. extensive lymphocyte apoptosis in spleen and thymus was documented by characteristic morphological changes on hematoxylin  and eosin staining and by ihc staining in both s. pneumonia and p. aeruginosa infection. flow cytometry confirmed ihc and showed apoptotic lymphocytes positive for active caspases 3, 8, and 9 in both thymi and spleens in both infections. in  contrast to the extensive lymphocyte apoptosis, only rare scattered apoptotic changes were seen in respiratory epithelial or endothelial cells in pneumonia due to either organism. increased lymphocyte but not bronchial cell apoptosis occurs  in both gram-positive and gram-negative pneumonia and probably involves both the  extrinsic and intrinsic pathway.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activities of japanese rice-fluid against helicobacter pylori strains.
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori has now been widely recognized as a causative agent of gastroduodenal diseases. the development of safer anti- h. pylori compounds is desirable due to the antibiotic-resistant strains emerged to date. methods: we successfully developed the compounds of rice-fluid derived from unpolished, polished, and usually cooked japanese rice, and investigated their in vitro antibacterial activities by means of the time-kill-curve methods against various species of bacteria including h. pylori strains. results: all of the compounds revealed keen bactericidal activities against h. pylori, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae and campylobacter jejuni strains, but failed to affect the viability of other bacterial species investigated including staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative rods belonging to the family enterobacteraceae. the bactericidal activities were demonstrated to be time- and concentration-dependent. conclusions: the compounds of rice-fluid are considered to be potentially new and safe therapeutic regimens against h. pylori  infections. the mechanism of their bactericidal activities against h. pylori strains remains to be elucidated.

TI  == respiratory tract infections: at-risk patients, who are they? implications for their management with levofloxacin.
AB  == two of the most serious respiratory tract infections are community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb). the most common pathogens found in patients with these infections are haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. pseudomonas aeruginosa is also relatively common, particularly in elderly patients with aecb. s. pneumoniae and  p. aeruginosa are also of concern in relation to the development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. the administration of antibiotics at doses that result in concentrations exceeding the mutant prevention concentration at the site of infection is one strategy to prevent the development of drug-resistant pathogens. aecb is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, particularly in patients treated in the intensive care unit. cap is also associated with significant risks and often requires treatment under hospital supervision. several patient-related factors help identify those patients who are most at risk of mortality and morbidity. treatment should be tailored towards the severity of  the disease. the fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are an effective treatment option for aecb and cap. compared with many other antibiotics, resistance to levofloxacin remains low for most infecting pathogens. the oral bioavailability of levofloxacin is over 99%, enabling simple switching from intravenous to oral therapy during treatment. it is also preferentially distributed to compartments in the lung, thus achieving high concentrations at the site of respiratory tract infections. combined with cover of the major infecting pathogens found in patients with aecb and cap, and a cost-effective treatment compared with many alternative therapies, levofloxacin is an attractive option for the treatment of at-risk patients with these respiratory tract infections.

AB  == objective: the database at the ent-department, aarhus university hospital describing the specific local flora of acute otitis media (aom) and acute mastoiditis (am) in aarhus county has become the key element in securing a rational and specific antibiotic treatment. we present our data concerning aom, mastoidismus and am. our purpose is to determine (i) clinical presentation, (ii)  causative pathogens, (iii) resistance patterns, (iv) type of antibiotic treatment, and (v) accuracy of the antibiotic treatment. methods: patients under  the age of 18 years, treated for aom with extensive affected well-being and am, at the ent-department, aarhus university hospital during 3 years from january 2001 to december 2003. results: a total of 106 patients were identified. sixty-seven patients with aom and 39 patients with am. the overall bacterial flora found is dominated by s. pneumococci all 100% susceptible to penicillin. however, staphylococcus aureus is the primary bacterial pathogens cultured from patients treated with preadmission antibiotics. conclusion: if a specimen from an aom patient is obtained after the initiation of antibiotic treatment one should consider the possibility of the culture found being a result of the initial led treatment and not the causative aom pathogen. our data suggest that a restricted  use of antibiotics in children with aom may be associated with a higher incidence of acute mastoiditis. significant higher leucocytes count and crp are found in the acute mastoiditis group compared to the aom group.

TI  == bacterial neuraminidase facilitates mucosal infection by participating in biofilm production.
AB  == many respiratory pathogens, including hemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, express neuraminidases that can cleave alpha2,3-linked sialic acids from glycoconjugates. as mucosal surfaces are heavily sialylated, neuraminidases have been thought to modify epithelial cells by exposing potential bacterial receptors. however, in contrast to neuraminidase  produced by the influenza virus, a role for bacterial neuraminidase in pathogenesis has not yet been clearly established. we constructed a mutant of p.  aeruginosa pao1 by deleting the pa2794 neuraminidase locus (delta2794) and tested its virulence and immunostimulatory capabilities in a mouse model of infection. although fully virulent when introduced i.p., the delta2794 mutant was unable to  establish respiratory infection by i.n. inoculation. the inability to colonize the respiratory tract correlated with diminished production of biofilm, as assessed by scanning electron microscopy and in vitro assays. the importance of neuraminidase in biofilm production was further demonstrated by showing that viral neuraminidase inhibitors in clinical use blocked p. aeruginosa biofilm production in vitro as well. the p. aeruginosa neuraminidase has a key role in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting bacterial glycoconjugates  and contributing to the formation of biofilm. inhibiting bacterial neuraminidases could provide a novel mechanism to prevent bacterial pneumonia.

TI  == comparison of throat swabs and nasopharyngeal suction specimens in non-sputum-producing patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == both throat swabs and nasopharyngeal suction (nps) specimens are used for microbiological assessment in non-sputum-producing patients with cystic fibrosis  (cf), but studies comparing their diagnostic yield are lacking. we, therefore, conducted a prospective study in young cf patients, in which both techniques were performed in random order. forty-seven consecutive cf children aged 6 months to 10 years were studied during routine visits to the clinic. cf relevant pathogens  were found in the majority of patients with no significant differences in the rate of positive cultures for staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. a statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of detection of other organisms with only 9/47 (19%) of throat swab specimens and 27/47 (57%) of nps specimens being positive (p = 0.0004). this included 12 positive cultures for streptococcus pneumoniae and 11 cultures that were positive for moraxella catarrhalis, both of which are frequent colonizers of the upper airway. therefore, the most common bacterial pathogens affecting the cf lung appear to be detected in similar frequency by throat swab as by nasopharyngeal suction. there is evidence that nasopharyngeal suction yields more specimens of streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis, which may reflect upper airway colonization rather than lower airway infection. we conclude that nasopharyngeal suction is not routinely warranted as there is no benefit over throat swab in detection of cf pathogens in infants and young children with  cf.

TI  == [use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  == our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. due to the time elapsed from the time of  specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. we therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. we divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together.  the time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). the identified causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. the utility of transport medium for examination of general  bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. the rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.

AB  == objective: this study had for aim to evaluate the rationale and indications for antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of copd and to identify potential differences among various antibiotics available for the treatment of exacerbations in france. methods: a search was performed in medline and for references quoted in identified articles from 1995 to 2005. open or blind randomized studies involving antibiotics available in france were reviewed. results: about 50% of all exacerbations are related to bacterial infection. haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae are the main pathogens responsible for bacterial exacerbations. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp are frequently found in patients with severe functional impairment. increased purulence of sputum is associated with bacterial infection. patients with severe functional impairment benefit the most from antibiotic treatment. although new molecules have larger antibiotic spectrum and  better pharmacological properties, the evidence supporting their use compared to  standard therapy remains scarce. conclusions: additional studies are needed to better identify the subset of patients benefiting from antibiotics and to determine whether new molecules produce significant improvement on relevant outcomes such as exacerbation free interval compared to standard therapy.

TI  == bacterial biofilms on the sinus mucosa of human subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  == introduction: chronic rhinosinusitis (crs) is a common disease poorly controlled  by antibiotics. postulated etiologies of crs include allergy, fungi, functional factors, and biofilm. objectives: we presented a preliminary study demonstrating  bacterial biofilms' presence on the sinus mucosa of patients with crs using fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). the advantage of fish in biofilm identification is that it is the only method that identifies the specific bacteria creating the biofilm matrix. we now present the results of a larger series of patients. methods: patients with crs scheduled for sinus surgery were enrolled in the study. biopsies of the sinus mucosa and cultures were taken at the time of surgery. control samples were taken from patients undergoing septoplasty. specimens underwent fish testing for streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenza, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: bacterial biofilms were present on 14 of 18 specimens. the predominant species were h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. p. aeruginosa biofilm was not identified on any specimens. the intraoperative cultures of the planktonic bacteria present in the sinuses did not correlate with the biofilms identified. two of the five control samples were positive for biofilm. conclusion: the presence of biofilms on the mucosa of patients with crs offers a  possible cause of antimicrobial therapy failure and could change the approach to  treatment. however, the presence of biofilms on healthy control samples implies that biofilms may simply be colonizers. the precise role that biofilms play in crs still remains to be determined. further studies with larger sample sizes are  needed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of substance p and neuropeptide y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  == infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically substance p and neuropeptide y. since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. neuropeptide y and substance p had antimicrobial activity against e. coli (mic 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml  sem and 71.5+/-15 sem microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (mic>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  (mic>500 microg/ml). while substance p and neuropeptide y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. however, this remains to be determined.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to provide a trinidadian perspective on pediatric community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacteremia via the documentation of common etiologic agents, antimicrobial profiles of the isolated  pathogens, and patient outcome. methods: this was a six-year retrospective study  of children with bacteremia admitted to the pediatric wards of the san fernando general hospital, trinidad. results: seven hundred and four episodes of pediatric bacteremia were reviewed during the six-year study period. the predominant isolate was staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and enterobacter spp (11.1%). the remaining isolates each accounted for less than 10% of total isolates. the mortality rate was highest for p. aeruginosa (39.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae (22.5%), and escherichia coli (19.2%). of the six cases due to neisseria meningitidis, only two survived. the overall mortality rate for the study period  was 15.1%, but varied considerably according to age. all deaths due to p. aeruginosa and e. coli occurred in neonates. almost 90% and about half of all s.  aureus were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively; nineteen (11.3%) were methicillin-resistant. more than 95% of k. pneumoniae and more than  87% of haemophilus influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. group b streptococci  were fully susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but showed  >90% and >70% resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. of the 40 strains of s. pneumoniae isolated, 10.0% had a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) >or=4 microg/ml (resistance) and 12.5% had a mic=2.0 microg/ml (intermediate resistance) to ceftriaxone, while 7.5% showed intermediate resistance (mic between 0.12 and 1 microg/ml) and 25.0% showed resistance (mic >or=2 microg/ml) to penicillin. conclusion: the bacteremia rate was found to be 8.4% among hospitalized children suspected of having sepsis and from whom a blood culture was positive. bacteremia was also associated with a high mortality rate of 15.1%. an unusually high level of bacteremia with gram-negative enteric bacteria was seen, which might indicate cross infection and reflect a breakdown in infection control measures. relatively high-level resistance of s. pneumoniae to penicillin and ceftriaxone was not seen, even though the overall prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics among other pathogens was relatively low. the drugs that showed the greatest efficacy were imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and the cephalosporins ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.

AB  == mastoiditis (m) is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. the incidence of m has decreased since the advent of antimicrobial agents. in the last decade, however, there has been a marked increased in the incidence of acute m in several communities, sometimes in association with the growing resistance of pneumococci. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and haemophillus influenzae are the most common organisms recovered in acute m. several recent studies demonstrated the predominance of pseudomonas aeruginosa in this infection. however, because p. aeruginosa colonizes the ear canal it can contaminate specimens obtained through the non-sterile ear canal. p. aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, s. aureus and anaerobic bacteria are the most common isolates in chronic m. anaerobes predominate in studies where adequate methods for their isolation are employed. management of uncomplicated m requires  the administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement. if no improvement occurs within 48 h, surgical intervention and drainage may be necessary. the procedure generally employed is simple mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube placement. radical mastoidectomy is performed only if there is no improvement after simple mastoidectomy.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bact/alert 3d and bactec systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  == objective: to compare bact/alert (bta) and bactec 9240 (bac), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. materials and methods:  blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented bta and bac standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. the time to growth detection (td) was recorded for each bottle that became positive.  a quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess td of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. results: a total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both bta and bac bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by bta bottles and 13 (56.5%) by bac. proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the bta system. the average tds were 19.0 and 24.6 h for bta and bac, respectively. analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same  for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa but slightly different for haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the anaerobic  bottle ofthe bta did not support the growth of h. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/ml whereas the bac did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml. td for  s. pneumoniae in the bta was about half of that in the bac. conclusions: the bta  system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the bac system to detect the same organism.

TI  == the effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs.
AB  == purpose: to determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in optisol-gs at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees c) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees c). methods: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. the first group consisted of  12 optisol-gs vials. the second group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the eye bank association of america (ebaa) protocols. each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per ebaa protocol. after 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (rt) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour rt), 54 (6 hour rt), 60 (12 hour rt), 72 (24 hour rt), and 96 (48 hour rt) hours. at 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured.  all samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees c. viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. results: except for the 10 cfu/ml inocula of p. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. rapid bactericidal activity was observed  against p. aeruginosa after 2 hours at rt, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. the rate and extent of killing against s. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at rt with 10  cfu/ml of s. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against s. pneumoniae and e. faecium following 24 hours of storage at rt. the presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from optisol-gs after 48 hours at rt. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at rt. bactericidal activity was not observed against e. faecium at either refrigerated  temperature or rt.

TI  == decreased bacterial clearance from the lungs of mice following primary respiratory syncytial virus infection.
AB  == virus respiratory infections often precede bacterial pneumonia in healthy individuals. in order to determine the potential role of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) in bacterial secondary infections, a mouse sequential pulmonary infection model was developed. mice were exposed to rsv then challenged with streptococcus pneumoniae (stpn). exposure of balb/c mice to 10(6)-10(7) plaque forming units (pfu) of virus of rsv significantly decreased stpn clearance 1-7 days following rsv exposure. this finding was not restricted to stpn alone: exposure to rsv followed by staphylococcus aureus (sa) or pseudomonas aeruginosa(pa) resulted in similar decreases in bacterial clearance. both bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) cell counts and pulmonary histopathology demonstrated that rsv-stpn exposed mice had increased lung cellular inflammation  compared to mice receiving stpn or rsv alone. the effect of rsv infection on bacterial clearance was dependent on the mouse genetic background: c57bl/6j mice  (relatively resistant to rsv infection) demonstrated a modest change in stpn clearance following rsv exposure, whereas fvbn/j mice (similar to the balb/cj mice in rsv susceptibility) demonstrated a similar degree of rsv-associated decrease in stpn clearance 7 days following rsv exposure. neutrophils from the rsv-stpn sequentially exposed balb/cj mice were functionally altered-produced greater levels of peroxide production but less myeloperoxidase (mpo) compared to  mice receiving stpn alone. these data demonstrate that rsv infection decreases bacterial clearance, potentially predisposing to secondary bacterial pneumonia despite increased lung cellular inflammation, and suggest that functional changes occur in the recruited neutrophils that may contribute to the decreased bacterial clearance.

TI  == [using antibiotics in case of influenza].
AB  == acute respiratory bacterial infection is the most common complication of influenza and a leading cause for excess rate of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death (pneumonia). influenza promotes bacterial infection as stated by epidemiologic evidence of temporal association between outbreaks or peaks of both influenza and bacterial pneumonia. the bacteria involved are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus. however, gram-negative rods, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes and  methicillin resistant s. aureus may be involved in institutionalized elderly patients. various studies confirm that antibiotics are over-prescribed in patients with influenza or influenza like illness, even in the absence of bacterial infection signs, and in patients without comorbidity. no data has proven the benefice of antibiotic prescription in influenza-infected patients without bacterial infection. neuraminidase inhibitors may be of interest for the  management of influenza infected patients, because they can decrease the risk of  bacterial complications and the use of antibiotics.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriology in recurrent tonsillitis among children and adults.
AB  == introduction: diagnosis and treatment of acute tonsillitis are one of the most common problems seen at an otorhinolaryngology clinic in both adult and paediatric populations. much has been written about bacteriology of recurrent tonsillitis but it remains a controversial topic. despite the fact that tonsillitis is so common, consensus seems to be lacking as to the main causative  organism and the differences between children and adults. the tonsillar core bacteriology of 233 patients with recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy from january 2000 to june 2003 is presented. methods: the patient population was divided into two groups, namely: the paediatric group and the adult group. 132 patients, whose age was more than 12 years, were in the adult group. 101 patients aged between two and 12 years, were in the paediatric group.  the bacteriology of the children and adults were tabulated according to their species, and were compared. results: 138 patients grew single pathogenic bacteria in their tonsillar core culture, 52 grew two different pathogenic bacteria, and the rest (43) grew normal bacterial flora. staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly-isolated bacterium and accounted for 40.9 percent of the total cultures  isolated; its prevalence was the same in the adults and children. beta-haemolytic streptococcus was isolated in 23 percent of subjects, and was predominantly from  group a (streptococcus pyogens). group a beta-haemolytic streptococci was more prevalent in children. pseudomonas aeruginosa, which rarely cause pathogenicity in tonsils, was cultured from nine (3.8 percent) of our study subjects. conclusion: this study showed that staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic bacteria cultured both in adults and children. klebsiella pneumonia, streptococcus pneumonia, escherichia coli and enterobacter are more prevalent in  adults. haemophilus influenza and streptococcus pyogens are more prevalent in children. pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a rare causative organism in recurrent tonsillitis. since the mechanism of activation of infection in recurrent tonsillitis is unknown, knowing the bacteriology does not help us to treat the disease. however, it may be a stepping stone to eventually understanding whether  the bacteria play a role in reactivating recurrent infections. from previous and  current studies, there is no relationship between bacteriology and recurrent infections.

TI  == endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  == background: there is considerable amount of debate in the literature regarding the microbial flora of normal, acutely infected, and chronically infected paranasal sinuses. few studies have specifically looked at the microbial flora of healthy and infected sinus cavities after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. methods: one hundred thirty-four cultures were studied. all cultures were obtained using a standard technique. the nasal cavities were decongested and anesthetized, and nasal endoscopy was performed. when purulent secretions were identified, specimens of purulent secretions were obtained for incubation. sensitivities were tested according to microorganisms identified. empiric therapy generally consisted of afluoroquinolone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or a later-generation cephalosporin, and adjustment in individual instances when appropriate. results: twelve cultures showed no growth, 86 grew a single microorganism, and 35 grew two or more microorganisms for a total of 151 microorganisms identified. the most common microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. other organisms that were cultured <5% of the time included streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenza, moraxella catarrhalis, serratia liquefaciens, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia, alcaligenes, fusobacterium, escherichia coli, diphtheroids, acinetobacter species, klebsiella species, skin flora, and mixed gram-negative and gram-positives. conclusion: endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis most commonly grew s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and pseudomonal species. these cultures altered antibiotic treatment management decisions in a significant number of cases regardless of patients' clinical characteristics or history of previous culture.

TI  == activity of gatifloxacin tested against isolates from pediatric patients: report  from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america, 1998-2003).
AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program has monitored the activity of antimicrobial agents worldwide since 1997. the increasing number of clinical failures with established anti-infectives (penicillins, other beta-lactams, macrolides) among pediatric patients has stressed the importance for alternative  therapeutic options. ciprofloxacin has been recently approved for expanded use as treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in children, and gatifloxacin has been used successfully in clinical trials in selected children with severe or refractory otitis media. we evaluated the activity of gatifloxacin against strains isolated from children < 7 years of age and compared this to the general  patient population (all ages included) using the sentry program database. a total of 59826 north american isolates were collected, of which 4641 were from children (< 7 years old); all isolates were tested using reference broth microdilution methods. in contrast to the general population (gp), gatifloxacin resistance rates were very low among isolates from this younger patient group. gatifloxacin  susceptibility rates were > 84% for all pathogens evaluated in younger patients.  all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from children < 7 years old were susceptible to gatifloxacin, and susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae species was > 98%. the greatest difference in susceptibility rates between the younger children and the gp was observed among nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (95.0-100% versus 64.8-83.7%, respectively) and enterococcus faecalis (94.7% versus 58.4%).  gatifloxacin susceptibilities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. isolates from the pediatric population were > or = 95% (> 97% for ciprofloxacin)  compared to the gp at only 64.8-69.1%. in conclusion, gatifloxacin remains very active against bacterial isolates from children < 7 years, indicative of the limited exposure of this population to fluoroquinolones. continued resistance surveillance will be necessary to monitor the activity of the fluoroquinolone class as they are introduced for specific clinical indications into the pediatric age groups, especially if re-studied against s. pneumoniae (refractory otitis media) and p. aeruginosa (cystic fibrosis associated pneumonia).

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the estonian experience.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.

AB  == nasal sinusitis, tonsillitis, and pharyngolaryngitis typify upper respiratory tract infections, while bronchitis and pneumonia typify lower respiratory tract infections. cases of paranasal sinusitis with severe suppuration are reportedly becoming less frequent, while those of chronic catarrhal paranasal sinusitis and  edematous allergic paranasal sinusitis are becoming more so, the primary factor in paranasal sinusitis, a typical infectious disease encountered in otolaryngology, is bacterial infection. the main causative bacteria are streptococcus pneumoniae, reported in 13.4% of cases, haemophilus influenzae in 12.8% moraxella catarrhalis in 5.5%, staphylococcus aureus in 26.5%, pseudomonas  aeruginosa in 5.2%, and anaerobes. the incidence of strains resistant to antimicrobial agents has grown for s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis and decreased for s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. acute exacerbation or  severe suppuration in chronic paranasal sinusitis requires the administration of  antimicrobial agents, with the same agent administered 2 weeks for maximal effect. first-line agents are ampc/cva, sbtpc, cdtr-pi, cfpn-pi, and gflx for adults, with aspc, sbpc, acpc, ctrx, cmz, fmox, papm/bp, and mepm injected in severe cases. attention must be paid to strains that resist cephems and macrolides, such as pisp, prsp, and blnar. in refractory chronic paranasal sinusitis, attention must also be paid to biofilms produced by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. suitable antimicrobial agents should be determined for treating of chronic paranasal sinusitis, in addition to the best procedure to ensure early recovery from inflammation, such as puncturing or irrigating the maxillary sinus, injecting a suitable agent, nebulization, and/or surgically widening the middle meatus.

TI  == moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin protect human respiratory epithelial cells against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae in vitro.
AB  == the fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin display excellent in vitro activities against many respiratory tract pathogens. here we show that moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin accumulate approximately 7- to 10-fold in primary  human respiratory epithelial cells, derived from nasal polyps and grown in 3-dimensional vesicles. furthermore, using these vesicles, we assessed the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin on staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae and that of ciprofloxacin on pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae. finally, we determined the protective effect of the fluoroquinolones  on vesicles infected with these pathogens. all four bacterial strains were highly toxic for vesicles. s. aureus and s. pneumoniae were readily killed by moxifloxacin regardless whether the antibiotics were present intra/extracellularly or only intracellularly in vesicles. similar results were obtained for the killing of h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa. exclusively intracellularly located fluoroquinolones rescued 42% to 76% of the cells after bacterial challenge compared to the rescue of 48% to 94% cells when the fluoroquinolones were present intra/ extracellularly. without addition of fluoroquinolones cell survival in vesicles was 0% to 38%. the results suggest that intracellular accumulation of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin is important for the protection of respiratory epithelial cells from the cytotoxic effects of  major respiratory tract pathogens.

TI  == contribution of immunocompetence to the antibacterial activities of ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == traditional in vitro models used to simulate human pharmacokinetics and to characterize the pharmacodynamics of antibacterial agents represent a totally immunosuppressed condition. however, host defense mechanisms contribute to the elimination of the pathogen from the infectious site in most of the patients suffering from infectious diseases. therefore, the attempt was made to introduce  immunocompetence into an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. immunocompetence was added either by using j774 macrophages growing as adherent monolayers in cell culture flasks, or by using a newly developed ex vivo model. this ex vivo model consists of sponges which have been implanted into rats for 24 h. after 24 h the  sponges are explanted; at this point in time the sponges are soaked with an inflammatory exudate to which the bacteria to be tested are added. into a slightly modified one-compartment model according to grasso the explanted sponges which are entrapped in dialysis tubings are added. neither the bacteria nor the inflammatory proteins nor the immunocompetent cells escape from the explants. thus, it is possible to simulate antibiotic kinetics without diluting bacteria, the polymorphonuclear cells (pmn) or the inflammatory exudates. this ex vivo model and the j774 cell culture model were used to compare the antibacterial effects of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and moxifloxacin against  streptococcus pneumoniae either in the absence or presence of any immunocompetence. in general, the presence of j774 macrophages resulted in an increased reduction of viable counts by 1 log10 titer. however, an increased killing of the bacteria studied by 3 to 4 log10 titers was seen in the presence of pmn and an inflammatory exudate. this increase in bacterial clearance is very  well in agreement with the data obtained in animal models of infection in immunocompetent animals as compared to immunocompromised animals. thus, it is possible to introduce immunocompetence into an in vitro model in order to simulate pharmacokinetics of antibacterial agents in the presence of an inflammatory exudate and immunocompetent cells. the use of this more complex model may complement the well-established in vitro kinetic simulation models.

TI  == stroke-associated pneumonia: microbiological data and outcome.
AB  == introduction: pneumonia is a common complication after acute stroke. it affects the outcome adversely. however, data regarding microbiology of stroke-associated  pneumonia and its effect on outcome is scarce. methods: stroke-associated pneumonia was identified through chart review of all icd-9 identified adult stroke patients admitted to our hospital over a period of four years (1998-2001). the demographical, laboratory, radiological, microbiological data and outcome of  patients with stroke-associated pneumonia were recorded and analysed. results: 443 patients with stroke were admitted over the four-year period and 102 (23 percent) had stroke-associated pneumonia. their ages range from 28 to 100 (mean 64+/-14) years. 69 (68 percent) were men. median length of stay was nine days compared to four days for all stroke patients. 68 (67 percent) patients manifested pneumonia within 48 hours and 34 (33 percent) after 48 hours of admission. yield of tracheal aspirate cultures was 38 percent and that of chest radiographs was 25 percent. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms (12 percent each) followed by streptococcus pneumoniae  and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 percent each). patients with infiltrates on chest radiographs were more likely to have positive tracheal aspirate cultures (p-value is 0.003). 35 patients (34 percent) expired during hospital stay. positive chest  radiographs and tracheal aspirates were independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay (p-value is less than 0.005). conclusion: pneumonia is a common medical complication of stroke. it is associated with a high mortality and prolongs the hospital stay. the yield of chest radiographs and tracheal aspirates is low. however, these are independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are most common organisms in stroke-associated pneumonia.

AB  == a 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the dar es salaam region of tanzania over the period november 1971-december 2002. laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and escherichia coli (14.1%). other isolates included pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and streptococcus uberis (4.2%). contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were candida species. the results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical candida albicans mastitis. the prevalence of candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in november 2002. conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae remain above 10%. the possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.

TI  == nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in hiv-infected patients: risk factors for adverse outcome and implications for rational empiric antibiotic therapy.
AB  == background: nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (nbp) was once considered a common cause of morbidity and mortality among advanced aids patients. however, clinical  and microbiological characteristics and outcome-associated risk factors in this population are poorly defined. patients: we conducted a retrospective study of all hiv-infected patients admitted during the period 1988-2002 at the infectious  diseases clinic of milan, italy, to determine incidence rate and factors affecting mortality of nbp, and to gather clinical and microbiological findings about the condition. results: we identified 120 episodes of nbp among 4,967 admissions of hiv-infected individuals. a reduction of incidence became evident after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). the more  common causative agents were pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%) staphylococcus aureus (25%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (21%). methicillin resistance was frequent among staphylococci (65%). the mortality rate of nbp was 25.8%. non-statistically significant factors associated with shorter survival were: cd4(+) count < 10 cells/microl, concomitant lung neoplasm, and complicated roentgenographic picture. only one factor was significantly associated with lower survival, both in univariate and multivariate analysis: a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus serving as an etiologic agent of pneumonia (rr 4.05; 95% ci, 1.076-15.239; p = 0.039). conclusion: a decline in incidence of nbp in hiv-infected individuals was observed after introduction of haart. s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were the leading causes of nbp, but frequency of pneumococcal pneumonia was significant. the sole predictor for mortality was methicillin-resistant staphylococcus as a pneumonia-causing agent.

TI  == regulation of phagocyte lifespan in the lung during bacterial infection.
AB  == the innate-immune response to infection is critically dependent on the antimicrobial actions of macrophages and neutrophils. host and pathogen have evolved strategies to regulate immune-cell antimicrobial functions via alterations in cell death. modulation of phagocyte death by bacteria is an important pathogenic mechanism. host benefits of phagocyte apoptosis also exist,  and understanding the mechanisms and consequences of apoptosis is essential before we can devise strategies to modulate this element of the innate-immune response to the host's benefit. this is of particular importance in an organ such as the lung, in which the balance between the need to recruit phagocytes to maintain bacterial sterility and the requirement to clear recruited cells from the alveolar units to preserve physiologic gas exchange must be finely tuned to ensure survival during bacterial infection. apoptosis clearly plays a critical role in reconciling these physiological requirements.

TI  == susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. individual dimers displayed  equivalent or lowered mic values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. coli, and vre. raised mic  values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. in comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against m. tuberculosis. structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower mics against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus. in contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of mics against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.

TI  == a study of bacterial isolates from corneal specimens and their antibiotic resistance profile.
AB  == objective: we aim to examine the spectrum of bacteria causing corneal infections  and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. this will serve as a guideline for  empiric therapy of corneal infections. methods: we conducted the study over a period of 18 months from march 2001 through december 2002 in king abdul-aziz university hospital, riyadh, kingdom of saudi arabia. corneal specimens taken from 200 patients were inoculated directly onto different types of media. the isolates were identified and then tested against the appropriate topical or systemic antibiotics. results: sixty-seven (33.5%) of the total specimens were culture positive and 133 (66.5%) were culture negative. fourteen (7%) of these showed organisms in the gram stained smears and correlated well with the culture  reports. of the 67 positive cultures, 53 (79.1%) were gram-positive bacteria mostly coagulase-negative staphylococci 29 (43.3%) followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae) 13 (19.4%). among gram-negative bacteria 14 (20.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) 10 (14.9%) was the predominant isolate. all the isolates were sensitive to ofloxacin and the commonly used ocular antibiotics. conclusion: all the isolated bacteria were sensitive to ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone. having marked potency for broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, make the fluoroquinolones especially the newer generations, a potential single drug therapy for corneal infections.

TI  == the crisis of resistance: identifying drug exposures to suppress amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is seen in both the hospital and community settings. approaches are required to minimize the increase in resistant strains, such as good antibiotic stewardship and the limiting of antibiotic use to appropriate circumstances. there are instances when drug dose and/or schedule can be used to  minimize the probability that mutants will take over the bacterial population. over the past several years, significant advances have been made in understanding the relationship between drug concentrations and amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations. in this review, we examine the use of preclinical models for facilitating this understanding. we also use mathematical techniques, including monte carlo simulation, to bridge between the identification of exposures to minimize resistance and the examination of candidate drug doses to achieve this end. examples are provided for pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in each instance, quinolone antimicrobials were examined. more investigations with other  pathogens and drug classes are required.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. it is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. in 1996 the american thoracic society (ats) published guidelines for empirical therapy of hap. this review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ats statement. early diagnosis of hap and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) or protected specimen brush (psb) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic bal/psb in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of hap is by definition empirical. epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. studies that have appeared since the ats statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for hap with multiresistant pathogens. in patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. the most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of hap (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical  ventilation. multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. to further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.since the ats statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for hap should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.

TI  == bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound t cell depletion.
AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == opening plugged tympanostomy tubes: effect of biofilm formation.
AB  == objective: to determine if the presence of a bacterial biofilm impacts the rate of clearing of mucoid plugs from tympanostomy tubes (tts). study design and setting: ex vivo model. stainless steel reuter bobbin tts (n = 18) were placed in growth medium with pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae for 12 days to promote biofilm formation. tympanostomy tubes (n = 18) placed in growth medium, without bacteria, for 12 days served as controls. biofilm formation was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. all tts were filled with middle ear mucus and allowed to dry, thereby forming a plug. tts were placed in a model ear  chamber, covered with ofloxacin otic solution, and the time to clear each plug was recorded. results: biofilm formation was consistently encountered on tts exposed to bacteria but in no tts in the control group. there was a significant effect of the biofilm on plug clearance, favoring tts without a biofilm (p = 0.0333). although there was no significant difference in the proportion of unplugged tts (p = 0.264), tts with a biofilm did not clear plugs as rapidly as tts without a biofilm (p = 0.0416). conclusions: the presence of a biofilm may slow the time to clear mucoid tt plugs, but it does not seem to affect the overall proportion of tts that are unplugged.

TI  == optimising dosing strategies of antibacterials utilising pharmacodynamic principles: impact on the development of resistance.
AB  == evolving antimicrobial resistance is of global concern. the impact of decreased susceptibility to current antibacterials coupled with the decline in the marketing of new agents with novel mechanisms of action places a tremendous burden on clinicians to appropriately use available agents. optimising antibacterial dose administration through the use of pharmacodynamic principles can aid clinicians in accomplishing this task more effectively. methods to achieve this include: continuous or prolonged infusion, or the use of smaller doses administered more frequently for the time-dependent beta-lactam agents; or  higher, less frequent dose administration of the concentration-dependent aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. pharmacodynamic breakpoints, which are predictive of clinical and/or microbiological success in the treatment of infection, have been determined for many classes of antibacterials, including the fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. although surpassing these values may predict efficacy, it may not prevent the development of resistance. recent studies seek to determine the pharmacodynamic breakpoints that prevent the development of resistance. numerous studies to this point have determined these values in fluoroquinolones in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. however, among the other antibacterial classes, there is a lack of sufficient data. additionally, a new term, the mutant prevention concentration, has been based on the concentrations above which resistance is unlikely to occur. future work is needed to fully characterise these target concentrations that prevent resistance.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the implications of a newly defined severity scoring of empyema in children for the prediction of surgical management and to compare the  length of hospitalization as an outcome measure of patients treated using medical therapy, salvage video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (vats) vs early elective vats. methods: a retrospective chart review of parapneumonic empyema of patients  below 18 years of age admitted to a tertiary children's hospital in northern taiwan from april 1993 to december 2002 was performed. patients were categorized  into a medical group who received antibiotic therapy, needle aspirations with/without tube thoracostomy; a salvage vats group when the patients required surgery for the relief of persistent fever > 38 degrees c, chest pains or dyspneic respirations despite initial medical therapy; an early vats group when the patients received elective surgery early after admission. the demographic data, clinical features, laboratory findings, and duration of hospitalization were compared using a severity score of empyema (sse). results: streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa. no organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. a pleural ph < 7.1 increases the odds of requiring surgical intervention by 6 times among this cohort. children who required decortication of empyema had a higher severity score (mean 4.8 vs 3.0, p < 0.005). the duration of hospitalization for  patients having early vats showed a shortening stay (mean 18 vs 28 days) as compared to salvage vats. conclusion: a pleural ph < 7.1 and a newly designed clinical severity score of empyema 4 are two predictors of surgical intervention  for fibrinopurulent empyema in the present study. early elective vats may be adopted not later than 7 days after failure of appropriate antibiotic therapy and adequate drainage of empyema to decrease the length of stay and minimize morbidity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of native and synthetic surfactant protein b peptides.
AB  == surfactant protein b (sp-b) is secreted into the airspaces with surfactant phospholipids where it reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse at  end expiration. sp-b is a member of the saposin-like family of proteins, several  of which have antimicrobial properties. sp-b lyses negatively charged liposomes and was previously reported to inhibit the growth of escherichia coli in vitro; however, a separate study indicated that elevated levels of sp-b in the airspaces of transgenic mice did not confer resistance to infection. the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial properties of native sp-b and synthetic peptides  derived from the native peptide. native sp-b aggregated and killed clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and group b streptococcus by increasing membrane permeability; however, sp-b also lysed rbc, indicating that the membranolytic activity was not selective for bacteria. both the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of native sp-b were inhibited by surfactant phospholipids, suggesting that endogenous sp-b may not play a significant role in alveolar host defense. synthetic peptides derived from native sp-b were effective at killing both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at low peptide concentrations (0.15-5.0 microm). the sp-b derivatives selectively lysed bacterial membranes and were more resistant to inhibition by phospholipids; furthermore, helix 1 (residues 7-22) retained significant antimicrobial activity in the presence of native surfactant. these results suggest that the role of endogenous sp-b in host defense may be limited; however, synthetic peptides derived from sp-b may be useful in the treatment of bacterial  pneumonias.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == [study of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of levofloxacin].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the dosing regimens of levofloxacin. methods: the drug concentrations in serum and urine were assayed by hplc method and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after intravenous infusion of a single dose of 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg levofloxacin to healthy volunteers. the in vitro activity mic of levofloxacin against 823 clinical isolates were determined  and compared with other antimicrobial agents. based on the above results, the pk/pd parameters c(max)/mic and auc/mic were calculated and the dosing regimens of levofloxacin were proposed for infections caused by different pathogens. results: the results of clinical pharmacokinetic study showed that the c(max) of  levofloxacin was 3.4 mg/l +/- 0.8 mg/l, 4.8 mg/l +/- 1.4 mg/l and 7.6 mg/l +/- 1.1 mg/l respectively, auc(0-infinity) was 14.4 mg.h/l +/- 2.5 mg.h/l, 21.9 mg.h/l +/- 4.5 mg.h/l and 38.3 mg.h/l +/- 4.9 mg.h/l respectively, t(1)/2 beta was 6.2 h +/- 0.4 h, 6.4 h +/- 0.9 h and 6.5 h +/- 0.6 h respectively, and 69% +/- 5%, 69% +/- 6%, and 65% +/- 4% of the doses were excreted in urine within 24  h after intravenous infusion of a single dose of levofloxacin 200 mg, 300 mg and  500 mg. the in vitro pharmacodynamic study showed that levofloxacin was highly active against hemolytic streptococcus and moraxella catarrhalis. it was active against streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin nonsusceptible strains), hemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. levofloxacin also had good activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and k.pneumoniae. however, most of isolates of enterococcal spp. were resistant to levofloxacin. above 50% of escherichia coli isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. based on the results of pk/pd parameters, the adequate dosing regimens of levofloxacin should be once daily 200 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of infections caused by m. catarrhalis. the regimen of 300 mg once daily could be effective for the treatment of infections caused by hemolytic streptococcus. 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae. for treatment of respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections caused by levofloxacin-susceptible organisms including k. pneumoniae,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s.maltophilia, 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was  needed to obtain good clinical efficacy. but pk/pd parameters predicted that 500  mg daily of levofloxacin was not effective for infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci. conclusion: the proposed dosing regimens of levofloxacin based on pk/pd concepts are expected to provide good efficacy in clinical practice.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == azithromycin and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has been structurally modified from erythromycin with an expanded spectrum of activity and improved tissue pharmacokinetic characteristics relative to erythromycin. this allows once-daily  administration for 3-5 days of treatment compared with traditional multi dosing 7-10-day treatment regimens. it has been successfully employed in lower respiratory tract infections. recent data indicate that azithromycin may exert anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory effects that may be of use in the treatment of both acute and chronic airway diseases. this review examines the role of azithromycin in lower respiratory tract infections analysing published data on exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia and cystic fibrosis both in adults and children. in addition, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug are also considered.

TI  == sensitivity of respiratory bacteria to lignocaine.
AB  == aim: lignocaine, a topical anaesthetic agent, is generally used in variable concentrations usually between 2% and 4% on the vocal cords prior to flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) procedures. the aim of this study was to investigate whether 2% or 1% lignocaine significantly inhibits the growth  of organisms commonly found in the respiratory tract, in particular streptococcus pneumoniae. method: in order to determine the antibiotic effect of lignocaine on  lower respiratory tract flora, five different organisms were examined in vitro using well diffusion, disc diffusion and microbroth dilution against 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine. results: antimicrobial activity could not be detected using the well diffusion and the disc diffusion methods, as lignocaine failed to diffuse through the media. the microbroth dilution method showed reproducible bactericidal effect of these respiratory isolates against streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae at 2%  concentration. lignocaine 2% showed no growth inhibition against pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. lignocaine 1% also partially inhibited s. pneumoniae. conclusion: as lignocaine shows significant inhibition of respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae even at a concentration of 1%, the lowest concentration possible should be used for flexible bronchoscopy and bal to maximise the chance of recovery of these organisms.

AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp, carbenin),  mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including papm against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the  incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 1,356 isolates of 28 species were tested, 1,221 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 1,403 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of papm were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of papm in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before carbenin was launched. this result suggests that  papm still maintains potent activity. in these surveillances spanning three years, the incidence rates of resistance in various species were as follows (2000.6-2001.3 --> 2001.4-2002.3 --> 2002.4-2003.3): methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (39.3% --> 43.9% --> 47.3%), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (48.9% --> 44.2% --> 25.7%), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, 13.8% --> 26.3% --> 43.2%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (0.9% --> 0% --> 1.4%), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 1.3% --> 3.1%), beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae (19.2% --> 8.9% --> 42.9%), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar, 22.1% --> 30.7% --> 33.0%), and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.0% --> 4.4% --> 1.0%). papm showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against prsp, whose incidence rate increased notably. blnar, whose incidence rates also increased, exhibited low susceptibility to all tested drugs and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing p. aeruginosa also exhibited high resistance. the findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as prsp, blnar, and metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == prevalence of etiologic bacteria and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis at phramongkutklao hospital.
AB  == background: to date, there is an increasing trend of prescribing antibiotics that cover beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as the first line drug for sinusitis patients in thailand this practice dose not only increases the treatment cost but might also induce resistance to antimicrobial agents. objective: to determine the prevalence of the pathogenic bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis as well as the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. material and method: the maxillary aspiration fluid specimens of 52 acute and chronic sinusitis patients at phramongkutklao hospital, bangkok, thailand during may 2002-may 2003, were collected. aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed and the beta-lactamase activities of isolated bacteria were determined. results: of 58 specimens, 44 (75.9%) and 14 (24.1%) specimens were collected from acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis patients, respectively. of 44 specimens of acute maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were haemophilus influenzae (13, 29.5%), streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 9%), streptococcus viridan (4, 9%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (4, 9%). 6 (13.6%) of them were beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. of 14 specimens of chronic maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (3, 16.6%), staphylococcus spp (3, 17.5%) and streptococcus spp. (2, 11.6%). 1 (7.1%) haemophilus influenza isolate from this group was beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. the percentage of anaerobe was  8.9%, 23.3% for acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis, respectively. conclusion:  the present study was indicated that the common organisms in acute maxillary sinusitis were haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus viridians which were similar to a previous study. but the authors found an increased prevalence of anaerobe bacteria in acute maxillary sinusitis and also found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, 21.4% hemophilus influenzae less than the previous studies (which found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria around 50% to 70%). the authors found 23.3% anaerobe bacteria in the chronic maxillary sinusitis, less than the previous studies, and the authors also found 8.9% anaerobe in acute maxillary sinusitis.

TI  == bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  == blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in akwa ibom state and analyzed for the presence of salmonella species and other bacteria. of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. female subjects were more infected than males. the commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella paratyphi and salmonella typhi. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, k. aerogenes, s. faecalis, proteus mirabilis and p. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were s. aureus, e. coli, s. typhi, s. paratyphi, shigella sp, k. pneumoniae, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae 01. the isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. these antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. the results suggest the existence  of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. this is worrisome, since some of the s. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == potency and spectrum trends for cefepime tested against 65746 clinical bacterial  isolates collected in north american medical centers: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2003).
AB  == we evaluated the antimicrobial spectrum and potency of cefepime and selected comparators agents against clinical bacterial strains collected in north america  over a 6-year period (1998-2003). isolates were consecutively collected from bloodstream (44%), respiratory tract (41%), urinary tract (6%), and skin/soft tissue (5%) infections in 48 medical centers. isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were excluded from the analysis. imipenem (mic90 = 1 microg/ml, 99.9% susceptible) was the most active compound tested against enterobacteriaceae (22860 isolates tested) followed by cefepime (mic90 = 0.25 microg/ml, 99.5% susceptible) > amikacin (99.4% susceptible) > ceftriaxone (95.6% susceptible) > aztreonam (95.1% susceptible). among comparators, the lowest susceptibility rate for enterobacteriaceae was observed with ciprofloxacin (92.8% susceptible). imipenem was also the most active compound against esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli (99.3% and 100% susceptible, respectively), followed by amikacin (81.4% and 97.2% susceptible, respectively) and cefepime (92.5% and 93.8% susceptible, respectively). cefepime activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (85.2% susceptible) was similar to that of imipenem (86.9% susceptible). against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefepime (mic90 = 4 microg/ml, 100.0% susceptible) was 4-fold more active than ceftazidime (mic90 = 16 microg/ml, 86.4% susceptible) and showed a higher susceptibility rate than ciprofloxacin (93.2% susceptible). cefepime was the most active compound tested against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 1 microg/ml, 97.4% susceptible), ranked after gatifloxacin and levofloxacin (99.2% susceptible). the activity of cefepime remained stable during the study period evaluated with the susceptibility rates varying from 99.3% to 99.8% among the enterobacteriaceae and 84.4% to 88.4% among p. aeruginosa isolates. in summary, cefepime has retained broad activity and spectrum against enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and gram-positive cocci (except oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci) isolated from north american medical centers in the 1998-2003 period. continued resistance surveillance is critical to monitor the effectiveness of widely used parenteral antimicrobial agents such as cefepime.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
AB  == tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the  least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be  a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens  with varying resistance phenotypes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  == emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. in this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were haemophilus influenzae  (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (15.6%), klebsiella spp. (5.6%), s. pneumoniae (4.6%), acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.0%), escherichia coli (3.8%), serratia marcescens (2.5%), enterococcus spp. (2.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). at a concentration of 4 microg/ml, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, p. aeruginosa). s. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml. streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and s. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest mic being  0.12 microg/ml. all e. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml, and all klebsiella (25.8% esbl phenotype) and enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/ml. tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. and s. maltophilia strains (mic50 and mic90, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively). further clinical studies should consider the role that  tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.

TI  == tigecycline activity tested against 26,474 bloodstream infection isolates: a collection from 6 continents.
AB  == the activity of tigecycline (formerly gar936), a novel glycylcycline, was tested  against recent bloodstream infection (bsi) pathogen isolates from 6 continents. frequency of clinical occurrence of these pathogens was determined and their antibiograms assessed using reference broth microdilution methods. a total of 26474 strains were tested for tigecycline susceptibility according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for  clinical laboratory standards) by the m7-a6 guidelines with interpretations from  m100-s15 and the package insert. the rank order of pathogens was staphylococcus aureus (33.1%), escherichia coli (14.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13.5%), enterococcus spp. (12.3%), klebsiella spp. (5.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%), enterobacter spp. (3.0%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (2.9%),  streptococcus pneumoniae (2.3%), and viridans group streptococci (1.4%). tigecycline exhibited a broader spectrum of activity against bsi isolates when compared to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and many beta-lactams (imipenem). tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens tested, including staphylococci (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml), enterococci (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), streptococci (mic(90), < or =0.12 microg/ml), escherichia coli (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), klebsiella spp. (mic90, 1 mmicrog/ml), and enterobacter  spp. (mic(90), 2 mmicrog/ml), but showed limited inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 16 microg/ml) and indole-positive or indole-negative proteae (mic90, 4-8 microg/ml). in summary, tigecycline exhibited a wide spectrum of antimicrobial potency versus bsi isolates collected worldwide. serious infections in nosocomial environments should benefit from tigecycline use among the investigational phase 3 agents focused toward resistant strains.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3989 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the united states tigecycline evaluation and surveillance  trial (test program; 2004).
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) determined the in vitro activity of tigecycline over a large population of organisms from geographically diverse sites. tigecycline was compared to amikacin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline, piperacillin/tazobactam, linezolid, penicillin, and vancomycin against 3989 commonly encountered clinical gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected from sites in the united states during 2004. the tigecycline activity was equivalent to imipenem against enterobacteriaceae. tigecycline inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and ampc phenotypes at mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration) of < or =2 microg/ml. in vitro results for tigecycline were similar to other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against nonfermenters with mic90 results of 2 microg/ml against acinetobacter spp. and >16 microg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline demonstrated potent activity against staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml) and enterococci (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml) regardless of methicillin or vancomycin susceptibility. tigecycline mic values were unaffected by penicillin nonsusceptibility and beta-lactamase production among fastidious respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae [mic90, 0.5 microg/ml] and haemophilus influenzae [mic90, 0.25 microg/ml]). tigecycline offers excellent activity against most of the commonly encountered nosocomial and community-acquired bacterial pathogens.

TI  == the antibiotic treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonias (cap) are still caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, or moraxella catarrhalis. legionella and chlamydia pneumoniae have been defined as important atypical pathogens causing cap. klebsiella causes cap primarily in patients with chronic alcoholism or in chronic care facilities. normal hosts do not present with "unusual pathogens'' e.g., staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the clinical severity of a bacterial pneumonia has important prognostic implications and predicts admission  to intensive care units, duration of therapy, and complications. the factors that determine the severity of a cap are less related to the pathogen than the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient as well as the patient's humoral immunity. relatively avirulent pathogens may result in severe cap in patients with diminished/absent splenic function or significant cardiopulmonary disease. a critical concept is to appreciate that the selection of antimicrobial therapy is  not dependent on co-morbidities since the antimicrobial therapy is directed against the pathogen and not the co-morbidities. therefore the treatment of cap,  whether moderate or severe is with the same antibiotic at the same dose. many antibiotic regimens are equally efficacious in the treatment of cap. the most cost effective optimal regimen covers both typical and atypical pathogens, e.g.,  levofloxacin, and is currently the preferred antibiotic approach to moderate or severe cap in the ccu.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia complicating the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
AB  == pulmonary infections span a wide spectrum, ranging from self-limited processes (e.g., tracheobronchitis) to life-threatening infections including both community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap). together, pneumonia and influenza rank as the sixth leading cause of death in the united states and lead all other infectious diseases in this respect. pneumonia is the second-most-common hospital-acquired infection in the united states, accounting for 17.8% of all hospital-acquired infections and 40,000 to 70,000 deaths per year. hap is the most common nosocomial infection occurring in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, developing in 6.5% of patients after 10 days and in 28% of patients after 30 days of ventilatory support. patients acquiring hap have a greater risk of mortality than comparably ill ventilated patients who do not develop pneumonia. ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) specifically refers to a bacterial pneumonia developing in patients with acute respiratory failure who have been receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. the etiologic bacteriologic agents associated with vap typically differ based on the timing of the occurrence of the infection relative to the start of mechanical ventilation. vap occurring within 96 hours of the onset of mechanical  ventilation is usually due to antibiotic-sensitive bacteria that colonize the patient prior to hospital admission (e.g., streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus  influenza, oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus). vap developing after 96 hours of ventilatory support is more often associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria including oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter species and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, more recent data suggest that hospitalization and exposure to antibiotics prior to the start of mechanical ventilation are important risk factors for the occurrence of vap attributed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. therefore, these risk factors should be considered when deciding on an appropriate empiric antibiotic regimen regardless of the onset of vap. vap and catheter-associated bloodstream infections are the leading  causes of infection acquired in the intensive care unit (icu) setting. patients in the icu have rates of hap that are as much as five to ten times higher than the rates in general hospital wards. additionally, like nosocomial bloodstream infections, vap is associated with an attributable mortality beyond that accounted for by patients' severity of illness. the attributable mortality associated with vap appears to be greatest for "high-risk'' antibiotic-resistant  bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus. the greater hospital mortality associated with these "high-risk'' pathogens has been attributed to the virulence of these bacteria and the increased occurrence of inadequate initial antibiotic treatment of vap due to the presence of antibiotic resistance. this review provides an overview of the clinical importance of vap. we then describe how this nosocomial infection influences the management and outcomes of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards).

AB  == background: the bact/alert (biomerieux) system is highly efficient for bacterial  detection in apheresis platelets (plts) and whole blood-derived plts produced by  the buffy-coat method. detection of bacterial contamination in whole blood-derived plts produced by the plt-rich plasma (prp) method, however, is problematic. prestorage pooling of these plts is not permitted in some countries  including canada and the united states, and culturing individual units is costly  and may significantly reduce the plt unit content. in this study, the sensitivity and specificity of bact/alert cultures performed on pools derived from prp plts are reported. study design and methods: the sensitivity of the bact/alert system  was evaluated for bacterial detection in prp plts with a dilution effect. thirty  plt pools were produced with 1 plt unit previously spiked with bacteria and then  pooled with other four nonspiked plt units. three bacteria, usually associated with plt contamination, were selected for spiking. the specificity of this method was evaluated in 40 nonspiked plt pools. results: the method was found to be 100  percent specific and 97 percent sensitive. of the five spiked pools with streptococcus pneumoniae at levels of less than 2 colony-forming units (cfus) per ml, four were found to be positive whereas all 25 spiked pools with greater than  9 cfus per ml of any of the chosen bacteria gave positive results. the mean time  of detection was 17 to 19 hours for staphylococcus epidermidis and 14 to 15 hours for s. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa when spiked with similar bacterial inocula. conclusion: the evaluated system is highly sensitive and specific and may be a feasible method for bacterial detection in prp plts.

AB  == new antimicrobial agents are urgently needed for clinical use due to the increasing prevalence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria that are commonly responsible for serious and life-threatening diseases. the need to develop new agents that effectively overcome existing mechanisms of resistance displayed by bacteria resistant to currently available drugs has become paramount. tigecycline, the first in a new class of antimicrobials, the glycylcyclines, is an analogue of minocycline with additional properties that negate most mechanisms mediating resistance to the tetracyclines. in vitro testing has revealed that tigecycline has activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and many species of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, although resistance to tigecycline by pseudomonas aeruginosa and reduced susceptibility among proteus species do occur. tigecycline is being evaluated in multicentre phase iii clinical trials for therapy of many serious and life-threatening infections in which multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms  may be found. tigecycline appears to hold promise as a novel expanded spectrum antibiotic.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == the fixed combination of fortified vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solution--va solution: in vitro study of the potency and stability.
AB  == purpose: we compared the in vitro potency and stability of a fixed combination of vancomycin and amikacin solution (va solution) with amikacin or vancomycin solution. methods: solutions of 2% amikacin (20 mg/ml) and of 5% vancomycin (50 mg/ml) and va solution (each 1 ml contained 20 mg of amikacin and 50 mg of vancomycin) were prepared from parenteral antibiotics by reconstituting them with sterile injection water and refrigerated (4 degrees c) in the dark. triplicate 5-ml portions of each solution were tested before storage and 7 and 14 days after preparation for potency of antimicrobial activity by the disk diffusion method and for stability. results: there were no significant differences in the diameter of zones of inhibition of va solution compared with amikacin or vancomycin solution within a 2-week period. visual inspection revealed that all solutions remained clear, colorless, and particle-free at 4 degrees c throughout the study  period. for osmolarity, the va solution was much higher than that of either amikacin or vancomycin solution at all tested times and more near the well-tolerated range of human eyes. there were no significant differences at days 0, 7, or 14 for either vancomycin, amikacin, or va solution. for ph, the va solution was higher than that of vancomycin solution (nearly equal to that of amikacin solution) at each time and more near the level of normal tear film. the  ph did not differ significantly for either vancomycin, amikacin, or va solution at all tested times. conclusions: the vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solutions can be mixed together with the same potency and stable physical properties. it may be useful in the treatment of bacterial keratitis pending clinical trials to determine its effectiveness and safety.

TI  == evaluation of negative results of bact/alert 3d automated blood culture system.
AB  == although automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are both rapid and sensitive, false-positive and false-negative results still occur. the objective of this study, then, was to evaluate negative results occurring with bact/alert 3d blood culture systems. a total of 1032 samples were cultured with the bact/alert 3d automated blood culture system, using both aerobic (fa) and anaerobic (fn) [corrected] media, and 128 of these samples yielded positive results. a total of 904 negative blood samples were then subcultured in 5% sheep  blood agar, eosin methylene blue, chocolate agar, and sabouraud-dextrose agar. organisms growing on these subcultures were subsequently identified using both vitek32 (biomerieux, durham, nc) and conventional methods. twenty four (2.6%) of  the 904 subcultures grew on the subculture media. the majority (83.3%) of these were determined to be gram-positive microorganisms. fourteen (58.3%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, two (8.3%) were bacillus spp., one (4.2%) was staphylococcus aureus, and one (4.2%) was identified as enterococcus faecium. streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria spp. were isolated together in two (8.3%)  vials. gram-negative microorganisms comprised 12.5% of the subcultures, of which  two (8.3%) were found to be pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one (4.2%) was pseudomonas fluorescens. the other isolate (4.2%) was identified as candida albicans. we conclude that the subculture of negative results is valuable in the  bact/alert 3d system, especially in situations in which only one set of blood cultures is taken.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == insight into the self-association of key enzymes from pathogenic species.
AB  == self-association of protein monomers to higher-order oligomers plays an important role in a plethora of biological phenomena. the classical biophysical technique of analytical ultracentrifugation is a key method used to measure protein oligomerisation. recent advances in sedimentation data analysis have enabled the  effects of diffusion to be deconvoluted from sample heterogeneity, permitting the direct identification of oligomeric species in self-associating systems. two such systems are described and reviewed in this study. first, we examine the enzyme dihydrodipicolinate synthase (dhdps), which crystallises as a tetramer. wild-type dhdps plays a critical role in lysine biosynthesis in microbes and is therefore an important antibiotic target. to confirm the state of association of dhdps in solution, we employed sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies in an analytical ultracentrifuge to show that dhdps exists in a slow dimer-tetramer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of 76 nm. second, we review works describing the hexamerisation of gdp-mannose pyrophosphorylase (gdp-mp), an enzyme that plays a critical role in mannose metabolism in leishmania species. although the structure of the gdp-mp hexamer has not yet been determined, we describe a three-dimensional model of the hexamer based largely on homology with the uridyltransferase enzyme, glmu. gdp-mp is a novel drug target for the treatment of leishmaniasis, a devastating parasitic disease that infects  more than 12 million people worldwide. given that both gdp-mp and dhdps are only  active in their oligomeric states, we propose that inhibition of the self-association of critical enzymes in disease is an emerging paradigm for therapeutic intervention.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north india.
AB  == bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. in this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to government medical college and hospital, chandigarh, india, over a period of 1 year from august 2003 to july 2004. among the 567 qualifying samples, pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), escherichia coli (15.17%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and salmonella enterica serovar typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria other than citrobacter, acinetobacter, proteus, and enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated gram-positive bacteria other than other streptococcus and staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. however, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all  gram-negative isolates. for gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against staphylococcus spp. combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for gram-negative pathogens. hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == investigation of the susceptibility trends in japan to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates: a longitudinal analysis from 1994 to 2002.
AB  == the susceptibilities of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and other antimicrobial agents were surveyed to obtain an accurate understanding of the trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance. the samples were collected from across japan, biennially, between 1994 and 2002 and a defined level of resistance to fq determined. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae exhibited stable and high rates of susceptibility to fq over the period examined. for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus the rate of resistance to fq was 80%-90%, markedly higher than that of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus. the rate of fq-resistant escherichia coli increased rapidly to approximately 10% for samples after 2000. of 696 e. coli isolates collected in 2002, 13 produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl), with 6 of 13 esbl-producing isolates being fq-resistant. no fq resistance in clinical isolates of salmonella spp. was  detected in any of the surveys. the rate of fq resistance to pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract and respiratory tract infections was 40%-60% and 15%-25%, respectively.

TI  == defining the need for new antimicrobials: clinical and economic implications of resistance in the hospitalised patient.
AB  == resistance among pathogens causing the most common infections encountered in hospitalised patients is increasing. due to this resistance, the clinical efficacy of current antimicrobial agents is decreasing against many pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus,  vancomycin-resistant enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and ampc beta-lactamase-producing organisms. studies assessing the impact of these resistance mechanisms on clinical outcomes have been performed; however, studies determining the economic impact of resistance have been limited. strategies to retain the clinical efficacy of currently available agents include the initiation of antimicrobials with efficacy against the suspected pathogen(s) based on data obtained from local antibiograms, the use of  combination therapy, and pharmacodynamic optimisation. once a broad-spectrum regimen has been initiated, de-escalation to narrow, targeted antimicrobial therapy based on susceptibility data is warranted. despite these efforts, new antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action are eagerly anticipated to extend  the current armamentarium against the growing population of multi-drug-resistant  pathogens.

TI  == microbiology and antimicrobial management of sinusitis.
AB  == sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation  of the upper respiratory tract. the bacterial pathogens in acute sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis, while anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters, or are intubated. many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. aureus, fusobacterium spp., and prevotella spp) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (s. pneumoniae). the pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to  cause infections, and indirectly through the production of betalactamase. the indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but  also by 'shielding' penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. the direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. the antimicrobials that are the most effective in  management of acute sinusitis are amoxycillin-clavulanate (given in a high dose), the newer quinolones (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) and the second generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefprozil or cefdinir). the antimicrobials that are the most effective in management of chronic sinusitis are amoxycillinclavulanate, clindamycin and the combination of metronidazole and a penicillin.

TI  == guide to selection of fluoroquinolones in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == newer fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and gemifloxacin have several attributes that make them excellent choices for the therapy of lower respiratory tract infections. in particular, they have excellent intrinsic activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens. fluoroquinolones may be used as monotherapy to treat high-risk patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring  hospitalisation, but not admission to intensive care. overall, the newer fluoroquinolones often achieve clinical cure rates in > or =90% of these patients. however, rates may be lower in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this infection should be treated on the basis of anticipated organisms and evaluation  of risk factors for specific pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this setting, an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone may be used in combination with an antipseudomonalbeta-lactam. concerns are now being raised about the widespread use, and possibly misuse, of fluoroquinolones and the emergence of resistance among s. pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. a number of pharmacokinetic parameters such as the peak concentration of the antibacterial after a dose (c(max)), and the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (auc24) and their relationship to pharmacodynamic parameters such as the minimum  inhibitory and the mutant prevention concentrations (mic and mpc, respectively) have been proposed to predict the effect of fluoroquinolones on bacterial killing and the emergence of resistance. higher c(max)/mic or auc24/mic and c(max)/mpc or auc24/mpc ratios, either as a result of dose administration or the susceptibility of the organism, may lead to a better clinical outcome and decrease the emergence of resistance, respectively. pharmacokinetic profiles that are optimised to target low-level resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria that often exist in infections may help preserve fluoroquinolones as a class. to this end, optimising the auc24/mpc or c(max)/mpc ratios is important, particularly against s. pneumoniae, in the setting of lower respiratory tract infections. agents such as  moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin with high ratios against this organism are preferred, and agents such as ciprofloxacin with low ratios should be avoided. for agents such as levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, with intermediate ratios against s. pneumoniae, it may be worthwhile considering alternative dose administration strategies, such as using higher dosages, to eradicate low-level resistant variants. this must, of course, be balanced against the potential of toxicity. innovative approaches to the use of fluoroquinolones are worth testing  in further in vitro experiments as well as in clinical trials.

TI  == control of bacterial pneumonia during mechanical ventilation.
AB  == pneumonia complicates the course of 50% of patients on mechanical ventilation, requiring three or more days of mechanical ventilation and potentially increasing the relative risk of mortality by 20-40%. the predominant potentially pathogenic  micro-organisms are streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (sensitive to methicillin in the previously healthy host), pseudomonas aeruginosa (aerobic gram-negative bacilli), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in the host with underlying disease. approximately 85% of pneumonias are endogenous, caused by bacteria present in the patient's oropharyngeal flora. bacteria present on admission cause primary endogenous pneumonia (55%), whereas bacteria acquired  in the unit lead to supercarriage or secondary carriage and subsequently secondary endogenous pneumonia (30%). the remaining 15% are exogenous, ie the bacteria causing pneumonia are not carried by the patient. the diagnosis is usually based on clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria, using the  non-invasive method of tracheal aspirate, which yields >/=10(5) micro-organisms.  seven randomized trials have evaluated three non-antibiotic prophylactic maneuvers: hygiene (1 trial), subglottic drainage (4 trials), and semirecumbent position (2 trials). the impact on pneumonia was mixed, whereas mortality was unchanged. selective digestive decontamination, using parenteral and enteral antimicrobials to control the three types of pneumonia, has been evaluated in 54  trials and showed an absolute mortality reduction of 8%. the therapy of pneumonia relies on six basic principles: (a) surveillance and diagnostic cultures to identify micro-organisms; (b) immediate and adequate antibiotic treatment to sterilize the lower airways, (c) the source of potential pathogens requires elimination for recovery of the original infection and prevention of relapses and/or superinfections; (d) aerosolized antimicrobials; (e) removal or replacement of the endotracheal tube; and (f) surveillance samples are indispensable to monitor efficacy of treatment. the aim of our review was to evaluate up to date facts regarding control of bacterial pneumonias during mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit settings.

AB  == background: inherited interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase-4 (irak-4) deficiency is a recently described immunodeficiency associated with pyogenic bacterial infections and a poor inflammatory response. shigella sonnei is generally associated with outbreaks of rectocolitis in developed countries, but systemic illnesses have occasionally been reported. an underlying primary immunodeficiency has not been found in such cases before now. methods: we report  the clinical and immunological features of a patient with irak-4 deficiency who has a history of systemic shigellosis in addition to other infections. results: the patient has a history of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections during childhood and an episode of s. sonnei septicemia and meningitis at 10 years of age. this patient's history contrasted with that of other individuals infected concurrently by the same organism. of note, these episodes were not accompanied by acute phase responses in our patient. subsequently, the patient has had more episodes of staphylococcal disease, but no systemic illnesses. the patient is now 30 years old and has been  doing well since prophylactic antibiotic treatment was stopped 4 years ago. discussion: to our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of systemic shigellosis in a person with a primary immunodeficiency, expanding the spectrum of infections associated with irak-4 deficiency. thus, immunity mediated by irak-4 seems to be crucial for both the containment of and the inflammatory response to s. sonnei infection in the intestinal mucosa. irak-4 deficiency and related disorders should be considered in patients with systemic shigellosis.

TI  == minimizing the release of proinflammatory and toxic bacterial products within the host: a promising approach to improve outcome in life-threatening infections.
AB  == various bacterial components (e.g., endotoxin, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycans, dna) induce or enhance inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system and/or are directly toxic in eukariotic cells (e.g., hemolysins). when antibiotics which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis kill bacteria, smaller quantities of proinflammatory or toxic compounds are released in vitro and in vivo than during killing of bacteria by beta-lactams and other cell-wall active drugs. in general, high antibiotic concentrations liberate lower quantities of bacterial proinflammatory or toxic compounds than concentrations close to the minimum inhibitory concentration. in animal models of escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus peritonitis/sepsis and of streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, a lower release of proinflammatory bacterial compounds was associated with a reduced mortality or neuronal injury. pre-treatment with a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor reduced the strong release of bacterial products usually observed during treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic. data available strongly encourage clinical trials comparing antibiotic regimens with different release of proinflammatory/toxic bacterial products. the benefit of the approach to reduce the liberation of bacterial products should be greatest in patients with a high bacterial load.

TI  == statistical assessment of a laboratory method for growing biofilms.
AB  == microbial biofilms have been grown in laboratories using a variety of different approaches. a laboratory biofilm reactor system, called the cdc biofilm reactor (cbr) system, has been devised for growing biofilms under moderate to high fluid  shear stress. the reactor incorporates 24 removable biofilm growth surfaces (coupons) for sampling and analysing the biofilm. following preliminary experiments to verify the utility of the cbr system for growing biofilms of several clinically relevant organisms, a standard operating procedure for growing a pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm was created. this paper presents the results of  a rigorous, intra-laboratory, statistical evaluation of the repeatability and ruggedness of that procedure as well as the results of the experiments with clinically relevant organisms. for the statistical evaluations, the outcome of interest was the density (c.f.u. cm(-2)) of viable p. aeruginosa. replicate experiments were conducted to assess the repeatability of the log density outcome. the mean p. aeruginosa log10 density was 7.1, independent of the coupon  position within the reactor. the repeatability standard deviation of the log density based on one coupon per experiment was 0.59. analysis of variance showed  that the variability of the log density was 53 % attributable to within-experiment sources and 47 % attributable to between-experiments sources. the ruggedness evaluation applied response-surface design and regression analysis techniques, similar to those often used for sensitivity analyses in other fields  of science and engineering. this approach provided a quantitative description of  ruggedness; specifically, the amount the log density was altered by small adjustments to four key operational factors--time allowed for initial surface colonization, temperature, nutrient concentration, and fluid shear stress on the  biofilm. the small size of the regression coefficient associated with each operational factor showed that the method was rugged; that is, relatively insensitive to minor perturbations of the four factors. these results demonstrate that the cbr system is a reliable experimental tool for growing a standard biofilm in the laboratory and that it can be adapted to study several different micro-organisms.

TI  == complications of mastoiditis in children at the onset of a new millennium.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to review our recent experience in the diagnosis and treatment of acute mastoiditis and its complications in a single tertiary-care, university-affiliated pediatric center. ninety-eight children with 101 episodes of acute mastoiditis were included in the study. the mean interval from onset of illness to mastoiditis was 4.5 days. ear cultures most often grew streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.7% each). complications occurred in 15.8% of episodes. the only factor differentiating children with and  without complications was white blood cell count. these findings indicate that acute mastoiditis not only is a complication of prolonged infection of the middle ear, but may also present as an acute infection of the mastoid bone that can progress within 48 hours. the complication rate remains high, and antibiotic treatment at the onset of symptoms does not prevent complications. a high white blood cell count on admission may serve as a predictive factor of complicated cases.

TI  == augmentation of the bactericidal activities of human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37-derived antimicrobial peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  == objective: mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such as defensins and cathelicidins) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading micro-organisms. among these, human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37 (l1-s37) possesses potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, to develop peptide derivatives with improved bactericidal actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (k15-v32) of ll-37 as a template, and evaluated the activities of  modified peptides. methods: antibacterial activities of the peptides (0.022 approximately 4.4 microm corresponding to 0.1 approximately 10 microg/ml) were assessed by alamarblue assay using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as target organisms. furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities of the peptides were examined by using e. coli ml-35p as a target. results: by substituting e16 and k25 with two l residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (18-mer ll) was increased, and by further substituting q22, d26 and n30 with three k residues, the cationicity of the peptide (18-mer llkkk) was enhanced. among peptide derivatives, 18-mer llkkk exhibited the most potent antibacterial actions against s. aureus (methicillin-resistant and -sensitive), s. pneumoniae,  s. pyogenes, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, and possessed the most powerful membrane-permeabilizing activities against e. coli ml-35p at the effective concentrations (p <0.05, 18-mer llkkk vs. 18-mer ll, 18-mer k15-v32 and ll-37). conclusions: bactericidal activities of the amphipathic human cap18/ll-37-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and cationicity,  and 18-mer llkkk is the most potent among peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.

TI  == bacteriology in patients with chronic sinusitis who have been medically and surgically treated.
AB  == chronic sinusitis is a disease that afflicts a significant percentage of the population and causes considerable long-term morbidity. the common use of multiple broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and endoscopic sinus surgery to treat this condition may alter the pathogenes that promote persistence of chronic sinusitis. forty-eight culture-positive patients with chronic sinusitis who had been medically treated for at least 3 months and had undergone sinus surgery were bacteriologically evaluated. swab specimens of the middle meatus and sphenoethmoid recess were aseptically obtained endoscopically and cultured for aerobes. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates (45.8%),  followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (16.7%), enterobacteriaceae (16.7%), staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.4%). coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated organisms in our study, as in many other studies. despite the significant predominance of these organisms, they have always been assumed to be contaminants, and their presence in culture has been discounted. coagulase-negative s aureus may be a pathogen in the chronic sinusitis process, and sensitivities of this isolate should be obtained for evaluation and possible treatment of the disease.

TI  == the newer guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is a leading cause of death in the world and the sixth most common cause of death in the united states. it is the number one cause of death from infectious diseases in the united states. this article reviews the latest available guidelines from two leading organizations-the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) and the american thoracic society (ats). the idsa stratifies patients into three categories and recommends antibiotic management based on assigned categories: outpatients, patients admitted to a general medical floor (gmf), and patients requiring intensive care  unit (icu) admission. the ats, in contrast, stratifies patients into four major groups based on the presence of two cardiopulmonary diseases, certain modifying risk factors that increase the likelihood of acquiring specific infections (such  as with drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, enteric gram-negative organisms, or pseudomonas aeruginosa), and also based on the site of treatment (such as outpatient setting, gmf, and icu).

TI  == [efflux-mediated antibiotics resistance in bacteria].
AB  == bacteria can resist to antibiotics by active exportation mediated by membrane transporters called efflux pumps. these proteins can be specific of a class of antibiotics or responsible for multidrug resistance (mdr). energy required by efflux pumps can be provided by transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons (mfs, rnd, smr families) or sodium ions (mate family) or by atp hydrolysis (abc family). several physiological functions have been described in prokaryotes, such as protection from environmental toxics and regulation of cell homeostasis, which can indirectly contributes to bacterial virulence. in gram-negative bacteria, efflux transporters usually are organized as multicomponent systems in which the  efflux pump located in the inner membrane works in conjunction with a periplasmic fusion protein and an outer membrane factor. the most frequently encountered pumps are of the rnd-type such as acrb in escherichia coli or mexb in pseudomonas aeruginosa. in gram-positive bacteria, efflux is solely mediated by the pump protein, so described with mfs pumps such as nora or qaca in staphylococcus aureus and pmra in streptococcus pneumoniae. efflux transporters have also been described in mycobacteria. although numerous bacterial pumps have been characterized, the clinical consequences of efflux-mediated resistance are mostly unknown because of variable levels of expression and of the lack of specific markers in laboratory practice. finally, associating pump-specific inhibitors to  efflux-sensitive antibiotics might prove an interesting therapeutic perspective.  however, inhibitors that are not toxic to eukaryotic cells remain to be identified.

TI  == role of efflux mechanisms on fluoroquinolone resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == prokaryotic efflux mechanisms can effectively increase the intrinsic resistance of bacteria by actively transporting antibiotics out of cells, thus reducing the  effective concentration of these agents. the fluoroquinolones, similar to most other antimicrobial classes, are susceptible to efflux mechanisms, particularly in gram-negative organisms, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. resistant p. aeruginosa clones isolated after fluoroquinolone therapy frequently over express  at least one of the multiple efflux pump mechanisms found in this organism. gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, also possess efflux mechanisms, though their effect on fluoroquinolone resistance seems to be more limited and selective. in the future, efflux pump inhibitors may offer effective  adjunctive therapy to antibiotics for the treatment of difficult infections by efflux mutants. in the meantime, appropriate antibiotic selection and optimal dosing strategies should aim to eradicate the causative pathogen before a resistant efflux mutant can emerge.

AB  == owing to the predominance of gram-positive pathogens in neutropenic cancer patients, newer generation quinolones with an expanded gram-positive spectrum and enhanced potency, may have a role to play for prophylaxis and/or empiric therapy  in such patients. the in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trovafloxacin against 848 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. against gram-positive organisms, gatifloxacin was  the most active agent tested inhibiting all aerococcus, listeria monocytogens, micrococcus, stomatococcus mucilaginous, bacillus, and rhodococcus equi strains at < or =2 mg/l, its designated susceptibility breakpoint. it was also very active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus spp. (including penicillin nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci). it had moderate activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, inhibiting 68-80% of these strains at <  or =2 mg/l. gatifloxacin also had good activity against the enterobacteriaceae (although ciprofloxacin was more potent) inhibiting >95% of isolates at < or =1 mg/l. nonfermentative gram-negative organisms were less susceptible to all 4 agents. gatifloxacin was very active against acinetobacter lwoffi (mic100 0.12 mg/l) and had moderate activity against acinetobacter baumanii, chryseobacterium  spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas  species. alcaligenes xylosoxidans strains were relatively resistant to all 4 agents.

AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == prulifloxacin.
AB  == prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. after absorption, prulifloxacin is metabolised by esterases to ulifloxacin. the drug has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. ulifloxacin is generally more active in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against a variety of clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria, including community and nosocomial isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus, providencia and morganella spp., moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus spp. the activity of ulifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa varies between countries. gram-positive organisms, including meticillin- or oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and italian community isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae are  susceptible to ulifloxacin. activity against spanish strains of s. pneumoniae is  moderate. in well designed clinical trials, good clinical and bacteriological efficacy (similar to that of ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or pefloxacin) was seen with prulifloxacin 600 mg once daily for 10 days in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or complicated lower urinary tract infections (utis), and with single-dose prulifloxacin 600 mg in acute, uncomplicated lower utis. prulifloxacin was generally well tolerated in clinical  trials, with a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens.
AB  == the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by gram-positive bacteria and carbapenem resistance by gram-negative bacteria has rendered some hospital-acquired pathogens impossible to treat. the resistance mechanisms employed are sophisticated and very difficult to overcome. unless alternative treatment regimes are initiated soon, our inability to treat totally resistant bacteria will halt other developments in medicine. in the community, gram-positive bacteria responsible for pneumonia could become totally resistant leading to increased mortality from this common infection, which would have a more immediate impact on our current lifestyles.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == immunomodulation and sepsis: impact of the pathogen.
AB  == infection begins when microorganisms overcome host barriers and multiply within host tissues. to contain the infection, the host mounts an inflammatory response  that mobilizes defense systems and kills the invading microorganisms. a focal inflammatory response is usually sufficient to eradicate the organisms. however,  when it fails to contain the infection, the organisms, their toxins, and numerous host mediators are released into the bloodstream, producing a systemic inflammatory response and organ failure. microorganisms have coevolved with their hosts, thereby acquiring means of overcoming host defense mechanisms or even taking advantage of innate host responses. many pathogens avoid recognition by the host or dampen host immune responses via sophisticated pathogen-host interactions. some pathogens benefit from the inflammatory response. according to current hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of sepsis, the host generates both  an innate immune response identical for all pathogens and an adaptive pathogen-specific response. determining whether the innate response benefits the  pathogen or the host is essential for understanding host-pathogen interactions. in this review, we discuss how pathogens interfere with innate and adaptive immune responses to escape eradication by the host.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2002)].
AB  == from october 2002 to september 2003, we collected the specimen from 476 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. of 584 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 578 strains were examined. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 77, streptococcus pneumoniae 103, haemophilus influenzae 95, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 61, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 23, klebsiella pneumoniae 36, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 29, etc. of 77 s. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of mic of oxacillin (mpipc) [methicillin-susceptible s. aureus: mssa] was 34 strains (44.2%) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) was 43 strains (55.8%). against mssa, imipenem (ipm) and minocycline (mino) had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. although clindamycin (cldm) and aminoglycosides also had the potent activity, the resistant strains against those agents were detected. cefotiam (ctm) inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml without the low sensitive strains. against mrsa, vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. arbekacin (abk) also showed the relatively potent activity and inhibited the growth of all  the strains at 4 microg/ml. carbapenems showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml.  cefozopran (czop) also had a preferable activity (mic90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. in contrast, the resistant strains for cefaclor (ccl), erythromycin (em), cldm, and tetracycline (tc) were detected in 50.5%, 76.7%, 50.5%, and 80.6% of all the strains, respectively. against h. influenzae, lvfx showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 92 of all the strains (96.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. the antibacterial activity of czop was good and its mic90 against mucoid and non-mucoid strains was 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. czop and cefpirome (cpr) were the most potent against k. pneumoniae with 0.125 microg/ml of mic90. also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis and the mic90 of all drugs were 4 microg/ml or less. the approximately half the number (47.5%) of the patients with respiratory infection  were aged 70 years or older. as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 35.7 and 33.8%  of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. pneumoniae (22.6%). in contrast, s. aureus (16.6%) and p. aeruginosa (13.7%) were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were h. influenzae (24.5%) and s. pneumoniae (24.2%). in comparison of the isolated bacteria by pretreatment agents, p. aeruginosa was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with cephems or macrolides and h. influenzae was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with penicillins.

TI  == toll-like receptor 2-dependent bacterial sensing does not occur via peptidoglycan recognition.
AB  == toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) has been shown to recognize several classes of pathogen-associated molecular patterns including peptidoglycan (pg). however, studies linking pg with tlr2 recognition have relied mainly on the use of commercial staphylococcus aureus pg and have not addressed tlr2 recognition of other pg types. using highly purified pgs from eight bacteria (escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, helicobacter pylori, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and s. aureus), we show that these pgs are not sensed through tlr2, tlr2/1 or tlr2/6. pg sensing is lost after removal of lipoproteins or lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from gram-negative and gram-positive cell walls, respectively. accordingly, purified ltas are sensed synergistically through tlr2/1. finally, we show that elicited peritoneal murine macrophages do not produce tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-6 in response to purified pgs, suggesting that pg detection is more likely to occur intracellularly (through nod1/nod2) rather than from the extracellular compartment.

TI  == the role of pk/pd parameters to avoid selection and increase of resistance: mutant prevention concentration.
AB  == the continuing escalation of antimicrobial resistant human pathogens and the limited number of new antimicrobial agents under development has dictated that our knowledge on the emergence of resistance and any potential strategies to slow the rate at which resistance occurs is of paramount importance. investigations with fluoroquinolones resulted in the mutant prevention concentration (mpc) concept which represents a novel in vitro measurement of fluoroquinolone potency. in essence, the mpc defines the antimicrobial drug concentration threshold that would require an organism to simultaneously possess two resistance mutations for  growth in the presence of the drug. an alternative definition is the drug concentration that prevents the growth of first-step resistant mutants or the minimal inhibitory concentration of the most resistant organism present in the heterogeneous bacterial population when tested against > or =10(9) organisms. from in vitro investigations, the new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin) were all found to have lower mpc values than did levofloxacin against clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae. ciprofloxacin was found to have lower mpc values than levofloxacin against clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. when mpc data is applied to achievable and sustainable serum drug concentrations in the body, estimation of the time the serum drug concentration exceed both mic and mpc values can be determined. this data along with kill data allows for an estimate of the amount of time drug concentration needs to exceed mic/mpc values to not only result in significant kill but also to minimize resistance development. to date, mpc measurements have been determined in in vitro microbiological and pharmacological models and animal and human data  are being investigated. the data summarized in this overview detail resistance issues for p. aeruginosa, s. pneumoniae and other pathogens. also presented is a  summary of the mpc concept and investigations completed to date. a brief summary  of fluoroquinolone mechanisms of action and resistance is presented. finally, some preliminary investigations with other classes of compounds are discussed. to date, very limited data is available to conclude if the mpc concept does or does  not apply to other classes of antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the bact/alert fa-medium was evaluated to detect pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood samples. as published previously its predecessor the bact/alert fan-medium failed to detect p. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples. it is now reported that fa-medium tolerates a longer pre-incubation period at 36 degrees c, i.e. 8 h, before detection of p. aeruginosa fails in experimentally inoculated blood cultures. in clinical blood samples the frequency of false-negative results concerning p. aeruginosa was reduced from 46.9 % (fan-medium) to 9.1 % (fa-medium). if media inoculated with p. aeruginosa are pre-incubated at room temperature for 24 h, false-negative results are not observed. various micro-organisms (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, candida glabrata) were recognized after pre-incubation at room temperature with similar sensitivity compared to pre-incubation at 36 degrees c. it is concluded that fa-medium detects p. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples with increased sensitivity and pre-incubation at room temperature is superior to pre-incubation  at 36 degrees c.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == we established a mouse model in which fatal pneumonia was induced by pneumococcal superinfection following influenza virus infection in chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa infected mice. in this mouse model, influenza virus infection caused a significant increase in inflammatory cells, cytokines and severe tissue damage in the lungs of these p. aeruginosa infected mice, before pneumococcal infection. intrapulmonary virus titres were significantly increased in mice with chronic p.  aeruginosa infection, compared with control mice. neutrophil function analysis showed significant reduction of myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity and lysozyme secretion by influenza virus infection in these mice. our results suggest that influenza virus infection may play an important role in inducing pneumococcal pneumonia in chronic p. aeruginosa infected mice. our results suggested that our  mouse model is useful for investigating the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in patients with chronic lung infection.

TI  == guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia in the icu.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia remains a common and serious condition worldwide. severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring icu admission is a distinct entity  with different pathogens, outcomes, and management. the mortality rate in severe  community-acquired pneumonia can be more than 50%. over the past decade, some international guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia have  been developed in an attempt to optimize patient care. these guidelines have developed prediction tools to direct clinicians in the management of community-acquired pneumonia, including when to admit a patient to the icu and selecting appropriate investigations and antimicrobial therapy. the individual recommendations of these guidelines and the guidelines as a whole require further studies.

TI  == rates of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens causing respiratory, blood, urine, and skin and soft tissue infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the usa, canada, germany, france, and italy were studied using the the surveillance network (tsn) database. among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (mic>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (italy) to 36.2% (usa); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (germany) to 63.8% (france). the prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae  among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (italy and germany) to 38.4% (usa). among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  ranged from 7.2% (canada and germany) to 27.3% (italy). the prevalence of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (germany and france) to 29.6% (italy). with the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with mrsa, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. meropenem was  the most effective agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. low  levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability  of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

TI  == [the history of the development and changes of quinolone antibacterial agents].
AB  == the quinolones, especially the new quinolones (the 6-fluoroquinolones), are the synthetic antibacterial agents to rival the beta-lactam and the macrolide antibacterials for impact in clinical usage in the antibacterial therapeutic field. they have a broad antibacterial spectrum of activity against gram-positive, gram-negative and mycobacterial pathogens as well as anaerobes. further, they show good-to-moderate oral absorption and tissue penetration with favorable pharmacokinetics in humans resulting in high clinical efficacy in the treatment of many kinds of infections. they also exhibit excellent safety profiles as well as those of oral beta-lactam antibiotics. the bacterial effects  of quinolones inhibit the function of bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv.  the history of the development of the quinolones originated from nalidixic acid (na), developed in 1962. in addition, the breakthrough in the drug design for the scaffold and the basic side chains have allowed improvements to be made to the first new quinolone, norfloxacin (nflx), patented in 1978. although currently more than 10,000 compounds have been already synthesized in the world, only two percent of them were developed and tested in clinical studies. furthermore, out of all these compounds, only twenty have been successfully launched into the market. in this paper, the history of the development and changes of the quinolones are described from the first quinolone, na, via, the first new quinolone (6-fluorinated quinolone) nflx, to the latest extended-spectrum quinolone antibacterial agents against multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. na has only modest activity against gram-negative bacteria and low oral absorption, therefore a suitable candidate for treatment of systemic infections (utis) is required. since the original discovery of na, a series of quinolones, which are referred to as the old quinolones, have been developed leading to the first new quinolone, nflx, with moderate improvements in over all properties starting in 1962 through and continuing throughout the 1970's. especially, the drug design for pipemidic acid (ppa) indicated one of the important breakthroughs that lead to nflx. the introduction of a piperazinyl group, which ia a basic moiety at the c7-position of the quinolone nuclei, improved activity against gram-negative organisms broadening the spectrum to include pseudomonas aeruginosa. ppa also showed soem activity against gram-positive bac teria. the basic piperazine ring, which can form the zwitterionic natrure with the carboxylic acid at the c3-position, has subsequently been shown to increase the ability of the drugs to penetrate the bacterial cells resulting in enhanced activity. further, the zwitterionic forms resulted in significant tissue penetration in the pharmacokinetics. on the other hand, the first compound with a fluorine atom at the c6-position of the related quinolone scaffold was flumequine and the compound indicated that activity against gram-positive bacteria could be  improved in the old quinolones. the addition of a flourine atom at the c6-position is essential for the inhibition of target enzymes. the results show the poten antibacterial activity and the penetration of the quinolone molecule into the bacterial cells and human tissue. the real breakthrough came with the combination of these two features in nflx, a 6-fluorinated quinolone having a piperazinyl group at the c7-position, nflx features significant differences from  the old quinolones in the activities and pharmacokinetics in humans, resulting in high clinical efficacy in the treatment of many kinds of infections including rtis.consequently, those great discoveries are rapidly superseded by even better  compounds and nflx proved to be just the beginning of a highly successful period  of research into the modifications of the new quinolone antibacterials. simce the chemical structure and important features of nflx had become apparent in 1978, many compounds were patented in the next three years, several of which reached the market. among the drugs, ofloxacin (oflx) and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) are recognized as superior in several respects to the oral beta-lactam antibiotics as an antibacterial agent. with a focus on oflx and cpfx, numerous research groups entered the antibacterial therapeutic field, triggering intense competition in the search to find newer, more effective quinolones. after nflx was introduced in the market, while resulting by the end of today, eleven kinds of other new quinolones launched in japan. they are enoxacin (enx), oflx, cpfx, lomefloxacin (lflx), fleroxacin (frlx), tosufloxacin (tflx), levofloxacin (lvfx), sparfloxacin (spfx), gatifloxacin (gflx), prulifloxacin (pulx) and also pazufloxacin (pzfx). the advantages of these compounds, e.g., lvfx, spfx and gflx, are that their spectrum includes gram-positive bacteria species as well as gram-negative bacteria and they improve bioavailability results when a daily dose is administered for systemic infections including rtis. however, unexpected adverse  reactions, such as the cns reaction, the drug-drug interaction, phototoxicity, hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity such as the qtc interval prolongation of ecg, have been reported in the clinical evaluations or the post-marketing surveillance of several new quinolones. moreover, the adverse reactions of arthropathy (the joint toxicity) predicated from studies in juvenile animals have never materialized in clinical use. therefore, no drugs other than nflx have yet been approved for pediatric use. fortunately, the newer quinolones are being developed and tested to reduce these adverse reactions on the basis of recent studies. on the other hand, multi-drug resistant gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphycolocci (mrcns), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have been a serious  problem in the medical community. recently, the new quinolone antibacterials are  highly successful class of antibacterial therapeutic field, however, the increased isolation of quinolone-resistant bacteria above them has become a normal outcome. these problems of multi-drug resistance have been the driving force for the development of newer quinolones. the next gereration of quinolone antibacterial agents will be potent against multi-drug resistant bacteria, such as mrsa, and provide a lower rate of emergence in resistance. further, they should have favorable safety profiles to reduce the adverse reactions. the future of quinolones as the ultimate in pharmaceuticals must be handled cautiously if they are to realize their potential in the medical community.

TI  == complications of acute otitis media in children in southern finland.
AB  == background: the incidence of intratemporal and intracranial complications of acute otitis media (aom) has decreased and the need for operative treatment is declined in developed countries during the antibiotic era. objectives: to establish the clinical picture, diagnostic procedures, outcome and current treatment of pediatric patients with intratemporal and intracranial complications of aom. methods: a retrospective chart review with a sent questionnaire. all pediatric patients treated for intratemporal and intracranial complications of aom over the past 10 years (1990-2000) at the department of otolaryngology in the helsinki university central hospital. results: during the study period 33 children (incidence 1.1/100,000 per year), aged from 3 months to 14.2 years were  treated for intratemporal [97% (32/33)] and intracranial [3% (1/33)] complications of aom. facial paresis was found in 9% (3/33) of the patients. the  only intracranial complication was an extradural abscess with meningitis. eighteen patients (55%) were on antibiotic treatment because of aom prior to the  diagnosis of complication. neither the duration or severity of the signs and symptoms of infection at the time of admittance nor a lack of antibiotic treatment before admittance were statistically significantly associated with the  need for mastoidectomy or duration of hospitalization. streptococcus pneumoniae 25% (8/33) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 22% (7/33) were the most frequently found bacteria in the culture of middle ear and mastoid effusions. mastoidectomy was performed on 55% (18/33) of the patients. after half a year of follow-up, all the patients had normal hearing and facial function. conclusions: severe complications of aom are rare today in southern finland and the need for mastoidectomy has declined significantly. with early recognition and effective treatment of complications, the prognosis is good.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == bacteriology of medically refractory acute otitis media in children: a 9-year retrospective study.
AB  == objective: to identify the causative organisms for medically refractory acute otitis media (aom) in children, and to recommend the appropriate antibiotics for  these patients. study design: retrospective chart review. methods: the medical records for 671 children (1258 ears) undergoing myringotomies between january 1993 and december 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. "medically refractory" aom  is defined as aom requiring emergency myringotomy because of toxicity persisting  despite second-phase antibiotics. of these, 18 children were enrolled in our study, with 25 of the ears affected by medically refractory aom. myringotomy was  performed for pus drainage, bacterial culture and susceptibility studies in all cases. clinical factors were analyzed to demonstrate possible relationships with  microbiological findings. results: bacteria were recovered in specimens taken from 12 ears. the positive culture rate was 48%. bacteriological studies showed mostly growing gram-positive bacteria, such as coagulase negative staphylococcus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae (in decreasing order of incidence). the sensitivity rate to pre-myringotomy antibiotics was 85.7%. with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa and two ears with intracranial complications or pneumonia, all other isolated microorganisms were susceptible to first-generation cephalosporins. no statistically significant differences were noted between culture rates and clinical factors. conclusion: the distribution of organisms in our medically refractory aom cases differed from that for simple aom, with gram-positive bacteria having significantly higher rates of incidence.  combining intravenous aminoglycoside with first-generation cephalosporin is considered an inexpensive and effective treatment covering all potential microorganisms. vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporins are only needed for major complications or other coincident infections extant during the initial presentation.

TI  == antibacterial activities of rhodamine b-conjugated gelsolin-derived peptides compared to those of the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin ll37, magainin ii, and melittin.
AB  == the growing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria necessitates the search for new antimicrobial agents and the principles by which they work. we report that cell membrane-permeant rhodamine b (rhb)-conjugated peptides based on the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding site of gelsolin can kill the gram-negative organisms escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-positive organism streptococcus pneumoniae. rhb linkage to the qrlfqvkgrr sequence in gelsolin was essential for the antibacterial function, since the unconjugated peptide had no effect on the bacteria tested. because rhb-qrlfqvkgrr (also termed pbp10), its scrambled sequence (rhb-frvklkqgqr), and pbp10 synthesized from d-isomer amino acids show similar antibacterial properties, the  physical and chemical properties of these derivatives appear to be more important than specific peptide folding for their antibacterial functions. the similar activities of pbp10 and all-d-amino-acid pbp10 also indicate that a specific interaction between rhb derivatives and bacterial proteins is unlikely to be involved in the bacterial killing function of pbp10. by using a phospholipid monolayer system, we found a positive correlation between the antibacterial function of pbp10, as well as some naturally occurring antibacterial peptides, and the intrinsic surface pressure activity at the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. surprisingly, we observed little or no dependence of the insertion of  these peptides into lipid monolayers on the phospholipid composition. these studies show that an effective antimicrobial agent can be produced from a peptide sequence with specificity to a phospholipid not found in bacteria, and comparisons with other antimicrobial agents suggest that the surface activities of these peptides are more important than specific binding to bacterial proteins  or lipids for their antimicrobial functions.

AB  == objective: we analyzed laboratory results from corneal ulcers seen from 1976 to 1999 at the francis i. proctor foundation, a referral center in san francisco, to determine the relative frequencies of pathogens and to analyze for trends in frequencies of the most common pathogens. the results were compared with a previous study of corneal ulcers seen from 1948 to 1976 at the same institution.  methods: ulcers presenting to the proctor foundation were gram stained and cultured using standard techniques. herpetic corneal ulcers were excluded from the study. results: organisms were isolated from 427 ulcers, 38% of all cases. two hundred seventy-eight (59%) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 145 (31%) gram-negative bacteria, 16 (3%) acanthamoeba spp., and 36 (8%) fungi. staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, composing 20% of all isolates, followed by viridans group streptococci (12%), streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), moraxella spp. (5%), and serratia marcescens  (4%). over the 24-year study period the proportion of positive cultures decreased and the incidence of s. marcescens increased significantly. comparing the period  of 1948-1976 to 1976-1999, the frequency of s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa decreased, and that of s. marcescens increased significantly. conclusion: the common pathogens associated with corneal ulcers have changed over the past 50 years in northern california, with s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa being isolated relatively less often and s. marcescens being isolated with increasing frequency. the decrease in isolation of organisms over the 1976-1999 period may have resulted from increasing empiric antibiotic treatment by referring ophthalmologists.

AB  == background: the clinical features and etiology of bronchiectasis have rarely been described in non-caucasian populations, of whom the prevalence of cystic fibrosis is low. in this report, we studied the clinical features of bronchiectasis in taiwanese children. methods: using a retrospective chart review, 29 cases of bronchiectasis were diagnosed from 1991 through 2001. for each case, the diagnosis was confirmed using high-resolution computed tomography. medical records were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentation, spirometric data, and microbial isolation. radiographic findings were reviewed, and possible  causes of bronchiectasis were also identified. results: there were 17 girls and 12 boys enrolled. persistent cough, daily sputum production, and hemoptysis were  common presenting symptoms. crackles and wheezing were the most frequent findings during the physical examination. previous lower airway infection, asthma, and primary immunodeficiency were the most common, but 31.0% of the cases had unknown causes. dependent lobes were involved more frequently. simultaneous sinusitis was noted in 70.6% of the cases. spirometry showed mild airway obstruction in most of the cases. most specimens (52.2%) from lower airway secretions yielded bacterial  pathogens, most commonly pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. conclusion: continuing post-infectious inflammatory changes remains the most important cause of bronchiectasis in a non-caucasian pediatric population in northern taiwan in the 1990s. more than two thirds of these patients had underlying predisposing factors including asthma, immunodeficiency, and swallowing dysfunction. chronic productive purulent respiratory secretions and persistent crackles should raise the possibility of bronchiectasis in children even in taiwan where the incidence of cystic fibrosis  is low.

TI  == management of postirradiation infection: lessons learned from animal models.
AB  == ionizing radiation depresses host defenses and enhances susceptibility to local and systemic infection due to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. exposure of mice to a lethal dose of ionizing 60co-gamma radiation induces a dose-related reduction in the number of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10(10-12) to  10(4-6) per gram of stool within 4 days. the number of anaerobic bacteria stays low, but the number of enterobacteriaceae per gram of stool increases significantly up to 10(9) by the 12th day after irradiation. this increase is associated with bacterial translocation of these organisms and fatal bacteremia.  the use of quinolones in the irradiated animals was effective in controlling systemic endogenous gram-negative infection after irradiation. supplementation with penicillin prevented treatment failures due to streptococcus spp. and increased survival. quinolones given for 21 days also were effective in management of systemic exogenous infections due to orally ingested klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. effectiveness of quinolones may be attributed to inhibition of exogenous organism growth within the gut lumen while  preserving the anaerobic gut flora as well as their systemic antibacterial activity. based on these findings, antimicrobial agents recommended for therapy of infection after exposure to irradiation are: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gentamicin +/- amoxicillin, or vancomycin.

TI  == identification and characterization of the first class of potent bacterial acetyl-coa carboxylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity.
AB  == the multisubunit acetyl-coa carboxylase, which catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis, is broadly conserved among bacteria. its rate-limiting role in formation of fatty acids makes this enzyme an attractive target for the design of novel broad-spectrum antibacterials. however, no potent  inhibitors have been discovered so far. this report describes the identification  and characterization of highly potent bacterial acetyl-coa carboxylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity for the first time. we demonstrate that pseudopeptide pyrrolidine dione antibiotics such as moiramide b inhibit the escherichia coli enzyme at nanomolar concentrations. moiramide b targets the carboxyltransferase reaction of this enzyme with a competitive inhibition pattern versus malonyl-coa  (k(i) value = 5 nm). inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of the pyrrolidine diones is also demonstrated using recombinantly expressed carboxyltransferases from other bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). we isolated pyrrolidine dione-resistant strains of e. coli, s. aureus, and bacillus subtilis, which contain mutations within the carboxyltransferase subunits acca or accd. we demonstrate that such mutations confer resistance to pyrrolidine diones. inhibition values (ic(50)) of >100 microm regarding an eukaryotic acetyl-coa carboxylase from rat liver indicate high selectivity of pyrrolidine diones for the bacterial multisubunit enzyme. the natural product moiramide b and synthetic analogues show broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the knowledge of the target and the availability of facile assays using carboxyltransferases from different pathogens will enable evaluation of the antibacterial potential of the pyrrolidine diones as a promising antibacterial compound class acting via a novel mode of action.

AB  == three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). the procedure was scheduled at four  different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. five patients were studied at each point of time. drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the nccls guidelines. mean (+/-s.d.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/l and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/l, respectively. levels above 1.0 mg/l were detected as long as 24 h. the peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against pseudomonas aeruginosa. bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate  for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == transthoracic lung aspiration in etiology of pneumonia.
AB  == transthoracic lung aspiration was performed in 30 episodes of pneumonia in 27 children with malignancy on chemotherapy to assess etiology of pulmonary infections. total of 22 organisms were isolated in 16/30 (53.3%) episodes. no acid fast bacilli or pneumocystis carinii were seen. organisms grown by blood culture correlated with that of lung puncture in 5 episodes, while throat culture and nasopharyngeal organisms correlated with that of lung puncture on one occasion each. organisms isolated in 8/18 episodes (44.4%) of antemorten transthoracic aspiration included: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis and diphtheroids. in 3/18 episodes, lung puncture results altered treatment and thus resulted in survival of the patients. only one minor complication occurred in this study--pneumothorax that resolved spontaneously. thus, transthoracic lung puncture is an useful and safe procedure  in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia who do not respond to initial broad  spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in taiwan. while some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be  unique for specific regions. methods: to determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from chang gung memorial hospital at chia-yi from january 2002 through december 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. results: the most common gram-positive isolate was staphylococcus aureus. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by acinetobacter baumannii. oxacillin resistance rate of s. aureus was  58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. the penicillin non-susceptibility rate of streptococcus pneumoniae was  52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. resistance to various antimicrobial agents for p. aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. infections caused by multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant a. baumannii was rarely encountered. antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid salmonella, s. choleraesuis and serogroup b isolates in particular. conclusion: the high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem in many parts of the world. antibiotic resistance has been associated with the use of some antibiotics but not with others. due to the overuse of antibiotics with a high resistance potential, there has been an increase of resistance with certain bacteria, e.g.,  staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae. this  article discusses the antibiotics associated with a high resistance potential and those that are safe to use with a low resistance potential. strategies for minimizing antibiotic resistance are discussed.

TI  == new developments in antibacterial choice for lower respiratory tract infections in elderly patients.
AB  == elderly patients are at increased risk of developing lower respiratory tract infections compared with younger patients. in this population, pneumonia is a serious illness with high rates of hospitalisation and mortality, especially in patients requiring admission to intensive care units (icus). a wide range of pathogens may be involved depending on different settings of acquisition and patient's health status. streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial isolate in community-acquired pneumonia, followed by haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and atypical pathogens such as chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. however, elderly patients with  comorbid illness, who have been recently hospitalised or are residing in a nursing home, may develop severe pneumonia caused by multidrug resistant staphylococci or pneumococci, and enteric gram-negative bacilli, including pseudomonas aeruginosa. moreover, anaerobes may be involved in aspiration pneumonia. timely and appropriate empiric treatment is required in order to enhance the likelihood of a good clinical outcome, prevent the spread of antibacterial resistance and reduce the economic impact of pneumonia. international guidelines recommend that elderly outpatients and inpatients (not in icu) should be treated for the most common bacterial pathogens and the possibility of atypical pathogens. the algorithm for therapy is to use either a selected beta-lactam combined with a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin),  or to use monotherapy with a new anti-pneumococcal quinolone, such as levofloxacin, gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. oral (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil) and intravenous (sulbactam/ampicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) beta-lactams are agents of choice in outpatients and inpatients, respectively. for patients with severe pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, the specific algorithm is to use either a macrolide or a quinolone in combination with other agents; the nature and the number of which depends on the presence of risk factors for specific pathogens. despite these recommendations, clinical resolution of pneumonia in the elderly is often delayed with respect to younger patients, suggesting that optimisation of antibacterial therapy is needed. recently, some new classes of antibacterials, such as ketolides, oxazolidinones and streptogramins, have been developed for the treatment of multidrug resistant gram-positive infections. however, the efficacy  and safety of these agents in the elderly is yet to be clarified. treatment guidelines should be modified on the basis of local bacteriology and resistance patterns, while dosage and/or administration route of each antibacterial should be optimised on the basis of new insights on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters and drug interactions. these strategies should be able to reduce the occurrence of risk factors for a poor clinical outcome, hospitalisation and death.

TI  == comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme m and  p.
AB  == lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme m and p, but only the m enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. disruption of the lysozyme m locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a gram-negative bacterium. unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme m-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. muramidase activity in lysozyme m-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme p mrna and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. the muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme p was less than that of recombinant m lysozyme. recombinant p lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme m to achieve the same level of killing. the lower antimicrobial activity of p lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by p lysozyme in lysozyme m-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. recombinant lysozyme m and p were equally effective in killing selected gram-positive organisms. this outcome suggests that disruption of both m and p loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the role of intrapleural streptokinase in the management of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children. design: prospective comparative study. setting: cheng kung university hospital, a tertiary medical center in tainan, taiwan. patients and methods: we enrolled as our prospective study group 20 consecutive children with complicated parapneumonic effusions who  received intrapleural streptokinase treatment between august 2000 and july 2002.  we also retrospectively analyzed a comparison group of 22 consecutive children with complicated parapneumonic effusions who received chest tube drainage without streptokinase treatment from january 1992 to july 2000. we then compared the clinical manifestations and outcome of these two patient groups. the patient population (21 boys and 21 girls) ranged in age from 9 to 130 months (mean age, 41.5 +/- 26.3 months [mean +/- sd]). the characters of pleural effusion showed no difference between the two groups. nineteen patients had positive findings for streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 patients had positive findings for staphylococcus aureus, 2 patients had positive findings for pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 19 patients had undetermined pathogens. all patients were treated with appropriate antibiotics. results: more pleural fluid was drained from the streptokinase group than from the comparison group during streptokinase treatment (816 +/- 481 ml vs  279 +/- 238 ml, p < 0.01). the duration of fever after chest tube insertion was also significantly lower in the study group (5.3 +/- 3.1 days vs 7.9 +/- 4.6 days, p < 0.05). only two patients in the streptokinase group required surgical intervention compared with nine patients in the comparison group (p < 0.05). no major side effects were noticed after streptokinase instillation. conclusion: intrapleural fibrinolytic treatment with streptokinase is safe and effective, and it can obviate the need for surgery in most cases. the combination treatment should be attempted early on, when complicated parapneumonic effusion is first diagnosed.

AB  == ecological surveys of high-antibiotic use areas in the hospital should be used to evaluate patterns and trends in order to optimise antibiotic consumption and minimise resistance. we conducted a retrospective cohort study with the aim to examine trends in antimicrobial consumption and bacterial susceptibility at the geneva university hospital and its adult icus between 1996 and 2000. the average  annual consumption of antimicrobials was 400 d-defined doses (ddd)/1000 patient-d in the entire hospital, 462 in the surgical icu and 683 in the medical icu. in the medical icu, we observed a steady decrease of intravenous antimicrobial use,  whereas a 25% increase in the total antimicrobial consumption was noted in 1999 and 2000 for the entire hospital. the proportion of different bacterial species,  resistance rates and antibiotic consumption rates differed between the entire hospital and the icus, with moderate variation between y. possible relationships  between antibiotic consumption and resistance rates, expressed as ddd and as number of resistant isolates per 1000 patient-d respectively, were calculated for of the most frequently isolated bacteria (total 71 correlations). statistically significant positive correlations between antibiotic consumption and resistance were found in escherichia coli for piperacillin, in pseudomonas aeruginosa for piperacillin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, in klebsiella spp. for cephalosporin, in coagulase-negative staphylococci for gentamicin and in streptococcus pneumoniae for penicillin.

TI  == cefepime: a review of its use in the management of hospitalized patients with pneumonia.
AB  == cefepime (maxipime), maxcef, cepimax, cepimex, axepim, a parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, is active against many organisms causative in pneumonia. cefepime has in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms including staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. cefepime also has good activity against gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, similar to that of ceftazidime. importantly, cefepime is stable against many of the common plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases and is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamases. as a result, it retains activity against enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, such as derepressed mutants of enterobacter spp. cefepime may be hydrolyzed by the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases produced by some members of the enterobacteriaceae, but to a lesser extent than the third-generation cephalosporins. monotherapy with cefepime 1 or 2g, usually administered intravenously twice daily, was as effective for clinical and bacteriological response as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime monotherapy (1 or 2g two or three times daily) in a number of randomized, clinical trials in hospitalized adult, or less commonly, pediatric, patients with generally moderate to severe community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia. more limited data indicated that monotherapy with cefepime 2g three times daily was also as effective in treating patients with nosocomial pneumonia as imipenem/cilostatin 0.5g four times daily, and when combined with amikacin, cefepime was as effective as ceftazidime plus amikacin. patients with pneumonia who failed to respond to previous antibacterial therapy with penicillins or other cephalosporins responded to treatment with cefepime. cefepime is generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to those of other parenteral cephalosporins. in clinical trials, the majority of adverse events experienced by cefepime recipients were mild to moderate and reversible. the most common adverse events with a causal relationship to cefepime reported in clinical trials included rash  and diarrhea. other, less common, adverse events included pruritus, urticaria, nausea, vomiting oral candidiasis, colitis, headache, fever, erythema and vaginitis. conclusion: cefepime is an established and generally well tolerated parenteral drug with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity which, when administered twice daily, provides coverage of most of the pathogens that may be  causative in pneumonia. in randomized clinical trials in hospitalized patients with generally moderate to severe community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia, cefepime monotherapy exhibited good clinical and bacteriological efficacy. cefepime may become a preferred antibacterial agent for infections caused by enterobacter spp. with prudent use in order to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms, cefepime will continue to be a suitable option for the empiric treatment of pneumonia.

AB  == severe community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is a life-threatening condition that requires intensive care unit (icu) admission. clinical presentation is characterized by the presence of respiratory failure, severe sepsis, or septic shock. severe cap accounts for approximately 5-35% of hospital-treated cases of pneumonia with the majority of patients having underlying comorbidities. the most common pathogens associated with this disease are streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella spp., haemophilus influenzae, and gram-negative enteric rods. microbial investigation is probably helpful in the individual case but is likely  to be more useful for defining local antimicrobial policies. the early and rapid  initiation of empiric antimicrobial treatment is critical for a favorable outcome. it should include intravenous beta-lactam along with either a macrolide  or a fluoroquinolone. modifications of this basic regimen should be considered in the presence of distinct comorbid conditions and risk factors for specific pathogens. other promising nonantimicrobial new therapies are currently being investigated. the assessment of severity of cap helps physicians to identify patients who could be managed safely in an ambulatory setting. it may also play a crucial role in decisions about length of hospital stay and time of switching to  oral antimicrobial therapy in different groups at risk. the most important adverse prognostic factors include advancing age, male sex, poor health of patient, acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis, septic shock, progressive radiographic course, bacteremia, signs of disease progression within the first 48-72 hours, and the presence of several different pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative enteric bacilli, or pseudomonas  aeruginosa. however, some important topics of severity assessment remain controversial, including the definition of severe cap. prediction rules for complications or death from cap, although far from perfect, should identify the majority of patients with severe cap and be used to support decision-making by the physician. they may also contribute to the evaluation of processes and outcomes of care for patients with cap.

TI  == pseudomonal infections in patients with copd: epidemiology and management.
AB  == copd is a common disease with increasing prevalence. the chronic course of the disease is characterized by acute exacerbations that cause significant worsening  of symptoms. bacterial infections play a dominant role in approximately half of the episodes of acute exacerbations of copd. the importance of pseudomonal infection in patients with acute exacerbations of copd stems from its relatively  high prevalence in specific subgroups of these patients, and particularly its unique therapeutic ramifications. the colonization rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with copd in a stable condition is low.a review of a large number of  clinical series of unselected outpatients with acute exacerbations of copd revealed that p. aeruginosa was isolated from the patients' sputum at an average  rate of 4%. this rate increased significantly in copd patients with advanced airflow obstruction, in whom the rate of sputum isolates of p. aeruginosa reached 8-13% of all episodes of acute exacerbations of copd. however, the great majority of bacteria isolated in these patients were not p. aeruginosa, but the three classic bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the subgroup of patients, with acute exacerbations of copd, with the highest rate of p. aeruginosa infection, which approaches 18% of the episodes, is mechanically ventilated patients. however, even in this subgroup the great majority of bacteria isolated are the above-mentioned three classic pathogens. in light of these epidemiologic data and other important considerations, and in order to achieve optimal antibacterial coverage for the common infectious etiologies, empiric antibacterial therapy should be instituted as follows. patients with acute exacerbations of copd with advanced airflow obstruction (fev(1) <50% of predicted under stable conditions) should receive once daily oral therapy with one of the newer fluoroquinolones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin,  gatifloxacin, or gemifloxacin for 5-10 days. patients with severe acute exacerbations of copd who are receiving mechanical ventilation should receive amikacin in addition to one of the intravenous preparations of the newer fluoroquinolones or monotherapy with cefepime, a carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam. in both subgroups it is recommended that sputum cultures be performed before initiation of therapy so that the results can guide further therapy.

TI  == treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  == objective: to investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. methods: susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the e-test method. pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. three identical studies were conducted using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. after 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. the main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. results: in vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the mic of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin  and ofloxacin for p. aeruginosa. pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a  denuded epithelium. all serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the s. aureus model and a similar decrease in the s pneumoniae and p aeruginosa models. conclusions: topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. clinical relevance trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.

TI  == mucosal immunization against respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  == bacterial respiratory diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. the young and the elderly are particularly susceptible to the pathogens that cause these diseases. therapeutic approaches remain dependent  upon antibiotics contributing to the persistent increases in antibiotic resistance. the main causes of respiratory disease discussed in this review are mycobacterium tuberculosis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, bordatella pertussis, streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all these organisms initiate disease at the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract and thus the efficacy of the host's  response to infection needs to be optimal at this site. vaccines available for diseases caused by many of these pathogens have limitations in accessibility or efficacy, highlighting the need for improvements in approaches and products. the  most significant challenges in both therapy and prevention of disease induced by  bacteria in the respiratory tract remain the development of non-injectable vaccines and delivery systems/immunization regimens that improve mucosal immunity.

TI  == pneumonia due to antibiotic resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the haart era.
AB  == antibiotic resistance profiles are useful in directing therapeutic strategies during bacterial infections. patterns of antimicrobial resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa associated pneumonia were investigated in an hiv-1 infected cohort during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. the median cd4 count at presentation was significantly lower for cases of p aeruginosa than for s pneumoniae. however, the number of antibiotic resistant cases of p aeruginosa decreased throughout the study period, while the incidence of s pneumoniae remained unchanged. in contrast to pneumococcal pneumonia, we show that antiretrovirals have protected from pneumonia due to antibiotic resistant p aeruginosa. these findings have implications for the treatment of individuals presenting with serious infections  in which antibiotic therapy needs to be instituted before identification and sensitivities are known.

TI  == a cross-genomic approach for systematic mapping of phenotypic traits to genes.
AB  == we present a computational method for de novo identification of gene function using only cross-organismal distribution of phenotypic traits. our approach assumes that proteins necessary for a set of phenotypic traits are preferentially conserved among organisms that share those traits. this method combines organism-to-phenotype associations,along with phylogenetic profiles,to identify proteins that have high propensities for the query phenotype; it does not require the use of any functional annotations for any proteins. we first present the statistical foundations of this approach and then apply it to a range of phenotypes to assess how its performance depends on the frequency and specificity of the phenotype. our analysis shows that statistically significant associations  are possible as long as the phenotype is neither extremely rare nor extremely common; results on the flagella,pili, thermophily,and respiratory tract tropism phenotypes suggest that reliable associations can be inferred when the phenotype  does not arise from many alternate mechanisms.

TI  == the role of the methylene blue and toluidine blue monomers and dimers in the photoinactivation of bacteria.
AB  == the interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (mb) and toluidine blue (tb), and bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. this demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of mb and tb. the effective dimerization constants of mb and tb were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) cfu/ml. the analysis of the effective dimerization constants for mb and tb in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for tb than for mb. gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. there was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. these results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.

TI  == topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (aomt) in pediatric patients. methods: this multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an aomt episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. the  mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. clinical signs and symptoms of aomt were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). a patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. principal pretherapy pathogens included streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), s epidermidis (10.2%), and moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). results: ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. no change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. conclusion: topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of aomt.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2001)].
AB  == from october 2001 to september 2002, we collected the specimen from 370 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 458 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 456 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 69, streptococcus pneumoniae 72, haemophilus influenzae 85, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 44, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, klebsiella pneumoniae 32, moraxella subgenus branhamella  catarrhalis 32, and others. of 69 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 43.5%. vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa as observed in 2000. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) was 59.7% and both rates of pisp and prsp were the highest after 1992. carbapenems had strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially,  panipenem and imipenem inhibited the growth of all 72 strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. generally, all drugs had strong activities against h. influenzae with mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity against h. influenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 80 of the 85 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. against p. aeruginosa mucoid strain, meropenem had a strong activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml while, against non-mucoid strain, tobramycin had a strong activity with mic90 of  2 micrograms/ml. k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline, and the mic90s were 4 micrograms/ml or less. particularly, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, and imipenem had the strongest activity (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml), and cefozopran had a strong activity, inhibiting the growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, all drugs generally had strong  activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic90s of all drugs were 4 micrograms/ml  or less. the drug that had the strongest activity was minocycline and levofloxacin inhibiting all 32 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (40.5%). as for the incidence by the diseases,  bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 39.2% and 37.3% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (19.3%) and s. pneumoniae (19.9%). in contrast, h. influenzae (22.0%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were s. pneumoniae (20.8%) and h.  influenzae (21.5%). s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae decreased after the initiation of drug administration while s. aureus increased. the isolation frequency of p. aeruginosa was higher after than before the initiation of drug administration. the bacteria were frequently isolated from the patients who had already treated with cephems were s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. from the patients  who had already treated with macrolides, s. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated while s. aureus was the most frequently isolated from the patients pre-treated with quinolones.

TI  == hearing loss with stapedotomy in otitis media.
AB  == objective: stapes fixation is often found in patients with either active or inactive otitis media (om). stapedotomy is generally not performed in ears with om because of the potential risk of sensorineural hearing loss (snhl). recent studies have demonstrated that the inner ear may be fenestrated in the presence of om without significantly increased risk of snhl. the goal of this study was to determine if stapedotomy in the presence of om significantly increases the incidence of postoperative snhl. methods: streptococcus pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa was injected bilaterally into the middle ears of guinea pigs (n = 18 and 16, respectively). a control group (n = 14) was injected with saline solution. two days postinjection, a unilateral stapedotomy was performed. auditory thresholds were evaluated by electrocochleography before and after stapedotomy. results: bacterial om was induced in all ears injected with pneumococci and pseudomonas. auditory thresholds increased in all ears treated with stapedotomy. stapedotomy performed in the presence of pseudomonas om resulted in significantly greater snhl than in control or pneumococcal ears (p =  0.0055). hearing thresholds were not significantly different between pneumococcal om and control ears treated with stapedotomy. conclusion: stapedotomy in the presence of pseudomonas om, but not pneumococcal om, significantly increases the  risk of snhl in the guinea pig model. significance: stapedotomy should be avoided in patients with active om, particularly in the presence of pseudomonas.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the emergence of multi-drug resistant microorganisms presents a critical problem for patients undergoing surgery. acidic ph, which is produced by oxidized regenerated cellulose (orc), is a broad-spectrum physiological detriment to survival of microorganisms known to cause surgical infections. the purpose of  this study was to examine the antimicrobial effect of orc against antibiotic-resistant organisms. methods: orc products were challenged with atcc reference strains and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), and non-resistant atcc strains of s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. samples of three orc products (surgicel absorbable hemostat, surgicel fibrillar absorbable hemostat, and surgicel nu-knit absorbable hemostat and identified, respectively, as orc-r, orc-f, and orc-n for this study) were inoculated with challenge organisms in nutrient broth to produce a weight to volume ratio of 15 mg orc/ml. plate counts were performed at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h. results: antimicrobial activity was seen with all three orc products against the  challenge organisms. data indicate that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms remain susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of orc. in testing with nine of  10 bacteria, including four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates (vre, mrsa, and prsp) three-log or greater reductions were seen at 24-h exposure. one atcc strain of vre demonstrated some level of resistance to the acidic ph effect. orc-n showed a three-log reduction with this organism, whereas the reductions with orc-r and orc-f were less than one log. conclusion: since low ph affects a relatively broad-spectrum of bacteria and does not act in a mechanism-specific manner, as do antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are unlikely  to resist the orc ph effect. results of this in vitro assessment support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial activity of orc is effective against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

TI  == bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in taiwan.
AB  == a retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in taiwan from january 1999 to december 1999 was performed. there were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. three of the 5 isolates of s. aureus were resistant to methicillin. twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent  antibiotic use, p. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (10%), k. pneumoniae (10%), escherichia coli (10%), and e. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were  the independent risk factors of bacteremia. there were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with p. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, s. aureus, and streptococcus mitis, respectively. broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.

TI  == susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and  to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number  of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations)  per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli  to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all  traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in southern israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  == background: acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (aom) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. objectives: to report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the soroka university medical center, beer-sheva, israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with streptococcus pneumoniae. patients and methods: we reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) aom. results: one hundred sixteen episodes  of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). the average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases  during the study period. acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of aom in 10 (10%) patients. fever >38 degrees c and >15,000 wbc/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; p < 0.002). computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. the most commonly isolated organisms were s. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). all s.  pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. conclusions: (1) the incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in southern israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of aom with significantly higher rates of s. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable h. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in southern israel.

TI  == septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis: review of 100 cases.
AB  == we report a novel case of septic arthritis of the symphysis pubis due to streptococcus pneumoniae and review 99 previously reported cases of infection of  this joint. typical features of pubic symphysis infection included fever (74%), pubic pain (68%), painful or waddling gait (59%), pain with hip motion (45%), and groin pain (41%). risk factors included female incontinence surgery (24%); sports, especially soccer (19%); pelvic malignancy (17%); and intravenous drug use (15%). septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis is often misdiagnosed as osteitis pubis, a sterile inflammatory condition. causative organisms differed according to risk factors. staphylococcus aureus was the major cause among athletes, pseudomonas aeruginosa among intravenous drug users, and infections among patients with pelvic malignancies were usually polymicrobial, involving fecal flora. patients with recent urinary incontinence surgery usually had monomicrobial infection, with no predominant pathogen. since osteomyelitis is present in 97% of patients, we recommend antibiotic courses of 6 weeks' duration. surgical debridement is required in 55% of patients.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of garenoxacin (bms-284756). sentry program, spain (1999-2000)].
AB  == introduction: to evaluate the in vitro activity of the new des-fluoro quinolone,  garenoxacin (bms-284756), compared to activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,  and gatifloxacin in clinical isolates recovered over 1999 and 2000 within the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. methods: quinolone-mics were performed using the standard nccls microdilution technique in 2599 isolates recovered from  hospital ramon y cajal (madrid), virgen macarena (sevilla), and bellvitge (barcelona). results: the modal mic range value exhibited by garenoxacin ( < or = 0.03-0.12 mg/l) for enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of the other quinolones tested. a total of 70% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to garenoxacin and 85% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. garenoxacin exhibited the highest activity in staphylococcus aureus, including both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates, with mic90 values of < or = 0.03 and 2 mg/l, respectively. all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were susceptible  to garenoxacin, regardless of their penicillin susceptibility status; in terms of mic90, garenoxacin was 16 times more active than ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and 4-8 times more active than gatifloxacin. all 6 ciprofloxacin-resistant s. pneumoniae strains showed garenoxacin mic values ranging from < or = 0.03 to 0.5  mg/l. in haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, garenoxacin displayed  excellent in vitro activity (mic < or = 0.06 mg/l), similar to that of the other  quinolones tested. conclusions: garenoxacin activity was similar to the activity  of other quinolones in enterobacteriaceae, but was lower in p. aeruginosa. garenoxacin activity was clearly higher than that of other quinolones in gram-positive isolates, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus and s. pneumoniae with reduced penicillin susceptibility.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin compared to other quinolones against recent clinical bacterial isolates from hospitalized and community-based  cancer patients.
AB  == the in vitro spectrum of moxifloxacin (a c-8-methoxyquinolone) was compared to that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against 924 recent clinical isolates from  cancer patients. moxifloxacin was more active than the comparator agents against  gram-positive pathogens, with potent activity against aerococcus spp., listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus spp., rhodococcus equi, and stomatococcus mucilaginous, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., all beta hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. it also had good to moderate activity against bacillus spp., corynebacterium spp., enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae, moxifloxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at < or =2.0 microg/ml. moxifloxacin was the least active of the three agents tested against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, but had significant activity against other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli including acinetobacter spp., flavobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp. other than p. aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the  overall broad spectrum of moxifloxacin, and its availability for both oral and parenteral administration, warrants its evaluation for the prevention and treatment of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial potency and spectrum of abt-492, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == abt-492 demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against most quinolone-susceptible pathogens. the rank order of potency was abt-492 > trovafloxacin > levofloxacin > ciprofloxacin against quinolone-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. abt-492 had activity comparable to  those of trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against seven species of  quinolone-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, although it was less active than the comparators against citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. the activity of abt-492 was greater than those of the comparators against fastidious gram-negative species, including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. and against pseudomonas aeruginosa and helicobacter pylori. abt-492 was as active as trovafloxacin against chlamydia trachomatis, indicating good intracellular penetration and antibacterial activity. in particular, abt-492 was more active than trovafloxacin and levofloxacin against multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and h. influenzae, including beta-lactam-resistant strains. it retained greater in vitro activity than the comparators against s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae strains resistant to other quinolones due to amino acid alterations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target topoisomerases. abt-492 was a potent inhibitor of bacterial topoisomerases, and unlike the comparators, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv from either staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli were almost equally sensitive to abt-492. the profile of abt-492 suggested that it may be a useful agent for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, as well as infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and skin and skin structure and nosocomial lung infections.

TI  == levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in esrd and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  == background: no published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. methods: eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression  analysis using adapt ii (biomedical simulations resource, university of southern  california, los angeles, ca). ratios of maximum serum concentration (c(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) data from published studies. results: all subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and c(max) were 37.0 ml/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 ml/min), 103.3 l (range, 39.8 to 139.3 l), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/ml (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/ml), respectively. median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 ml/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 ml/min)  and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. median c(max)-mic90 ratios were  10 or greater for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, enterobacter cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: the administration of levofloxacin to patients with esrd as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every  48 hours, will provide adequate c(max)-mic ratios after the first and subsequent  doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin mics of 1 microg/ml or less.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by e test.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by e test. we found that the mic(50) and mic(90) values against all members of the enterobacteriaceae family except serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (mic range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. the susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae, although serratia and acinetobacter exhibited more or  less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (mic(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. the ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. we propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these  three fluoroquinolones in treating enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). these data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of acinetobacter and p. aeruginosa), as  well as s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae.

AB  == the in vivo antibacterial activity of s-3578, a new parental cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem-cilastatin, and vancomycin. the efficacy of s-3578 against systemic infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) sr3637 (50% effective dose [ed(50)], 7.21 mg/kg of body weight) was almost the same as that of vancomycin. in contrast, cefepime and imipenem-cilastatin were less active against this pathogen (ed(50)s, >100 and >100 mg/kg, respectively). s-3578 was the most effective compound against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae sr20946  (ed(50), 1.98 mg/kg). s-3578 (10 mg/kg) induced a significant reduction in the numbers of viable mrsa sr17764 and pseudomonas aeruginosa sr10396 organisms in polymicrobial pulmonary infections. the therapeutic efficacy of s-3578 was more potent than that of the combination of vancomycin and ceftazidime. high levels of s-3578 were detected in plasma in vivo, and its efficacy against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by mrsa and p. aeruginosa reflected its potent  in vitro activity. we conclude that s-3578 is a promising new cephalosporin for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including mrsa and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the role of mutators in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that maintain genome stability. however, strains exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of pathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria meningitidis, helicobacter pylori and streptococcus pneumoniae. the majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (mmr) system, with mutations in muts predominating. mmr-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator hosts. mmr is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. removal of this barrier, as in the case of mmr defective mutators, also enhances the frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of acquired drug resistance in bacteria. permanent global mutator status is associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations more frequently than non-mutators. fitness limitations of mutators may be overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. mutators are a risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance determinants.

TI  == bacterial infections in patients requiring admission for an acute exacerbation of copd; a 1-year prospective study.
AB  == study objective: to investigate the frequency of respiratory bacterial infections in hospitalized patients, admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), to identify the responsible pathogens by sputum culture and to assess patient characteristics in relation to sputum culture results. methods: we prospectively evaluated clinical data and sputum culture results of 171 patients, admitted to the pulmonology department of the university hospital maastricht with an acute exacerbation of copd from 1st january 1999 until 31st december 1999. results: eighty-five patients (50%) had positive sputum cultures, indicating the presence of bacterial infection. pathogens most frequently isolated were: haemophilus influenzae (45%), streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%). patients with more severely compromised lung function had a higher incidence of bacterial infections (p = 0.026). there were no significant differences in age, lung function parameters, blood gas results and length of hospital stay between patients with and without bacterial infection. there were no correlations between the type of bacteria isolated and clinical characteristics. conclusion: incidence of bacterial infection during acute exacerbations of copd is about 50%. patients  with and without bacterial infection are not different in clinical characteristics or in outcome parameters. patients with lower fev1 have a higher  incidence of bacterial infections, but there is no difference in the type of bacterial infection. in the future, the pathogenic role of bacterial infection in exacerbations of copd should be further investigated, especially the role of bacterial infection in relation to local and systemic inflammation.

TI  == a prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  == study objectives: to determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. design: prospective cohort study. setting: department  of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. patients: all patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between january 1997 and february 2001. interventions: none. results: two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. the majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). there were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. the most frequent pathogens were gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). the predominant gram-negative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the gram-positive bacteria. no multiresistant bacteria were observed. bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. conclusions: the predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with s pneumoniae, s aureus, h influenzae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and m catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.

TI  == endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis: a 17-year prospective series and review of  267 reported cases.
AB  == endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is a rare but serious condition that occurs  when bacteria cross the blood-ocular barrier and multiply within the eye. we provide an overview of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis by reviewing 267 reported cases and integrating this with our experience of an additional 19 cases. the majority of patients with endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis are initially misdiagnosed and many have an underlying disease known to predispose to infection. this condition is often previously undiagnosed. blood cultures are the most frequent means of establishing the diagnosis. the most common gram positive  organisms are staphylococcus aureus, group b streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae,and listeria monocytogenes. the most common gram negative organisms are klebsiella spp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria meningitidis. gram negative organisms are responsible for the majority of cases reported from east asian hospitals, but gram positive organisms are more common in north america and europe. the visual outcome is poor with most cases leading to blindness in the affected eye. many patients have extraocular foci of infection, with an associated mortality rate of 5%. the outcome of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis has not improved in 55 years and clinicians need to have a high level of awareness of this commonly misdiagnosed condition.

TI  == evaluation of infectious etiology and prognostic risk factors of febrile episodes in neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  == objectives: febrile neutropenic cancer patients are at risk for development of serious infections, morbidity and mortality. the aim of this study was to determine the type and frequency of infections and to evaluate some prognostic risk factors. methods: 220 episodes of neutropenic fever in 177 cancer patients have been reviewed. results: infections could be documented microbiologically in  38 (17.3%) episodes and suspected clinically in 29 (13.2%). the most common focus of infection was the lower respiratory tract (11.4%) followed by the urinary tract (6.4%). the most frequently isolated pathogen was escherichia coli (31%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). the median durations of neutropenia and fever were 4 and 3 days, respectively. mortality was seen in 25 patients (11.4%). its rate was higher in documented infections except for non-bacteremic microbiologic  infections in which no death was seen. hypotension and shock were the most significant determinants of poor prognosis. conclusions: the management of these  special patients should be given adequate attention and be considered important since the success of therapy depends on revealing of etiologic agents.

TI  == structure analysis of peptide deformylases from streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, thermotoga maritima and pseudomonas aeruginosa: snapshots  of the oxygen sensitivity of peptide deformylase.
AB  == peptide deformylase (pdf) has received considerable attention during the last few years as a potential target for a new type of antibiotics. it is an essential enzyme in eubacteria for the removal of the formyl group from the n terminus of the nascent polypeptide chain. we have solved the x-ray structures of four members of this enzyme family, two from the gram-positive pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, and two from the gram-negative bacteria thermotoga maritima and pseudomonas aeruginosa. combined with the known structures from the escherichia coli enzyme and the recently solved structure of  the eukaryotic deformylase from plasmodium falciparum, a complete picture of the  peptide deformylase structure and function relationship is emerging. this understanding could help guide a more rational design of inhibitors. a structure-based comparison between pdfs reveals some conserved differences between type i and type ii enzymes. moreover, our structures provide insights into the known instability of pdf caused by oxidation of the metal-ligating cysteine residue.

TI  == comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). time killing curves against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pneumoniae  were performed. serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in the urine series,  levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs cfu/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on e. coli (both), p. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and p. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). in the bronchial mucosa series,  s. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and k. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. in conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.

TI  == pathogenesis of posttraumatic empyema: the impact of pneumonia on pleural space infections.
AB  == background: thoracic empyema may result either from primary pneumonic sources or  intraabdominal sources of infection that seed the pleural space secondarily. in patients with thoracostomy tubes, empyema may result when blood in the pleural space becomes contaminated during tube insertion. to elucidate the cause of posttraumatic empyema, preoperative bronchoalveolar lavage (bal)/sputum cultures  obtained from patients with posttraumatic empyema were compared with cultures obtained at the time of decortication. materials and methods: a retrospective study was conducted of trauma patients who developed empyema and underwent either video-assisted thoracoscopy or thoracotomy with decortication following blunt or  penetrating trauma. at our level i trauma center, we studied all empyema cases diagnosed from november, 1998 to july, 2001. data collection included patient demographics, injuries sustained, preoperative bal/sputum cultures, and culture data obtained at the time of decortication. all bal/sputum cultures were performed no more than 5 days prior to decortication. results: thirty-seven patients (26 blunt/11 penetrating) were identified. no patients had concurrent intra-abdominal sources of infection. all patients had at least one chest tube placed prior to decortication. preoperative respiratory cultures (bal/sputum) were obtained in 34 patients. the most common organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus in six patients (18%) and hemophilus influenzae in six patients (18%). intraoperative cultures were obtained in all 37 patients, with the most common organism being s. aureus isolated in 22 patients (60%). interestingly, a correlation between preoperative bal/sputum and intraoperative cultures was found in only seven of the 34 patients (21%) who had concomitant respiratory and pleural cultures. cultures positive for s. aureus were isolated from five patients, streptococcus pneumoniae from one patient, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from one patient. conclusion: little correlation existed between preoperative bal/sputum cultures and intraoperative cultures in this series of patients with posttraumatic empyema. this suggests that the causation is most often not a parapneumonic process. furthermore, since s. aureus was the most common organism recovered from empyema, the source was more likely from inoculation of the pleural space by the injury itself or by tube thoracostomy.

AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == pathogen of occurrence and susceptibility patterns associated with pneumonia in hospitalized patients in north america: results of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance study (2000).
AB  == antimicrobial selection for patients diagnosed with pneumonia is a major therapeutic challenge and dilemma to the clinical practitioner. in the community  setting, patients usually receive empiric oral therapy based upon multiple patient risk factors and locally prevalent pathogen susceptibilities. for patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, or who acquire pneumonia while  in the hospital, therapy can be initially empiric and then become directed once culture and susceptibility results are known. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program since 1997, has monitored pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibilities in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in north america. in this study 2,712 pathogens were studied from 30 medical centers (25 in the united states and 5 in canada). over 30 species of organisms were recovered with staphylococcus aureus comprising 28.0% of all isolates and with four other species (pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.0%, streptococcus pneumoniae 9.1%,  klebsiella spp. 7.5% and haemophilus influenzae 7.3%) constituted 71.9% of isolates submitted. methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant s. aureus accounted for 43.7% of all s. aureus isolates. antimicrobials demonstrating significant (>80%)  activity against s. aureus were: chloramphenicol (81.6%), tetracycline (91.4%), rifampin (96.4%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (99.7%); and no isolate was resistant to glycopeptides or linezolid. north american isolates of p. aeruginosa were most susceptible to amikacin (93.7%) > tobramycin (90.2%) > meropenem (89.1%) > imipenem = piperacillin/tazobactam (85.6%) > piperacillin (82.1%) > cefepime (80.5%). overall, 32.1% of s. pneumoniae were penicillin non-susceptible while erythromycin susceptibility was only 74.8%. fluoroquinolones and recent generation cephalosporins retained excellent activity (gatifloxacin [99.2%] > levofloxacin = cefepime [98.8%] > ceftriaxone [97.2%]) against s. pneumoniae. klebsiella spp. were 100.0% susceptible to the carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) but extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected at a rate of 5.4%.  the beta-lactamase-positive rate in h. influenzae was 28.6% in north america (71.4% ampicillin-susceptible). the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program continues to identify important north american patterns of pathogen frequency and resistance. additionally, the provision of multi-year longitudinal data and associated reports allow for comparisons, which function as critical tools for effective patient management and antimicrobial interventions.

AB  == little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in south africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those  found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the united states. this study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in south african children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. while 92 per cent of the children had recently  received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by haemophilus influenzae (nine), staphylococcus aureus (six), moraxella catarrhalis (two), streptococcus pyogenes (two) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). two isolates were identified in each of eight children. antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35  (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. the pneumococcal serotypes found were 19f (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23f (23 per cent), 6b (nine per cent), 19a (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months)  than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (or = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (or = 7.72, p = 0.03). almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are  antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in children: pseudomonas aeruginosa as a leading pathogen.
AB  == objective: acute mastoiditis is a serious bacterial infection of the temporal bone and is the most common complication of otitis media. the goal of this study  is to assess the clinical features, pathogens, management, and outcome of acute mastoiditis in children in northern israel. methods: a systematic review of medical records of all children who were admitted with acute mastoiditis from january 1990 through december 2000. results: fifty-seven children were included.  median was age: 36 months. in 26 patients (45.6%) mastoiditis complicated the first episode of acute otitis media (aom). twenty-five children (44%) received antibiotic treatment prior to admission. frequent symptoms included mastoid area  erythema in 54 children (94.7%), proptosis of the auricle in 52 children (91.2%)  and fever in 43 children (75.4%). middle ear, and subperiostal culture yielded growth of pathogen in 30 children (75%), two cultures yielded more then one pathogen. the most frequent pathogens were: pseudomonas aeruginosa in 10 children (25%), streptococcus pneumoniae in eight children (20%), group a streptococcus in six children (15%). the highest incidence of streptococcus pneumoniae was found in children who did not suffer from aom before admission (35 vs. 5%). fifty-two (91.2%) children were cured with antibiotic treatment alone. seventeen children underwent computed tomography (ct) of the mastoid. mastoid bone destruction was demonstrated in six children and subperiostal abscess in eight. mastoidectomy was performed in five children. conclusions: the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis can be made on clinical basis alone requiring ct only when complications are suspected. half of the children admitted with acute mastoiditis had no previous history of recurrent aom. in those children s. pneumoniae was the leading pathogen while p. aeruginosa was more prevalent in children with recurrent aom. most of the children recovered with medical therapy alone, without surgical intervention.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  == as the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (carbenin), mics of panipenem (papm) against 1355 clinical isolates of 28 species from 15 medical institutions all over japan from june 2000 to march 2001 were measured using the  broth microdilution method approved by the japanese society of chemotherapy and compared with those of parenteral carbapenem antibacterials, imipenem (ipm) and meropenem (mepm), and parenteral cephem antibacterials, cefozopran, cefepime, and sulbactam/cefoperazone. the activity of papm was comparable to that of ipm against almost all species tested. compared with mepm, papm was more active against gram-positive bacteria and bacteroides spp., and less active against gram-negative bacteria. compared with the parenteral cephems, papm was more active against most of species tested and its mic ranges were narrower than those of the cephems as were those of other carbapenems. in this surveillance study, the incidence of resistance in various species were as follows: 39.3% for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 47.3% for penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp), 15.1% for penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), 0.9% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing escherichia coli, 3.4% for esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, 19.2% for beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae, 24.0% for beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae, and 1.0% for metallo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa. against these resistant strains, carbapenems including papm showed generally more potent activity than cephems. it was noted that papm showed the most potent activity against pisp and prsp, which showed high incidence of 62.4% totally, among tested drugs. metallo-beta-lactamase producing p. aeruginosa exhibited high resistance and blnar h. influenzae also exhibited low susceptibility against all tested drugs. but no remarkable change in the activity of papm against other species was observed in this study compared with that in the studies before the marketing of carbenin. furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains such as prsp, metallo-beta-lactamase producing bacteria, and blnar h. influenzae.

TI  == activities of moxifloxacin against, and emergence of resistance in, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == the pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated in a pharmacokinetic infection model. three strains of s. pneumoniae, moxifloxacin, and two strains of p. aeruginosa were used. antibacterial effect and emergence of resistance were measured for both species over a 72-h period using an initial inoculum of about 10(8) cfu/ml.  at equivalent area under the curve (auc)/mic ratios, s. pneumoniae was cleared from the model while p. aeruginosa was not. for s. pneumoniae, the area under the bacterial kill curve up to 72 h could be related to auc/mic ratio using an inhibitory maximum effect (e(max)) model (concentration required for 50% e(max) [ec(50)], 45 +/- 22; r(2), 0.97). for p. aeruginosa even at the highest auc/mic ratio (427), bacterial clearance was insufficient for the ec(50) to be calculated. emergence of resistance occurred with p. aeruginosa but not to any significant extent with s. pneumoniae. emergence of resistance in p. aeruginosa as measured by population analysis profile (pap-auc) was dependent on drug exposure and time of exposure. in weighted least-squares regression analysis auc/mic ratio was predictive of pap-auc. when emergence of resistance was measured by the time for the colony counts on media containing antibiotic to increase by 2 logs, again auc/mic was the best predictor of emergence of resistance. however, for both experiments using s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa the correlation between all the pharmacodynamic parameters was high. these data indicate that for a given fluoroquinolone the magnitude of the auc/mic ratio for  antibacterial effect is dependent on the bacterial species. emergence of resistance is dependent on (i) species, (ii) duration of drug exposure, and (iii) drug exposure. a single auc/mic ratio magnitude is not adequate to predict antibacterial effect or emergence of resistance for all bacterial species.

TI  == in vitro activity of s-3578, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of s-3578, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against clinical isolates was evaluated. the mics of the drug at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 4 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and 2 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, which were fourfold higher than and equal to those of vancomycin, respectively. the anti-mrsa activity of s-3578 was considered to be due to its high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.5 micro g/ml). in time-kill studies with 10 strains each of mrsa and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, s-3578 caused more than a 4-log(10) decrease of viable cells on the average at twice the mic after 24 h of exposure,  indicating that it had potent bactericidal activity. furthermore, in population analysis of mrsa strains with heterogeneous or homogeneous resistance to imipenem, no colonies emerged from about 10(9) cells on agar plates containing twice the mic of s-3578, suggesting the low frequency of emergence of s-3578-resistant strains from mrsa. s-3578 was also highly active against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), with a mic(90) of 1 micro g/ml, which was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. s-3578 also had antibacterial  activity against a variety of gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa, though its activity was not superior to that of cefepime. in conclusion, s-3578 exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and, particularly, had excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and prsp. thus, s-3578 was considered to be worthy of further evaluation.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (icus) and other areas of the hospital such  as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. the problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised  patient. multi-drug resistance is common among both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). when  infections occur with esbl-kp, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. when infection occurs with vre, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against vr-e. faecium. risk factors for the development of esbl-kp include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. risk factors for the development of vre include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy  of infections. for vre, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.

TI  == biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine in bacteria.
AB  == phosphatidylcholine (pc) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes and can be synthesized by either of two pathways, the methylation pathway or the  cdp-choline pathway. many prokaryotes lack pc, but it can be found in significant amounts in membranes of rather diverse bacteria and based on genomic data, we estimate that more than 10% of all bacteria possess pc. enzymatic methylation of  phosphatidylethanolamine via the methylation pathway was thought to be the only biosynthetic pathway to yield pc in bacteria. however, a choline-dependent pathway for pc biosynthesis has been discovered in sinorhizobium meliloti. in this pathway, pc synthase, condenses choline directly with cdp-diacylglyceride to form pc in one step. a number of symbiotic (rhizobium leguminosarum, mesorhizobium loti) and pathogenic (agrobacterium tumefaciens, brucella melitensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, borrelia burgdorferi and legionella pneumophila) bacteria seem to possess the pc synthase pathway and we suggest that the respective eukaryotic host functions as the provider of choline for this pathway. pathogens entering their hosts through epithelia (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae) require phosphocholine substitutions on their cell surface components that are biosynthetically also derived from choline supplied by the host. however, the incorporation of choline in these latter cases proceeds via choline phosphate and cdp-choline as intermediates. the occurrence of two intermediates in prokaryotes usually found as intermediates in the eukaryotic cdp-choline pathway for pc biosynthesis raises the question whether some bacteria might form pc via a cdp-choline pathway.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

AB  == from october 2000 to september 2001, we collected the specimen from 410 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various anti-bacterial  agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 499 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 493 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 73, haemophilus infiuenzae 99, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 64, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, klebsiella pneumoniae 25, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 21, etc. of  78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 53.8%. vancomycin and arbekacin  had the most potent activities against mrsa as observed in 1999. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) was 38.4% being consistent with that in 1999 (34.7%). prsp accounted for 11.0% of the total, being more than that in 1999 (3.0%). carbapenems had strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 73 strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs had strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 8 micrograms/ml or less. the drug that had the strongest activity  against h. infiuenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 94 of the 99 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. tobramycin had a strong activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. the mucoid  strain was little isolated (14 strains) but the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than the non-mucoid strain. k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and the mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml or less. particularly, cefpirome, cefozopran, and levofloxacin had  strong bactericidal activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml, and cefotiam, second-generation cephems, also had a favorable activity being mic80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. also, all drugs generally had strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml  or less. the drug having the strongest activity was imipenem and levofloxacin inhibiting all 21 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (44.4%). as for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 38.0% and 31.7% of all the patients, respectively. the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were s. aureus (18.3%) and s. pneumoniae (16.1%). in contrast, h. infiuenzae (20.4%) and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid: 16.7%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were s. pneumoniae (24.3%) and h. infiuenzae (26.7%). the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae tended to decrease with the increase in the number of administration days while that of isolated h. infiuenzae did not. the frequency of isolated p. aeruginosa tended to increase with the duration of administration. the isolated bacteria were comparable between the patients already treated with penicillins and cephems. in the patients treated with aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones, p. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated (33.3 to 40.0%).

TI  == microbiological testing and outcome of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == study objectives: the study documents the impact of microbiological investigations on therapeutic decisions and outcome in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (scap). design: retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. setting: icus in two teaching spanish hospitals. patients: two hundred four consecutive patients admitted to intensive care with scap. interventions: none. measurements and results: one hundred six patients required intubation, while 98 other patients did not (81 of these patients were managed with noninvasive mechanical ventilation). the microbiologic diagnosis was established in 57.3% of patients. the most common pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, and haemophilus influenzae. pseudomonas (6.6.% vs 1.0%, p < 0.05) and legionella (15.1% vs 7.1%, p < 0.05) were more frequently documented in intubated patients. overall mortality was 23.5% (44.3% in intubated patients), with s pneumoniae (n = 7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7), and l pneumophila (n = 5) being the most common lethal pathogens. bacteriological investigation led to changes in antibiotic prescription in 41.6%  of patients, including 11 patients (5%) in whom initial treatment was ineffective against the microbial isolates. the most frequent reason for changes was simplification of therapy in 65 episodes (31.8%). conclusions: we conclude that microbiological testing is fully justified in patients with scap, because identifying the causative agent and adjusting treatment both impact on patient outcome. our findings suggest that intubated patients should be empirically treated for pseudomonas and legionella while awaiting bacteriology results.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

AB  == as part of the latin american arm of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 7,207 bacterial isolates collected consecutively from bloodstream infections (bsi) during the period of january 1997 through december 2000 were analyzed. ten latin american laboratories located in six countries participated in the study during each year. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the reference nccls broth microdilution method. the most frequently isolated species were (n/%): staphylococcus aureus (1,532/21.3%), escherichia coli (1,239/17.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (1,002/13.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (664/9.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (470/6.5%). the prevalence of s. aureus as a cause of bsi increased from 20.5% in 1997 to 23.3% in 2000 (p = 0.011), but oxacillin-resistance rates remained relatively stable during this period (around 30%). enterococci (216 isolates) showed low rates of resistance to both vancomycin (2.4%) and ampicillin (7.9%) and 72.7% of 289 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates evaluated were susceptible to penicillin (mic </=0.06 microg/ml). resistance rates among gram-negative bacilli were much higher than those reported in other regions evaluated in the sentry program. the main antimicrobial resistance problems among these pathogens were the high prevalences of esbl-producing e. coli (6.7%) and k. pneumoniae (47.3%), and carbapenem-resistance among p. aeruginosa (around 12%) and acinetobacter spp. (around 10%). p. aeruginosa resistance rates to meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin showed a significant increase during the 4-year period evaluated. resistance rates varied according to the country for several pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. in summary, resistance to most antimicrobial agents for a number of species implicated in bacteremia, especially among gram-negative rods, has reached worrisome levels and continues to increase.

TI  == [isolation frequency of burkholderia cepacia from cystic fibrosis patients].
AB  == microorganisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae frequently cause colonization and infection in airways of  patients with cystic fibrosis. burkholderia cepacia has also been isolated in patients with cystic fibrosis since 1980. in this study, we aimed to determine the colonization rate of b. cepacia in 286 sputum samples obtained from 129 cystic fibrosis patients. selective media for b. cepacia were used besides the routine microbiological media in order to increase the isolation rate. the colonies were identified by biochemical tests and the antibiotic susceptibilities of the strains were determined by disc diffusion method. pathogenic bacteria (s.  aureus, p. aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae) were isolated in 52 of 129 patients (40%) and 66 of 286 sputum samples (23%). in addition 2 b. cepacia strains were isolated from two different  patients (1.55%). b. cepacia is now being considered as a pathogen isolated from  sputum samples of patients with cystic fibrosis with an increasing frequency and  causing severe clinical features. according to these results it can be concluded  that, the use of selective media for b. cepacia isolation, should be taken into consideration especially by the clinical microbiology laboratories collaborating  with the cystic fibrosis centers.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus (mssa) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci  and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), mssa (n=187), haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. the mic value at which 90% of all enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, mssa, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (mic90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == bacteria classification using cyranose 320 electronic nose.
AB  == background: an electronic nose (e-nose), the cyrano sciences' cyranose 320, comprising an array of thirty-two polymer carbon black composite sensors has been used to identify six species of bacteria responsible for eye infections when present at a range of concentrations in saline solutions. readings were taken from the headspace of the samples by manually introducing the portable e-nose system into a sterile glass containing a fixed volume of bacteria in suspension.  gathered data were a very complex mixture of different chemical compounds. method: linear principal component analysis (pca) method was able to classify four classes of bacteria out of six classes though in reality other two classes were not better evident from pca analysis and we got 74% classification accuracy  from pca. an innovative data clustering approach was investigated for these bacteria data by combining the 3-dimensional scatter plot, fuzzy c means (fcm) and self organizing map (som) network. using these three data clustering algorithms simultaneously better 'classification' of six eye bacteria classes were represented. then three supervised classifiers, namely multi layer perceptron (mlp), probabilistic neural network (pnn) and radial basis function network (rbf), were used to classify the six bacteria classes. results: a [6 x 1] som network gave 96% accuracy for bacteria classification which was best accuracy. a comparative evaluation of the classifiers was conducted for this application. the best results suggest that we are able to predict six classes of  bacteria with up to 98% accuracy with the application of the rbf network. conclusion: this type of bacteria data analysis and feature extraction is very difficult. but we can conclude that this combined use of three nonlinear methods  can solve the feature extraction problem with very complex data and enhance the performance of cyranose 320.

TI  == [surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: vira study].
AB  == introduction: resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. the aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. material and methods: a total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in october 2001 were studied. these included 294 methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 96 enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 acinetobacter baumannii. sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. results: overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and mrsa strains was 24% in both cases. the pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. most mrsa isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. all the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only 50% of a. baumannii strains were susceptible  to imipenem. conclusion: the results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as mrsa, cns, ampicillin-resistant  enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.

TI  == cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == relationship between bacterial colonisation and the frequency, character, and severity of copd exacerbations.
AB  == background: patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are prone  to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. stable copd patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. methods: twenty nine patients with copd (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (sd) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in  1 second (fev(1)) 1.06 (0.41) l, fev(1) % predicted 38.7 (15.2)%, fev(1)/fvc 43.7 (14.1)%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. results: fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: haemophilus influenzae (53.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (20%), branhamella catarrhalis (20%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). the presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). patients colonised by h influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. the median (iqr) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by h influenzae was 2.00 (2.00-2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00-2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). the occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56-1.00) in those colonised with h influenzae and 0.33 (0.00-0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). sputum interleukin (il)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). conclusion: lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of copd exacerbations.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of caenorhabditis elegans by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas  aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill c. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. we examined c. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. we demonstrate that s. pyogenes kills c. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. unlike p. aeruginosa and s. enterica serovar typhimurium, the killing by s. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. major exotoxins of s. pyogenes are not involved in  the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout  mutants. moreover, no accumulation of s. pyogenes in c. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. preliminary results show that s. pneumoniae can also kill c. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill c. elegans.

TI  == new strains of bacteria and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background: the role of bacterial pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is controversial. in older studies, the rates of isolation of bacterial pathogens from sputum were the same during acute exacerbations and during stable disease. however, these studies did not differentiate among strains within a bacterial species and therefore could not detect changes in strains over time. we hypothesized that the acquisition of a new strain of a pathogenic bacterial species is associated with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. methods: we conducted a prospective study  in which clinical information and sputum samples for culture were collected monthly and during exacerbations from 81 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. molecular typing of sputum isolates of nonencapsulated haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed. results: over a period of 56 months, the 81 patients made a total of 1975 clinic visits, 374 of which were made during exacerbations (mean, 2.1 per patient per year). on the basis of molecular typing, an exacerbation was diagnosed at 33.0 percent of the clinic visits that involved  isolation of a new strain of a bacterial pathogen, as compared with 15.4 percent  of visits at which no new strain was isolated (p<0.001; relative risk of an exacerbation, 2.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.83 to 2.53). isolation of a new strain of h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, or s. pneumoniae was associated with a significantly increased risk of an exacerbation. conclusions: the association between an exacerbation and the isolation of a new strain of a bacterial pathogen supports the causative role of bacteria in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  == background: nasal polyps are considered to result from chronic inflammation, but  the initial or persisting stimulus for the inflammation is not known. a variety of bacteria and fungi have been cultured from nasal polyps, but approximately 35% have sterile cultures. previously, mycoplasma pneumoniae-specific dna was detected in human nasal polyps using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques,  suggesting m. pneumoniae as a causative agent in the etiology of nasal polyps. methods: in this study, we tested for the presence of bacterial dna in nasal polyps resected from 40 patients, in nasal mucosa membrane from 9 patients undergoing turbinectomy for hypertrophy, and in sinus mucosa membrane from 6 patients undergoing endoscopic surgery for chronic sinusitis. tissue dna was extracted and analyzed by pcr using m. pneumoniae specific primers for dna that encode the 16s rrna gene in 41 specimens (31 polyps, 6 turbinates, and 4 sinus),  and by consensus sequence-based pcr using broad range primers for most eubacterial dna encoding the 16s rrna gene in 38 specimens (26 polyps, 7 turbinates, and 5 sinuses). results: only two samples were positive for bacterial dna encoding 16s rrna: streptococcus sp. dna was isolatedfrom one polyp specimen  and pseudomonas aeruginosa dna was isolated in one maxillary sinusitis specimen.  no evidence of m. pneumoniae-specific dna encoding 16s rrna was found in any of the tissues. conclusions: this study suggests that chronic bacterial infection is not a major component of nasal polyp etiology.

TI  == [distribution and shifting trends of the pathogens for bacterial keratitis].
AB  == objective: to study the distribution and shifting trends of corneal bacterial isolates from bacterial keratitis retrospectively. methods: the data of bacterial cultures of 2 220 corneal isolates from january, 1989 to december, 1998 were reviewed. results: during this 10-year period, 2 220 consecutive corneal cultures were obtained, and a positive-culture was recovered in 490 isolates, the positive rate being 22.1%. in the 490 positive-cultures, gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli represented 51.0% and 39.4% respectively. gram-positive bacilli was 9.2%. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated the most commonly in the corneal isolates (32.2%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococcus (18.6%).  streptococcus pneumoniae represented 12.0%. during this period, we documented a gradual increase in the number of gram-positive cocci coupled with a decrease of  the number of gram-negative bacilli. conclusion: pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus are the most common pathogens in bacterial keratitis in the north part of china. at present, the increased recovery of gram-positive cocci and decreased of gram-negative bacilli from keratitis isolates present an important challenge to the ophthalmology.

TI  == current issues on resistance, treatment guidelines, and the appropriate use of fluoroquinolones for respiratory tract infections.
AB  == background: community-acquired respiratory tract infections comprise a large percentage of diseases treated by primary care physicians, and rates of antimicrobial use for respiratory tract infections are increasing. the fluoroquinolones comprise a drug class with broad-spectrum activity against many  of the key pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including streptococcus pneumoniae, and other significant pathogens,  such as staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. while fluoroquinolones  have gained popularity, the settings for their appropriate use in treating respiratory tract infections remain unclear. objective: in this article, the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in s. pneumoniae, treatment guidelines,  and the mode of spread of resistance are reviewed. methods: the authors conducted a medline search for articles published from 1990 to the present. search terms included streptococcus pneumoniae, fluoroquinolones, and resistance. articles were selected for inclusion based on their relevance to the objective of this review. results: although 3 sets of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) currently exist in the united states, a consensus for the role of fluoroquinolones in the outpatient management of cap has not been achieved. factors mitigating for restraint in the outpatient use of fluoroquinolones include concern for the spread of resistance to "innocent-bystander" organisms, such as s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, as well as possible inappropriate "trickle-down" use for other, less severe respiratory syndromes, such as bronchitis. conclusion: although the fluoroquinolones are potent agents against respiratory pathogens and have a clearly defined role in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cap, their optimal role in the outpatient management of respiratory tract infections remains controversial.

TI  == randomized, double-blind study of prulifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in patients  with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == background: recently the role of bacteria in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) as well as antibiotic treatment with selected drugs, especially fluoroquinolones, have been better defined. objective: to assess the efficacy and safety in patients with aecb of prulifloxacin in comparison with ciprofloxacin. methods: aecb was defined according to the guidelines for the evaluation of new anti-infective drugs for the treatment of respiratory tract infections (1992). 235 patients took part in the trial; 117 (88 males and 29 females, mean age 64.8  years) received 600 mg prulifloxacin once daily and 118 (91 males and 27 females, mean age 64.5 years) 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day, for a duration of 10 days. the study design was randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy. efficacy evaluations were performed by comparing pretreatment and posttreatment assessments. the clinical response was determined by 4-point rating scores on cough, dyspnea, and expectoration (volume and appearance). the microbiological response was assessed on sputum specimen. results: clinical success was observed  in 84.7 and 85% of patients in the prulifloxacin and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. the 95% confidence interval proved the equivalence of treatments. both drugs successfully eradicated the most commonly isolated strains, including  haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both treatments were well tolerated. adverse drug reactions were always of mild or moderate intensity. conclusion: the study showed that a 10-day course of prulifloxacin is as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin in the treatment of patients with aecb.

TI  == antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  == the antibiotic and chlorhexidine (chx) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus (not mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (mbc) and/or minimal inhibitory (mic) concentrations. non-fermentative bacteria tolerated chx at high concentrations; gram-positive cocci, especially s. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. we found a good correlation between chx and  antibiotic susceptibility in both mic and mbc among gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in mbc among gram-positive bacteria. resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate  increased chx resistance among gram-negative bacteria. this finding gives clinicians the ability to predict chx susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

TI  == potency and antimicrobial spectrum update for piperacillin/tazobactam (2000): emphasis on its activity against resistant organism populations and generally untested species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and several comparison broad-spectrum compounds was assessed against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria from geographically diverse medical centers  in europe, north and latin america participating in various surveillance programs in 2000. several organisms were characterized for phenotypic expression of various resistant determinants such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or amp c cephalosporinase hyperproduction, and vancomycin resistance in enterococci  (vre). piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity (mic50) against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp. (0.12-0.5 microg/ml), bacillus spp. (0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (>4 microg/ml), and corynebacterium spp. (2 microg/ml; not including c. jeikeium) with susceptibility rates of 100.0, 91.7, 85.7 and 81.8%, respectively. piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited all streptococcus spp. strains at < or = 16 microg/ml, including penicillin-resistant strains many of which were co-resistant to erythromycin (90%) and other beta-lactams. a specific breakpoint for these streptococci when testing piperacillin/tazobactam appears needed to prevent false-resistant reports using penicillin as a class representative. the carbapenems among beta-lactams were the most active agents against the esbl-producing species of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and those strains which hyper-express amp c enzymes including citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. piperacillin/tazobactam  only exhibited modest activity against the "amp c resistance group" strains (68.8% susceptible or intermediate, mic < or = 64 microg/ml). piperacillin/tazobactam (mic50, 8 microg/ml; 79.5% susceptible) was the most active agent tested against multi-drug resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. against sampled haemophilus influenzae (39.2% ampicillin-resistant),  piperacillin/tazobactam (mic(90,) < or = 0.06 microg/ml), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime inhibited 100.0% of the isolates at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. these in vitro surveillance results from the year 2000 on three continents, demonstrated a sustained potent activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against selected problematic nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. the potential importance of these findings is that this beta-lactamase inhibitor combination can be used an empiric treatment of serious infections in hospital environments where resistance has emerged, as well as covering nearly all isolates of fastidious respiratory tract  pathogens acquired in the community setting.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on protected specimen brush sampling in ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == the effects of antibiotic treatment on the results of protected specimen brushing (psb) in ventilator-associated pneumonia were prospectively assessed by performing this procedure before antibiotic treatment, and 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after initiation of antibiotic treatment, in 35 ventilated patients who developed pneumonia during mechanical ventilation. the number of micro-organisms isolated,  their concentration (colony-forming units (cfu) ml(-1)), and the number of cases  with a positive psb (> or =10(3) cfu x ml(-1)) were evaluated. within 12 h of the initiation of effective antibiotic treatment a rapid, significant decrease in the numbers of organisms isolated, their individual concentrations and the percentage of positive psb results were observed. certain bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzee) appeared to be more vulnerable to antibiotics than others (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanni). this data confirms that prior antibiotic treatment, even after only a  few hours of activity, significantly decreases the sensitivity of protected brush specimen; this effect appears to be particularly marked among the species involved in early ventilator associated pneumonia.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of the new fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin in murine thigh and lung infection models.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci. we used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to characterize the time course of antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin and determine which pharmacokinetic (pk)-pharmacodynamic (pd) parameter best correlated with efficacy. the thighs of mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) cfu of strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or escherichia coli, and the mice were then treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of  gatifloxacin per kg of body weight per day, with the dose fractionated for dosing every 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. levels in serum were measured by microbiologic assay. in vivo postantibiotic effects (paes) were calculated from serial values of the log(10) numbers of cfu per thigh 2 to 4 h after the administration of doses of 8  and 32 mg/kg. nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pk-pd parameter best correlated with the numbers of cfu per thigh at 24 h. pharmacokinetic studies revealed peak/dose values of 0.23 to 0.32, area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/dose values of 0.47 to 0.62, and half-lives of 0.6 to 1.1 h. gatifloxacin produced in vivo paes of 0.2 to 3.1 h for s. pneumoniae and 0.4 to 2.3 h for s. aureus. the 24-h auc/mic was the pk-pd parameter that best correlated with efficacy (r(2) = 90 to 94% for the three organisms, whereas  r(2) = 70 to 81% for peak level/mic and r(2) = 48 to 73% for the time that the concentration in serum was greater than the mic). there was some reduced activity when dosing every 24 h was used due to the short half-life of gatifloxacin in mice. in subsequent studies we used the neutropenic and nonneutropenic murine thigh and lung infection models to determine if the magnitude of the auc/mic needed for the efficacy of gatifloxacin varied among pathogens (including resistant strains) and infection sites. the mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) cfu of four isolates of s. aureus (one methicillin resistant) per thigh,  nine isolates of s. pneumoniae (two penicillin intermediate, four penicillin resistant, and two ciprofloxacin resistant) per thigh, four isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae per thigh, a single isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa per thigh, and 10(8.3) cfu of klebsiella pneumoniae per lung. the mice were then  treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of gatifloxacin per kg every 6 or 12 h. a sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (in milligrams per kilogram per 24 h) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h. mics ranged from 0.015 to 8 microg/ml. the 24-h auc/mics for each static dose (1.7 to 592) varied from 16 to 72. mean +/- standard deviation 24-h auc/mics for  isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus were 41 +/- 21, 52 +/- 20, and 36 +/- 9, respectively. methicillin, penicillin, or ciprofloxacin resistance did not alter the magnitude of the auc/mic required for  efficacy. the 24-h auc/mics required to achieve bacteriostatic effects against k. pneumoniae were quite similar in the thigh and lung (70 versus 56 in neutropenic  mice and 32 versus 43 in nonneutropenic mice, respectively). the magnitude of the 24-h auc/mic of gatifloxacin required for efficacy against multiple pathogens varied only fourfold and was not significantly altered by drug resistance or site of infection.

AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

(10%). considering the germs identified in the various clinical syndromes, we found a high frequency of anaerobes associated to suppurations (51%), interstitial lung diseases (43%) and tumors (37%), while ps. aeruginosa is first in post-tb syndromes (50%) and copd exacerbations (21%),  equal to h. influenzae. in pneumonias, str. pneumoniae was most frequently isolated (38%) followed by h. influenzae (25%). the susceptibility testing of strains of klebsiella and ps. aeruginosa revealed the increasing tendency to resistance to broad spectrum antibiotics, especially for ps. aeruginosa, with consecutive difficulties in finding the appropriate treatment.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == use of computerized image analysis to quantify staphylococcal adhesion to canine  corneocytes: does breed and body site have any relevance to the pathogenesis of pyoderma?
AB  == an optimized system of computerized image analysis was used to investigate variations in the adherence of staphylococcus intermedius to canine corneocytes from four different breed groups and six different anatomical sites. s. intermedius showed significantly greater adherence to the head and neck compared  with the dorsum, but adherence to the limb, axilla and groin did not differ from  other sites. furthermore, there was significantly greater adherence of s. intermedius to corneocytes from the dorsum, forelimb, axilla and groin of boxers  and bull terriers than spaniels and hounds. s. intermedius, and also pseudomonas  aeruginosa, exhibited abundant adherence, which was significantly greater than staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus canis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. in addition, s. intermedius adherence demonstrated a sigmoid dose-response  curve with increasing bacterial concentration. these results suggest that s. intermedius adheres to canine corneocytes by a specific receptor-ligand interaction and adheres to the skin of some breeds more avidly than others. however, variations in adherence between body regions would not account for the predilection sites of canine bacterial pyoderma.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the  most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas  aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.

TI  == [current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ent-infections].
AB  == in bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. s. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. to decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ent-infections is necessary. the new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical  trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. efficacy of  short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. in more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. in more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are widely used and effective. ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). a dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ent-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.

AB  == in the extracellular pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae, transformable by soluble  dna, calcium transport is shown to play a key role for vegetative growth, developement of competence for genetic transformation and experimental virulence. to get a more precise localisation of ca2+ in the cell, we cloned the cdna of apoaequorine in the chromosome of streptococcus pneumoniae. this allowed the reconstitution of the acquorine system and chemoluminescence measurements of the  cytoplasmic free calcium concentration in the bacteria. intracellular free ca2+ is 2 microm at the steady state and can reach 14 microm when calcium is added to  the bacterial suspension. increase in free ca2+ in response to an imposed ca2+ gradient depends on the initial velocity (vi) of the dmb-sensitive ca2+ transport, showing that changes in cytoplasmic ca2+ involve active transport.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == a critical review of the fluoroquinolones: focus on respiratory infections.
AB  == the new fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin) offer excellent activity against gram-negative bacilli and improved gram-positive activity (e.g. against streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus) over ciprofloxacin. ciprofloxacin still maintains the best in vitro activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin display improved activity against anaerobes (e.g. bacteroides fragilis) versus ciprofloxacin. all  of the new fluoroquinolones display excellent bioavailability and have longer serum half-lives than ciprofloxacin allowing for once daily dose administration.  clinical trials comparing the new fluoroquinolones to each other or to standard therapy have demonstrated good efficacy in a variety of community-acquired respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis). limited data suggest that the new fluoroquinolones as a class may lead to better outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis versus comparators. several of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market, had their use severely restricted because of adverse effects (clinafloxacin because of phototoxicity and hypoglycaemia; grepafloxacin because of prolongation of the qtc and resultant torsades de pointes; sparfloxacin because of phototoxicity; and trovafloxacin because of hepatotoxicity), or were discontinued during developmental phases. the remaining fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin have adverse effect profiles similar to ciprofloxacin. extensive post-marketing safety surveillance data (as are available with ciprofloxacin and  levofloxacin) are required for all new fluoroquinolones before safety can be definitively established. drug interactions are limited; however, all fluoroquinolones interact with metal ion containing drugs (eg. antacids). the new fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) offer several advantages over ciprofloxacin and are emerging as important therapeutic agents in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory infections. their broad spectrum of activity which includes respiratory pathogens such as penicillin and macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, favourable pharmacokinetic parameters, good bacteriological and clinical efficacy will lead to growing use of these agents in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and acute sinusitis. these agents may result  in cost savings especially in situations where, because of their potent broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. prudent use of the new fluoroquinolones will be required to minimise the development of resistance to these agents.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of gemifloxacin and fluoroquinolones against recent  european clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against gram-positive  aerobes, was compared to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against 21,464 recent isolates from 16 european countries. gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone against streptococci including penicillin-, macrolide- and ciprofloxacin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, acinetobacter spp., haemophilus spp. and moraxella catarrhalis. this drug was more potent than or comparable to ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin is a promising fluoroquinolone with potent in vitro activity.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == [pathogenetic study on bronchopulmonary infections in 1,416 patients by transtracheal aspiration method].
AB  == we have performed transtracheal aspiration (tta) in 1,416 patients, who were suspected to have bronchopulmonary infection, in order to collect non-contaminated specimens directly from the lower airway. the overall isolation  rates in 1,416 tta were 68.7% for any microorganisms. aerobes had a high incidence but many kinds of microorganisms were associated with bronchopulmonary  infections. haemophilus influenzae was the major pathogen in patients with acute  bronchitis. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most important pathogen and mycoplasma was often isolated in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. major pathogens of nosocomial pneumonia consisted of alpha-streptococcus spp., anaerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa. anaerobes were isolated from transtracheal  aspirates in 20 of 33 episodes of lung abscesses. h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa were the main persistent pathogens and h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and anaerobes were important exacerbated pathogens in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. s. pneumoniae was isolated more from tta than expectorated sputa. oropharyngeal flora bacteria were easily isolated in the culture of expectorated sputa. we assessed the final diagnosis or causative factor in 443 patients whom no microorganism was isolated from transtracheal aspirates. the final diagnosis was infectious diseases in 52 patients (11.7%) and non-infectious diseases in 80 patients (18.1%), respectively. the causative factor was unsuited  tta sample in 81 patients (18.3%), preceding antimicrobial chemotherapy in 95 patients (21.4%) and unknown in 135 patients (30.5%), respectively. the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infections is complex and various microorganisms are associated with pathogens of bronchopulmonary infections. therefore, we should accurately diagnose the pathogens in patients with bronchopulmonary infections. tta is one of the useful methods that we can accurately detect the respiratory pathogens.

AB  == we describe the activities of the croatian committee for antibiotic resistance surveillance and report surveillance results for 1999. twenty-two croatian microbiology laboratories participated in the study. resistance rates for the organisms isolated in different centers varied widely, but certain trends were apparent. penicillin resistance in pneumococci (38%), methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (22%), the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  by klebsiella pneumoniae (21%), and imipenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%) represent major resistance problems, especially in large hospitals. a comprehensive system of antimicrobial resistance surveillance, combined with training and external quality control programs, has identified high rates of resistance in key pathogens in some regions of croatia. the program has heightened awareness of the problems of antimicrobial resistance and contributed  to ongoing improvements in laboratory practice.

TI  == [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial colonization/infection].
AB  == bacterial flora in the subglottal airways: in healthy non-smoking subjects, the subglottal airways are sterile. inversely, bacteria are often isolated from the sublottal airways in patients with obstructive or non-obstructive chronic bronchitis, both during and between acute exacerbations. the significance of this bacterial colonization/infection, its natural history, and its impact on the course of chronic lung disease is poorly understood. between exacerbations: 30 to 40% of all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a stable situation without recent antibiotic therapy harbor potential pathogens in their intra-thoracic airways. the prevalence of gram-negative bacilli increases in the  more severe forms. this estimation is possibly biased due to the involuntary inclusion of patients with bronchial dilatation, since bronchectasia involves a high prevalence of bronchial colonization/infection. during exacerbations: the prevalence of bronchial colonization/infection by potential pathogens is to the order of 30-50%, irrespective of the bacteria isolated from endobronchial samples made during or between exacerbations. about half of the exacerbations would not be related to bacterial infection, but to viral infection. the other identified causes of exacerbations are: occupational or accidental exposure, co-morbidity (chronic sinus infection, chronic pharyngeal discharge, left ventricular failure, non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity). inflammation: inflammation of the bronchial mucosa is a constant feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  the biological and histocytological features are distinctive from those observed  in asthma. polynuclear activation appears to play an important role in polynuclear infiltration of the mucosa, amplified during bacterial colonization.

AB  == a total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 european university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. overall, the most important species isolated were staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. thirty-nine percent of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. moreover, all cns isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. all enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. the antimicrobial  agents most effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. the enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. haemophilus influenzae was susceptible  to most of the antibiotics tested. only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. there are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. however, the situation for patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.

TI  == cefditoren in vitro activity and spectrum: a review of international studies using reference methods.
AB  == cefditoren, a broad-spectrum orally administered cephalosporin ester, has documented in vitro efficacy against many gram-positive and -negative pathogens and stability against clinically important beta-lactamases. we have reviewed the  microbiology and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic literature regarding the spectrum and potency of this newer agent against the major etiologic agents of community-acquired respiratory infection, (streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis), as well as the enterobacteriaceae and non-enteric gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, and other aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. the level of cefditoren activity against s. pneumoniae (mic(90,) 0.5 microg/ml) was superior to all marketed oral cephalosporins and at  least equal to amoxicillin +/- clavulanate. h. influenzae (mic(90,) 0.016-0.03 microg/ml) and m. catarrhalis (mic(90,) 0.06-0.5 microg/ml) were also very susceptible to cefditoren. in contrast to cefixime and ceftibuten, cefditoren was active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic(90,) < or = 1 microg/ml)  at a level comparable to cefuroxime axetil, cefaclor or cefprozil. enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and most anaerobes (gram-negative) were not cefditoren-susceptible, but most enterobacteriaceae, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible. furthermore, an overview of key in vitro susceptibility testing methods and issues including disk diffusion testing  and etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) method accuracy, interpretive criteria, and pharmacodynamic considerations for the selection of a breakpoint concentration are provided. the rapid bactericidal nature of the antibacterial activity of cefditoren, its post antibiotic effect, penicillin binding protein targets, and extent of beta-lactamase stability are all favorable qualities. in conclusion, this orally administered (bid) beta-lactam possesses promise for use against commonly isolated problematic respiratory tract pathogens such as penicillin-non-susceptible pneumococci and beta-lactamase-positive m. catarrhalis or h. influenzae. success in the clinical trials will further define the role of  cefditoren in this era of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == clinical use of ceftriaxone: a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic perspective on the impact of minimum inhibitory concentration and serum protein binding.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is used for a variety of infections such as meningitis, gonorrhoea and community-acquired pneumonia. the most important aspects of its pharmacokinetics include a long half-life, excellent tissue penetration and saturable (dose-dependent) serum protein binding of the drug. a pharmacodynamic analysis [total area under the concentration-time  curve (auc)/minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)] was performed in several populations (healthy volunteers, children, the elderly, and patients with renal and hepatic impairment) against various bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, the enterobacteriacieae, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). auc/mic [area under the inhibitory time curve (auic)] was chosen as the pharmacodynamic parameter for this analysis since ceftriaxone is a time-dependent killer and high peak concentrations are not needed. in addition, there is a significant correlation between auic, time when concentration exceeds the mic (t > mic) and time to eradication. total and free auics (assuming a free fraction = 10%) were calculated since it is highly protein bound. it was postulated that a free auic of at least 125 would be required to achieve efficacy. from our analysis of these various populations, we were able to conclude that the free auic values support the use of ig daily in infections where mic values are below 2 mg/l. in addition, consistent with its reported good activity against csf organisms with mics < or =1.0 mg/l and marginal activity against organisms with mics > or =2.0 mg/l, we also recommend the target free auic values of at least 125 for patients with severe infections such as meningitis. patients with mild infections may recover with values below 125 but they may remain at risk of the development of resistant organisms. furthermore, it is essential to further validate these findings in patients who have received  treatment, calculate auics and correlate these parameters with both clinical and  microbiological outcomes.

AB  == e-4767 [(-)-7-[3-(r)-amino-2-(s)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-1,4-dihydro -6-fluoro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid] and e-5065 [(-)-7-(3-amino-1-azetidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-1,4-dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-3 -quinolinecarboxylic acid] are two new chlorofluoroquinolones with an azetidine moiety at position 7. their in vitro activities were evaluated in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and tosufloxacin, while ciprofloxacin was used as a reference for in vivo studies. against gram-positive  organisms, e-4767 and e-5065 were, in general, eight- and fourfold more active than tosufloxacin, which is the most potent of the reference compounds. e-4767 and e-5065 were also more potent than the reference compounds against all species of enteric bacteria tested. the mics of e-4767 and e-5065 at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) were 0.007 to 0.5 microg/ml and 0.03 to 2 microg/ml, respectively, for gram-positive organisms and <or=0.003 to 0.06 microg/ml and 0.007 to 0.12 microg/ml, respectively, for members of the family enterobacteriaceae except serratia marcescens and providencia spp. (mic(90)s of e-4767 and e-5065 for these species were <or=0.5 microg/ml and <or=2 microg/ml, respectively). for pseudomonas aeruginosa both compounds had a mic(90) of 0.5 microg/ml. e-4767 and e-5065 were 356- and 32-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin against bacteroides spp., and their mic(90)s for clostridium spp. were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. both products showed a remarkable reduction of activity when the ph was below 4.8 and, in general, were less active in the presence of 5 or 10 mm mg(2+). the presence of horse serum or human urine (ph 7.2) decreased the activity of e-4767 and e-5065 only two- to fourfold more than  the activity observed in broth. after an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum levels in serum (the maximum concentration of drug in serum was reached 30 min postadministration) of e-4767 and e-5065 were approximately threefold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was about two- and fourfold lower than that for e-4767 and e-5065, respectively. these two new chlorofluoroquinolones were as effective as or more effective than ciprofloxacin  against all experimental infections evaluated, not only against gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli or p. aeruginosa, but also against gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae. e-4767 was the most effective compound, with a 50% effective dose (ed(50)) of <or=17 mg/kg for all strains tested except ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus strains. the ed(50) of e-4767 for these strains was <or=47.5 mg/kg. against gram-positive experimental infections, the ed(50) values of e-4767 were 3- to 14-fold lower than those of e-5065 and up to 25 times lower than those of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == an observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. in recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. the aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. a total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates,  18%), staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). the susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to  95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. the susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. in contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. we conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. in particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of ertapenem (mk-0826), a long-acting carbapenem, tested against selected resistant strains.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826) is a novel, long-acting parenteral carbapenem. the purpose of this in vitro study was to test ertapenem's activity against a collection of multiply-resistant strains of gram-positive and -negative bacteria isolated from  locations worldwide, and to examine its bactericidal activity and ability to act  in a synergistic manner in combination with other antimicrobial agents. ertapenem was active against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, with particular potency  noted for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic90s < or =0.015-0.5 microg/ml) including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. less ertapenem activity was seen against pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially ceftazidime-resistant strains (mic50 16 microg/ml). except for enterococci, ertapenem was active against most gram-positive species, including beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic90 0.03 microg/ml; 100% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic90 2 microg/ml; 98.1% susceptible), and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 < or =0.015 microg/ml; 100% susceptible). ertapenem was also very potent against haemophilus influenzae  (mic90 0.25 microg/ml; 100% susceptible). bactericidal action was observed versus staphylococci, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae, and at least an additive effect was detected against the majority of the strains tested when ertapenem was combined with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. these results from testing 902 organisms indicate that ertapenem appears to be a promising broad-spectrum carbapenem with  a possible role against some emerging resistant species.

TI  == retrospective review of febrile neutropenia in the royal darwin hospital, 1994-99.
AB  == background: febrile neutropenia is a life-threatening complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy. empirical antibiotic treatment should be based on predominant pathogens and epidemiological characteristics of the treated community. the aim of the present study was to review cases of febrile neutropenia at the royal darwin hospital (rdh) in order to assess the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy. methods: a retrospective review of cases of febrile neutropenia secondary to malignancy or chemotherapy occurring at the rdh over the period 1994-99. in order to compare infections in this group with those in the wider hospital community, all positive blood cultures in the medical and intensive care units were reviewed for the same time period. results: thirty-six  episodes of febrile neutropenia were reviewed. staphylococcus aureus (predominantly methicillin resistant), pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli were the most common organisms identified. nine patients died of their infection, four with methicillin-resistant s. aureus bacteraemia. s. aureus, e. coli, streptococcus pneumoniae and burkholderia pseudomallei (melioid) were the most frequently isolated organisms from blood cultures taken in the medical and intensive care units. conclusions: gram-positive organisms are the predominant pathogens in febrile neutropenic episodes at the rdh. standard empirical therapy  with an extended-spectrum penicillin and an aminoglycoside remains appropriate, with the addition of vancomycin when clinical status fails to improve. when practising in the top end, particular consideration should be given to skin integrity and scabies and testing for strongyloides in aboriginal patients.

TI  == method preferences and test accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing: updates from the college of amercian pathologists microbiology surveys program.
AB  == objective: to summarize the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results from the college of american pathologists (cap) microbiology surveys program for 2000. specifically, the frequency of tests used and the quantitative and qualitative (susceptibility category) accuracy were assessed. design: the cap microbiology surveys challenged subscribers in 2000 with 3 well-characterized organisms for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in pure culture. each laboratory was to use  the test method and reporting procedures routinely applied to patient samples. the strains were national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) quality control organisms with precisely defined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and reproducibility. results reported by participants (2685-2979/sample) were graded for categorical accuracy and quantitative performance by comparing reported minimal inhibitory concentrations (microg/ml) or zone diameters (mm) against quality control ranges published by the nccls. the appropriateness of reported drugs was determined in the context of the type and anatomic location of the infection. results: the tests most often used varied by the species of the organism and growth characteristics of the isolated strains. nonfastidious, rapid-growing surveys unknowns (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853) were most often tested with commercial systems (microscan, 42.0%-42.4%; vitek, 41.5%-43.0%) or with the standardized disk diffusion method (12.8%-13.9%). in contrast, fastidious species, such as streptococcus pneumoniae  (atcc 49619), were predominantly tested by etest (40.3%), followed by disk diffusion (27.6%) and microscan (23.2%). categorical accuracy was essentially equal between dilution (98.9%) and diffusion (99.0%) methods. among the minimal inhibitory concentration methods used to test penicillin against s pneumoniae, etest method quantitative accuracy (96.3%) was greater than that of microscan (92.4%). quantitative accuracy was greatest for dilution minimal inhibitory concentration methods, with more than 90% of results within nccls quality control ranges for nearly all reported antimicrobials. reevaluations of quality control ranges may be needed for 4 to 7 agents, depending on method. reporting errors were also detected in 2 areas: (1) reporting results for drugs not active at the  site of infection and (2) reporting results for drugs tested with suboptimal methods without published nccls interpretive criteria. conclusions: antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods used in us laboratories were dominated by commercial products with relatively high accuracy (qualitative and quantitative). as available methods have become better suited to both fastidious and rapid-growing species, reporting errors have assumed a higher level of concern to the cap surveys in an effort to minimize prescription errors.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1999)].
AB  == from october 1999 to september 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. the breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: staphylococcus aureus 78, streptococcus pneumoniae 101, haemophilus influenzae 104, pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, p. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis 41, klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. of 78 s. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of mic of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) occupied 57.7%. vancomycin and  arbekacin showed the most potent activities against mrsa without detection of abk-resistant strain (mic: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of vcm-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. the frequency of s. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae: pisp + penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae: prsp) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998.  the frequency of prsp was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. carbapenems showed strong activities against s. pneumoniae. especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. generally, all drugs showed strong activities against h. influenzae with mic80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. mics of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all h.  influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with  mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. number of isolated p. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). k. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for  ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis. mic80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. the drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with mic of  0.063 microgram/ml. on the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. the percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in  the last year. as for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. they were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients,  respectively. in 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. it was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. we examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. in patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. however, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased  to 2/3 of the total in 1999. on the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were h. influenzae in 28.4%, s. pneumoniae in 25.7%, m. (b.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and s. aureus in 10.6%. the frequency of s. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. the frequency of isolated s. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. however, that of h. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many h. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.

AB  == in a prospective study, the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) was investigated among consecutive patients admitted to an academic, urban public hospital in seattle. the study population was uniquely young, was predominantly male, and had high rates of homelessness, cigarette smoking, alcoholism, injection drug use, and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. leading causes of cap among hiv-negative patients were aspiration, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella species, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. among hiv-positive patients, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, s. pneumoniae, and m. pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. severe cap was associated with typical bacterial infections and aspiration pneumonia but not legionella infection among hiv-negative patients and with pseudomonas aeruginosa  infections among hiv-positive patients. these findings emphasize the need to tailor empirical antibiotic therapy according to local patient populations and individual risk factors and highlight the importance of recognizing underlying hiv infection in patients who are hospitalized with cap.

TI  == changing antibiotic sensitivity patterns at a university hospital, 1992 through 1999.
AB  == background: the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms is of great concern in the medical community. antibiotic sensitivity patterns were studied at a large university hospital. methods: from 1992 through 1999, susceptibility testing was  done and results recorded for all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus sp, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, eshcherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. microbiologic and sensitivity data were reviewed and compiled. results: over the  8-year period, several common bacterial pathogens declined in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents. most notable were the decreased sensitivities of s  pneumoniae to penicillin (96% to 63%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus to oxacillin (50% to 38%), and p aeruginosa to aminoglycosides [(gentamicin (85% to  64%), tobramycin (96% to 83%), amikacin (92% to 74%)] and ciprofloxacin (85% to 69%). conclusions: these decreased antibiotic sensitivities reflect increased bacterial selection pressure as a result of widespread antibiotic use. a combined approach involving infection-control specialists, infectious disease physicians,  and hospital administrators is necessary to address this increasingly difficult problem.

TI  == late endophthalmitis associated with glaucoma drainage implants.
AB  == objective: to report the clinical course of a series of patients who had late endophthalmitis develop after glaucoma drainage implant (gdi) surgery. design: noncomparative, interventional, consecutive case series. participants: four patients were identified with late endophthalmitis associated with baerveldt glaucoma implants. methods: the medical records of all patients with endophthalmitis associated with a gdi treated at the bascom palmer eye institute  or university of florida between january 1, 1987 and december 31, 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. patients with culture-positive endophthalmitis diagnosed more than 1 month after gdi surgery were included in this series. main  outcome measures: visual acuity and intraocular pressure (iop). results: late endophthalmitis associated with baerveldt glaucoma implants developed 7 weeks to  2 years postoperatively. exposure of the gdi tube was present in all cases. the implant was removed in three of four patients. visual acuity worsened from preinfection level in two of four cases. iop was controlled at last follow-up in  all patients, although replacement of the explanted gdi was required in one patient. conclusions: late endophthalmitis may occur after gdi surgery. exposure  of the gdi tube seems to represent a major risk factor for these infections. to prevent this potentially devastating complication, we recommend prophylactic surgical revision with a patch graft in all cases in which there is an exposed gdi tube.

AB  == background: to analyse the etiology, diagnostic methods and response to therapy in 30 episodes of pneumonia diagnosed in 17 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) between 1995 and 2000. patients and method: in each episode of pneumonia the following data were analysed: age, gender, treatment of cll, antiinfectious prophylaxis, granulocytopenia, cd4/cd8 lymphocytes ratio, hipogammaglobulinemia, origin of pneumonia (nosocomial or community-acquired), localisation, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial therapy and response. diagnostic methods included blood and sputum  cultures, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and search for antigens in urine (legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, galactomannan, and streptococcus pneumoniae). results: median age of the series was 60 yr. (range 50-86) and 12 patients were male. chlorambucil and prednisone were used in 13 cases and fludarabine in 8. granulocytopenia was present in 14 episodes, hypogammaglobulinemia was seen in 22 and cd4/cd8 ratio was lower than 1 in 8 out of 14 evaluable cases. etiology of pneumonia was established in 16 episodes (53%). fiberoptic bronchoscopy was the most useful technique (83% of positive diagnoses) followed by blood cultures (38%). two patients were diagnosed of aspergillosis at autopsy. pneumococcus was  the most frequent agent (5 cases) followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), pneumocystis carinii (2) and aspergillus fumigatus (2). one out of the two patients with p. carinii pneumonia had received fludarabin and the remaining was  treated with prednisone for long time. ten patients (30%) had died: p. aeruginosa (3 cases), p. carinii (2), a. fumigatus (2), mycobacterium xenopi (1), and unknown microorganism (2). conclusions: in this series of cll patients the frequency of etiologic diagnosis of pneumonias was good. pneumococcus was the most frequent microorganism. pneumonias caused by opportunistic microorganisms were associated to the treatment with fludarabin or prednisone and were associated to a high mortality rate.

AB  == physicians should be cautious in prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly vancomycin and the fluoroquinolones, because widespread use of these drugs is promoting antibiotic resistance. resistance is now found in many organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, pneumococci, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. some resistant strains can be treated with alternative narrower-spectrum antibiotics. in addition, five newly licensed antibiotics are available, but they should be used judiciously because of their side effects, high cost, and ability to promote additional resistance.

AB  == background and objective: biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. patients and methods: in this study, bioverit, al2o3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans. results: in the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and candida albicans were not affected. the al2o3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. streptococcus  pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. in contrast, bioverit and al2o3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusions: in conclusion, we think that bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.

TI  == can antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin predict susceptibility to a newer fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin?: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-99).
AB  == a serious problem confronting clinical laboratories and hospital formulary practices is the delayed availability of approved, commercially prepared susceptibility test reagents for newer antimicrobials. a current example is gatifloxacin, a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with expanded potency against many  gram-positive pathogens. this study addresses the use of "surrogate marker" fluoroquinolones to predict susceptibility for gatifloxacin. reference broth microdilution mic results for 29,632 strains isolated in united states medical centers (sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997-99) were used: staphylococci (9,940 strains), enterococci (2,570), streptococcus pneumoniae (3,784), enterobacteriaceae (10,670) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2,668). gatifloxacin interpretation categories were compared to those of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin by regression statistics and error rate bounding analyses. for the enterobacteriaceae, the absolute categorical agreement was 97.9 to 98.7% (false-susceptible or very-major error [vme], 0.03%-0.1%) for comparisons of both ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin with gatifloxacin. p. aeruginosa testing was more  problematic (higher minor error rates), but acceptable at 0.6% to 1.1% vme and a  85.7% to 89.9% overall agreement. ciprofloxacin results used to predict gatifloxacin in gram-positive species was almost without vme (0.0%-0.2%) because  gatifloxacin was significantly superior against these species, especially for s.  pneumoniae, where gatifloxacin (mic(90,) 0.5 microg/ml) was fourfold more potent  than levofloxacin (mic(90,) 2 microg/ml). the preferred gatifloxacin predictor drug was ciprofloxacin for all species except s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, where levofloxacin results had a slightly greater predictive value. susceptibility testing results for selected currently available fluoroquinolones  can be used to predict susceptibility to gatifloxacin with high confidence. many  gram-positive cocci, however, will be categorized as false-resistant by this interim method since gatifloxacin has a 11% to 34% wider spectrum of activity compared to ciprofloxacin when testing staphylococci and enterococci. clinical laboratories can reliably use these suggested "surrogate markers" until reliable  tests for gatifloxacin become available.

TI  == evaluation of spontaneous contamination of ocular medications.
AB  == background: in order to evaluate whether single-dose ophthalmic preparations in 0.5-ml containers can safely be used within 24 h after the first opening, eigth different sterile ocular medications containing timolol, jaluronic acid, diclofenac, ketotifen, pilocarpine, formocortal, formocortal-gentamycin, and tetryzoline-feniramine (farmigea, italy) were opened and tested for spontaneous bacterial contamination after exposure to air. methods: samples (10 microl) were  collected from exposed ophthalmic preparations after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. results: no viable microorganisms were detected during and at the end of the evaluation period. in order to assess whether the resident or pathogenic ocular bacterial population due to repeated handling might contaminate the medications,  about 10(5) cells of different species (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria spp., acinetobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and candida albicans) were added to the containers and incubated at 37 degrees c or at room temperature. samples were collected and  the number of viable bacteria was estimated. the antibacterial effect of the ophthalmic compounds varied depending on the species considered. tetryzoline-feniramine, pilocarpine, ketotifen and formocortal-gentamycin exhibited a frank bactericidal activity (<100 survivors after 18-24 h of exposure) against the great majority of the species tested. conclusion: these results indicate that the risk of spontaneous contamination of ophthalmic preparations after their first opening is low, and that all preparations tested exhibit an aspecific antibacterial activity. as a consequence, the safe usage of  these ocular medications could be extended from the recommended 3 h to at least 24 h after the first usage.

TI  == [epidemiology and antibiotic therapy in nosocomial pneumonia].
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia occurs in 0.5 to 1.5% of all hospitalized patients and in 10 to 30% of those under artificial ventilation. the main causal agents are staphylococcus aureus and resistant gram-negative bacilli, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa. in case of early onset (before the fifth day), haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and susceptible enterobacteria predominate. these infections are associated with overmortality, particularly in  patients with p. aeruginosa pneumonia, severe respiratory failure, shock syndrome or given a poorly adapted antibiotic regimen. management of patients with nosocomial pneumonia depends on the clinical presentation and prior bacteriology  data often leading to empiric antibiotic prescription. published guidelines, for  example those recommended by the american thoracic society, can also be used to adapt the antibiotic therapy as a function of the severity of the clinical situation, the patient's comorbidities, and the date of onset. this type of strategy remains to be evaluated. it would be advisable to base therapeutic management on reliable microbiological data allowing selection of patients requiring antibiotics and treatment based on culture results. currently a two-drug regimen is recommended for nosocomial pneumonia due to p. aeruginosa or  particularly resistant strains.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == a risk-benefit assessment of levofloxacin in respiratory, skin and skin structure, and urinary tract infections.
AB  == as a class, the quinolone antibacterials can no longer be assumed to be both effective and relatively free of significant adverse effects. recent safety issues with newer generation fluoroquinolones, and concerns regarding drug-use associated bacterial resistance have made all drugs in this class subject to intense scrutiny and further study. levofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone with a post marketing history of well tolerated and successful use in a variety of clinical situations. quinolones as a class cause a variety of adverse effects, including phototoxicity, seizures and other cns disturbances, tendonitis and arthropathies, gastrointestinal effects, nephrotoxicity, prolonged qtc interval and torsade de pointes, hypo- or hyperglycaemia, and hypersensitivity reactions. levofloxacin has been involved in only a few case reports of adverse events, which include qtc prolongation, seizures, glucose disturbances, and tendonitis. levofloxacin has been shown to be effective at dosages of 250mg to 500mg once-daily in clinical trials in the management of acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and urinary tract infections. there are data suggesting that levofloxacin may promote fluoroquinolone resistance among the streptococcus pneumoniae, and that clinical  failures may result from this therapy. other data suggest that fluoroquinolones with lower potency against pseudomonas aeruginosa than ciprofloxacin, such as levofloxacin, may drive class-wide resistance to this pathogen. levofloxacin is an effective drug in many clinical situations, but its cost is significantly higher than amoxicillin, erythromycin, or first and second generation cefalosporins. because of the propensity to select for fluoroquinolone resistance in the pneumococcus and potentially other pathogens, levofloxacin should be an alternative agent rather than a drug-of-choice in routine community-acquired respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin or skin structure infections. in areas with increasing pneumococcal beta-lactam resistance, levofloxacin may be a reasonable empiric therapy in community-acquired respiratory tract infections. similarly, in patients with risk factors for infectious complications or poor outcome, levofloxacin may be an excellent empiric choice in severe community-acquired respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, complicated skin or skin structure infections, and nosocomial respiratory and urinary tract infections. better clinical data are needed to identify the true place in therapy of the newer fluoroquinolones in common community-acquired and nosocomial infections. until then, these agents, including levofloxacin, might best be reserved for complicated infections, infection recurrence, and infections caused by beta-lactam or macrolide-resistant pathogens.

TI  == effect of different antibacterial agents and surfactant protein-a (sp-a) on adherence of some respiratory pathogens to bronchial epithelial cells.
AB  == some antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations are able to alter bacterial surface structures and modulate adhesiveness by affecting the expression of microbial adhesins. an important mechanism of pulmonary defence against pathogens is sp-a, one of the proteins of the alveolar surfactant having opsonizing activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect that sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics and physiological concentrations of sp-a  (1 and 5 microg/ml) could exert on the adherence of respiratory pathogens to the  bronchial epithelial cell line, wi26va4. cefdinir and clarithromycin showed high  efficacy, mainly at 1/2 mic, in reducing the adherence of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae strains to values lower or equal to 50% of the control; sparfloxacin showed the same effect on s. aureus and s. pneumoniae but teicoplanin only on s. pneumoniae. other similar results were observed with netilmicin on klebsiella pneumoniae (40%) and with cefepime and ciprofloxacin on pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). clarithromycin reduced the adherence of k. pneumoniae to 80% although it is not active against this strain.  adherence of the test strains was not modified by sp-a alone or in combination with any of the antibiotics used.

(2) the proportion receiving antibiotics before hospitalization decreased with age. (3) there were striking atypical pneumonic symptoms, such as dyspnea and consciousness disturbance in the two age groups over 75 years old. (4) hypotension (shock) increased with age. (5) markers of nutritional conditions, such as serum protein, albumin, cholinesterase, and hypoxia remarkably increased in the two age groups over 75 years old. (6) there were no significant differences in the isolation rate of etiological microorganisms. (7) the number of polymicrobial agents in the < or =  54 years old group was lower than that in the other age groups. (8) mycoplasma pneumoniae was most significantly higher in < or = 54 years old group, haemophilus influenzae in patients 55-64 years old, and streptococcus pneumoniae  in both 65-74 and 75-84 years old groups. (9) the isolation rate of mssa, gram-negative bacilli such as klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory viruses increased with age. (10) the amount of sepsis increased with  age. (11) the prognosis was poor in the two groups over 75 years old because the  mortality rate (over 10%) was higher that for the other age groups.

TI  == integration of molecular characterization of microorganisms in a global antimicrobial resistance surveillance program.
AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program has incorporated molecular strain typing and resistance genotyping as a means of providing additional information that may be useful for understanding pathogenic microorganisms worldwide. resistance phenotypes of interest include multidrug-resistant pathogens, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and fluoroquinolone-resistant (fqr) strains of gram-negative bacilli and streptococcus pneumoniae. clusters of > or =2 isolates within a given resistance profile that are linked temporally and by hospital location are flagged for dna fingerprinting. further characterization of organisms with respect to resistance genotype is accomplished with use of polymerase chain reaction and dna sequencing. this process has been highly successful in identifying clonal spread within clusters of multiresistant pathogens. between 50% and 90% of mrsa clusters identified by phenotypic screening contained evidence of clonal spread. among the enterobacteriaceae, esbl-producing strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae are the most common pathogens causing clusters of infection, and approximately 50% of recognized clusters demonstrate clonal spread. clusters of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia have been noted with clonal spread among patients with urinary tract, respiratory, and bloodstream infections. characterization of mutations in the fqr-determining region of phenotypically susceptible isolates of e. coli and s. pneumoniae has identified first-stage mutants among as many as 40% of isolates. the ability to characterize organisms phenotypically and genotypically is extremely powerful and provides unique information that is important in a global antimicrobial surveillance program.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the effects of physiologic concentrations, at alveolar level, of some fractions of pulmonary surfactant (phospholipids and sp-a) on the  bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens. methods: the antimicrobial agents cefdinir, sparfloxacin, clarithromycin, teicoplanin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and tobramycin,  depending on their specific activity, were investigated against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. killing curves were carried out with antimicrobials at 0.5 and 2 mic, sp-a at 1 and 5 mg/l and phospholipids at 50 mg/l. results: time-kill experiments showed that while sp-a never modified the activity of antimicrobials, phospholipids exerted, in some cases, a weak antagonistic effect. among antibacterials and pathogens investigated, phospholipids were able to decrease the rate of killing of cefepime and ciprofloxacin only on p. aeruginosa, both at 0.5 and at 2 mic, with an increase of about 1 log in cfu. the combination of sp-a and phospholipids never modified the effect observed in the presence of lipids alone. conclusions: the paucity of  data only allow us to observe that the examined antibiotics do not have substantially reduced activity against respiratory pathogens studied in the presence of physiologic concentrations of some fractions of surfactant. cefepime  alone already exerted a small effect, and ciprofloxacin at 2 mic, even in the presence of phospholipids, retained its bactericidal activity.

AB  == we developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. the susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. the combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. the second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. this subgrouping procedure was done every three months. identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals  was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. the algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), enterococcus faecalis (ef), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), escherichia coli (ec) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. three major subtypes of mrsa, kp and ef were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. most of ec isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. although pa and sp had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. this analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.

AB  == fluoroquinolones have been used worldwide against a variety of infections because of their potent antibacterial activity and good pharmacokinetics. in europe and usa, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin showed a good therapeutic efficacy for the past decade by sequential therapy for infections caused by gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. recently, injection form of ciprofloxacin was launched in japan, and pazufloxacin, gatifloxacin, and sitafloxacin are under development. appropriate usage of these injectable quinolones in japanese medical practice should be established from the potency of each drug, the surveillance data of drug-resistance, and the experience in europe and usa.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance caused by membrane impermeability and multidrug efflux systems].
AB  == multiple antibiotic resistance(mdr) in bacteria was at first thought to be caused exclusively by the combination of several resistance mechanisms including membrane impermeability, the outer membrane barrier in gram-negative bacteria. more recently, it became clear that mdr are often achieved by interplay between impermeability and multidrug efflux pumps. streptococcus pneumoniae mefa, staphylococcus aureus nora and pseudomonas aeruginosa mex of these pumps are significant, because those bacteria are more frequently isolated in clinical. in  this review, we described on characteristics and clinical significance of p. aeruginosa mex systems, mexa-mexb-oprm, mexc-mexd-oprj, mexe-mexf-oprn and mexx-mexy-oprm, and furthermore, on interplay between the efflux systems, the outer membrane barrier, hydrolyzing enzyme and mutated target.

TI  == emerging mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  == broad use of fluoroquinolones has been followed by emergence of resistance, which has been due mainly to chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the subunits of the drugs' target enzymes, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, and in genes that affect the expression of diffusion channels in the outer membrane and multidrug-resistance efflux systems. resistance emerged first in species in which single mutations were sufficient to cause clinically important levels of resistance (e.g., staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa). subsequently, however, resistance has emerged in bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, in which multiple mutations  are required to generate clinically important resistance. in these circumstances, the additional epidemiologic factors of drug use in animals and human-to-human spread appear to have contributed. resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae, which  is currently low, will require close monitoring as fluoroquinolones are used more extensively for treating respiratory tract infections.

TI  == absence of bacterial colonization of the airways after therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without stenting.
AB  == following airway stenting, bacterial colonization of the airways with potentially pathogenic micro-organisms occurs within 4 weeks after treatment in the majority  of patients. the objective of this study was to prospectively investigate whether nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy (using laser, cryotherapy, mechanical  dilatation or debridement) is followed by airway colonization or infection. protected specimen brush sampling of the central airways and quantitative culture were performed immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy in 20 consecutive patients with central airway lesions. prior  to therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in nine of 20 (45%) patients. in these nine patients, 10 different potential pathogens were  identified: streptococcus pneumoniae (four cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (three), haemophilus influenzae (two), and serratia marcescens (one). eight of these nine patients had a history of postobstructive infections, of which three were currently being treated with antibiotics. four weeks following therapeutic bronchoscopy, airway colonization/infection was present in five of 20 (25%) patients, each of whom had airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy. in three of these five patients, the same organisms were found 4 weeks after bronchoscopy as at baseline bronchoscopy. in two of five patients new organisms were identified: one case of streptococcus viridans and one case of haemophilus parainfluenzae, both considered to be nonpathogens. in four of nine patients with airway colonization/infection prior to bronchoscopy, the airways were clear of micro-organisms after the procedure. the authors conclude that: 1) nonstenting therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is not complicated by airway colonization or infection by new potential pathogens; and 2) therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy led to clearing of airway colonization/infection in almost half of the patients studied.

TI  == inhibitors of bacterial topoisomerases: mechanisms of action and resistance and clinical aspects.
AB  == the quinolone class of inhibitors of bacterial type ii topoisomerases has gained  major clinical importance during the last years due to improvements in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. these include favorable bioavailability allowing oral administration, good tolerability, high tissue concentrations as well as superior bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant pathogens, like enterobacteria, pseudomonas aeruginoso, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in addition, no enzymatic mechanism of drug inactivation exists in bacteria and no indications for transfer of clinically relevant resistance exist. nevertheless, resistance is being increasingly reported, even for naturally highly susceptible species like escherichia coli. the underlying mechanisms of resistance include alterations in  both bacterial targets, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, often combined with mutations affecting drug accumulation, e.g., by increased drug efflux, reduced drug influx, or both. investigations aiming at understanding the molecular mechanisms of quinolone action and resistance in more detail should provide a basis for a rational design of more potent derivatives. in addition, a prudent use of these highly valuable "magic bullets" is necessary to preserve their potential for the future.

TI  == the microbiology of chronic rhinosinusitis: results of a community surveillance study.
AB  == in view of the rapidly changing patterns of antibiotic resistance, community surveillance studies are providing important information to help guide practitioners in making their choice of antibiotics. for this community surveillance study, we performed a retrospective chart review of nasal and sinus  culture data obtained from 83 patients with typical symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis who visited a community otolaryngologist in rochester, new york. pathogens were isolated in 59 of these patients (71%). the most common were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31% of isolates). among the other isolated pathogens were hemophilus influenzae (25%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), moraxella catarrhalis (10%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5%), and staphylococcus aureus (3%). approximately 39% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to penicillin. some 20%  of the h influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase-positive, and 14% of all isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. approximately 12% of the 83 patients cultured positive for multiple organisms. our findings provide important surveillance information about the resistance patterns of pathogens in our area.  although the prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive h influenzae that we observed  was consistent with those of other reports, we found a lower prevalence of polymicrobial flora. our findings suggest that culture- and sensitivity-directed  therapy should be effective in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of streblus asper leaf extract.
AB  == bactericidal activity was found in the 50% ethanol (v/v) extract of streblus asper leaves. the extract possessed a selective bactericidal activity towards streptococcus, especially to streptococcus mutans which has been shown to be strongly associated with dental caries. the extract had no effect on cultures of  escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus coagulase positive, staphylococcus coagulase negative, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia pseudomeallei and candida albicans. the minimum growth inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of s. asper extract against 10(8) cfu/ml of s. mutans was 2 mg/ml. the active compound is partially polar, partially heat labile, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulphate, and possesses a molecular weight larger than 10 000 da. the potential for using s. asper extract as a natural product for controlling dental caries is discussed.

TI  == interaction of bladder glycoprotein gp51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: a major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein gp51 (molecular weight 51 kd.). gp51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. gp51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). increased urinary gp51 occurs during urinary tract infection. to elucidate the role of gp51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. materials and methods: elisa was performed to demonstrate the binding of gp51 and various uropathogens. immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to gp51 to determine the interaction of gp51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize gp51. antigen inhibition elisa was done to quantitate urinary gp51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. results: elisa revealed that gp51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. immunochemical methods confirmed that purified gp51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. clinical specimens showed gp51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial  cells. we observed a significant increase in urinary gp51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). conclusions: these studies suggest that gp51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.

TI  == etiology of severe pneumonia in the very elderly.
AB  == the etiology of severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation in the very elderly has been imprecise because of lack of comprehensive studies and low yield of diagnostic approach. overall, 104 patients 75 yr of age and older with severe  pneumonia were studied prospectively at two university-affiliated hospitals. microbial investigation included blood culture, serology, pleural fluid, and bronchoalveolar secretions. streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), gram-negative enteric bacilli (14%), legionella sp. (9%), hemophilus influenzae (7%), and staphylococcus aureus (7%) were the predominant pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (cap). staphylococcus aureus (29%), gram-negative enteric bacilli (15%), streptococcus pneumoniae (9%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%) accounted for most isolates of nursing home-acquired pneumonia (nhap). the case fatality rate was 55% (53% for cap and 57% for nhap; p > 0.5). activity of daily living (adl) index, pulmonary, endocrine and central nervous system (cns) comorbidities  were associated with distinct microbial etiology. by multivariate analysis, hospital mortality was associated independently with 24-h urine output (odds ratio [or], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.5 to 7.9; p < 0.001), septic shock (or, 4.3; 95% ci, 1.9 to 8.9; p = 0.0059), radiographic multilobar involvement (or, 3.7; 95% ci, 1.8 to 15.6; p = 0.02), and inadequate antimicrobial therapy (or, 2.6; 95% ci, 1.4 to 23.9; p = 0.034). further studies  should focus on identifying effective antimicrobial regimens in randomized trials.

AB  == to evaluate the effectiveness of professional oral health care in reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonia, we examined the prevalence of potential respiratory pathogens in gargled samples from elderly persons. samples were obtained from 54  elderly subjects over 65 years of age who required daily nursing care, from 21 healthy elderly subjects over 65 years old, and from 22 healthy young subjects under 30 as controls. the prevalence of possible pathogens was determined by culture and the polymerase chain reaction. the percentages detected in samples of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus species, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans from elderly  patients requiring daily nursing care were 63.0, 37.0, 14.8, 5.6 and 66.7, respectively. the numbers of c. albicans cells recovered in samples from elderly  subjects were significantly higher than those recovered from the healthy young group (p<0.001). elderly patients needing daily care and receiving professional oral health care had lower prevalences and cell numbers of c. albicans than did the elderly patients without such oral care. this study showed that professional  oral health care in elderly requiring daily nursing care reduced the cell numbers of potential respiratory pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 41 antimicrobials tested against over 2773 bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with pneumonia: i--results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america, 1998).
AB  == pneumonia is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial infection, and hospitalization frequently is needed for community-acquired pneumonia. knowledge  of causative pathogens through periodic surveillance, and their prevailing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns becomes paramount in choosing appropriate empiric therapy. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, tracks pathogen distribution worldwide since 1997 and documents emerging resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. during the respiratory disease season in 1998, each of 30 medical centers (25 in the united states [us], and five in canada [can]) contributed 100 consecutive isolates obtained from hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia. the 2773 organisms, processed by the monitor consisted  of a total of 35 species, with staphylococcus aureus comprising 25.6% of all isolates and five other species (pseudomonas aeruginosa 18.7%, haemophilus influenzae 9.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 7.8%, klebsiella spp. 7.0%, and enterobacter spp. 6.7%) making up almost 50% of the total. in the us, pneumococci (8.5%) were more prevalent than in can (4.1%; p = 0.001). the us isolates of s. pneumoniae were variably susceptible to penicillin (76.8%), with non-susceptible  strains demonstrating greater levels of cross resistance to macrolides (31.8%), cefepime (9.0%) and cefotaxime (6.8%), but remaining susceptible to gatifloxacin  and quinupristin/dalfopristin. h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were generally ampicillin-resistant, 40.4-44.4% and 93.7-95.7%, respectively. p. aeruginosa remained very susceptible to amikacin (91.3-93.8%) > tobramycin > meropenem > piperacillin/tazobactam > gentamicin > piperacillin > cefepime (80.0-81.8%). extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes among the klebsiella spp. were isolated from five medical centers in the us and were 4.8-6.0% overall; a rate similar to the previous year. among the us isolates of enterobacter spp.,  only 77.6% and 79.6% were susceptible to ceftazidime and cefotaxime, respectively, but >90% were inhibited by cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. isolates from can were generally more susceptible, except for pseudomonas isolates, where resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and imipenem was greater. the sentry program results outline important national differences in the frequencies of pathogen occurrence, but more importantly, identify unstable patterns of resistance to available antimicrobial drugs, and serves as a reference for results of other local, national or international investigations.

TI  == risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients.
AB  == objective: to determine risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. design: prospective cohort study. setting: the trauma intensive  care unit (icu) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. patients: all critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between november 1995 and october 1996. interventions: a comparison of data recorded at the time of icu admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. measurements and main results: the presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (> or = 103 colony forming units/ml) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and  radiologic signs. twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. the mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. the microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, enterococcus spp., enterobacter spp.,  coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (>1 day); use  of h2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (ct) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. the mortality rate was 43.5%  (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). also, the mean stay in the icu, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the therapeutic intervention  scoring system) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p <.05). in the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. conclusions: it seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of icu admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. in this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. at the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of  this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the icu, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity.

TI  == systemic antibiotics fail to clear multidrug-resistant klebsiella from a pediatric icu.
AB  == study objectives: to determine the magnitude of infection rate and antimicrobial  resistance in a pediatric icu (picu), and to evaluate the efficacy of using broad-spectrum antibiotics. design: a 3-month, prospective, observational cohort  audit. setting: a 12-bed tertiary, referral picu. patients or participants: all children admitted to the picu for > 72 h. interventions: surveillance cultures of throat and rectum on admission and once weekly thereafter. measurements and results: of the 150 admissions during the 3-month period, a total of 52 patients  (24 girls and 28 boys) requiring mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 3 days were enrolled in the audit. the median age and interquartile range (iqr) was 17 months (iqr, 5.8 to 63); length of stay, 6.5 days (iqr, 4 to 13); ventilation days, 5 (iqr, 3 to 11); pediatric risk of mortality score, 14 (iqr, 9 to 19); and risk of mortality, 0.03 (iqr, 0.014 to 0.087). fifteen patients (29%) developed 21 infections, mainly lower-airway infections and septicemias. of the 52 children, 7 children carried multidrug-resistant bacteria and 3 patients progressed to develop four infections with those resistant bacteria. of the seven carriers, six patients carried gentamicin-resistant klebsiella. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gentamicin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa each were carried by one child. six of those nine resistant isolates were present in the admission flora. despite the potent combination of piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin, three children acquired the multidrug-resistant klebsiella while in the picu and  became nosocomial carriers. conclusions: only surveillance cultures allow the distinction between import of multidrug-resistance and resistant bacteria acquired while in picu. in this study, two thirds of the resistant isolates were  imported. the introduction of newer potent systemic antibiotic combinations failed to control the endemic reservoir of multidrug-resistant klebsiella and suggests that such policies have little impact.

TI  == acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd)--microbial patterns and risk factors.
AB  == around 25% of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) show some evidence of tracheobronchial colonization. it is, however, probable that the vast majority of patients become colonized at some time during the course of the disease. a variety of factors including current smoking and viral infections predispose to bacterial colonization and subsequently acute exacerbations. in fact, infectious aetiologies account for around 50-75% of acute copd exacerbations. bacterial pathogens are present in around 50% of patients, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequently encountered pathogens. pseudomonas aeruginosa and probably also gram-negative enteric bacilli are more frequently found in patients with more severe airflow limitation. viral infections are present in around 10-20%, with influenzavirus representing the most frequent viral pathogen. only recently, evidence for infection by chlamydia pneumoniae has been found in 5-20% of patients. predictors of distinct aetiologies have only infrequently been studied so far. thus, it currently remains difficult to make adequate predictions on clinical grounds in the individual patient. nevertheless, we would advocate to tentatively stratify the initial antimicrobial treatment according to the severity of the acute exacerbation episode and the presence of individual risk factors. the validation  of such an approach may result in significant progress in our understanding of the role of infection and infectious agents in different subgroups of patients with acute exacerbations.

AB  == ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium. its mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited  (mic(90)) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was 4 microg/ml. ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against mrsa. development of resistance to the new compound in mrsa was not observed. ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) = 2 microg/ml). it was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and  against enterobacteriaceae except proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. the basis for the antibacterial spectrum of ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including  pbp 2' of mrsa, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. the in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. these data suggest the potential utility of ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including mrsa. since insufficient solubility of ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble  prodrug, ro 65-5788, is considered for development.

AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  == multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. important causes of gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation  cephalosporin (amp c) beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. in selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should  not further promote the development of resistance. recent data suggest that because of esbls and high-level amp c beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. in addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. the role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. in addition, several new agents with good  activity against gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == activity of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in combination with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (fic) and time-kill analysis methods. in the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae). in no incidence was antagonism (fic > or  = 4) or synergy (fic < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (fic > 0.5, < 4). by time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x mic in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits mic. these combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. however, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin  against e. faecalis. these findings indicate that, with the exception of e. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.

TI  == inhibition of hbd-3, but not hbd-1 and hbd-2, mrna expression by corticosteroids.
AB  == intensive use of corticosteroids may be accompanied by increased susceptibility to infections; hence, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone on the expression of antimicrobial peptides, termed human beta-defensins (hbd), by cultured bronchial epithelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes. the results revealed that dexamethasone inhibited the (stimulated) expression of mrna for hbd-3, but not hbd-1 and hbd-2 by these epithelial cells. dexamethasone did not affect the (stimulated) mrna expression of hbd-1 and hbd-2 by mononuclear phagocytes, whereas these cells did not express hbd-3 mrna.

TI  == management of fluoroquinolone use to avoid microbial resistance in clinical practice.
AB  == the fluoroquinolones are an important antimicrobial agent class that has been embraced by physicians and surgeons to the point that resistance in some bacterial strains has compromised their effectiveness. in some areas, pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus have developed resistance to many of the fluoroquinolones. such resistance has prompted researchers to seek new ways of using antimicrobials so that when novel drugs are developed, their useful life span is prolonged. useful approaches for fluoroquinolone agents are to prescribe them only to patients who really need them, use newer fluoroquinolones with enhanced potency instead of older compounds with less activity, and perhaps use combinations of antimicrobials for their increased coverage and/or synergistic effect. evidence based on past experience strongly suggests that practitioners can limit further loss of activity and ensure that this important drug class will not become prematurely ineffective.

AB  == mics of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against 3482 pre-treatment, clinical trial isolates collected during 1997-1998 are reported. these data suggested that gatifloxacin was four- to eight-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, with gatifloxacin mic(90)s < or = 0.33 mg/l against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, and < or = 1.0 mg/l versus viridans streptococci and enterococcus faecalis. both quinolones had similar mic(90)s versus enterobacteriaceae (generally < or = 0.38 mg/l, except 0. 7-0.8 mg/l for citrobacter freundii) and pseudomonas aeruginosa ( approximately 8 mg/l). a total of 78% p. aeruginosa had gatifloxacin mics < or = 2 mg/l. gatifloxacin was more active than ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter species and non-p. aeruginosa pseudomonads. both had exceptional activity versus haemophilus  spp, moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. in summary, compared to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin had improved activity against gram-positive bacteria  and comparable activity against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == molecular properties of bacterial multidrug transporters.
AB  == one of the mechanisms that bacteria utilize to evade the toxic effects of antibiotics is the active extrusion of structurally unrelated drugs from the cell. both intrinsic and acquired multidrug transporters play an important role in antibiotic resistance of several pathogens, including neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae. detailed knowledge of the molecular  basis of drug recognition and transport by multidrug transport systems is required for the development of new antibiotics that are not extruded or of inhibitors which block the multidrug transporter and allow traditional antibiotics to be effective. this review gives an extensive overview of the currently known multidrug transporters in bacteria. based on energetics and structural characteristics, the bacterial multidrug transporters can be classified into five distinct families. functional reconstitution in liposomes of purified multidrug transport proteins from four families revealed that these proteins are capable of mediating the export of structurally unrelated drugs independent of accessory proteins or cytoplasmic components. on the basis of (i)  mutations that affect the activity or the substrate specificity of multidrug transporters and (ii) the three-dimensional structure of the drug-binding domain  of the regulatory protein bmrr, the substrate-binding site for cationic drugs is  predicted to consist of a hydrophobic pocket with a buried negatively charged residue that interacts electrostatically with the positively charged substrate. the aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues which form the drug-binding pocket impose restrictions on the shape and size of the substrates. kinetic analysis of drug transport by multidrug transporters provided evidence that these proteins may contain multiple substrate-binding sites.

TI  == adult bacterial meningitis in southern taiwan: epidemiologic trend and prognostic factors.
AB  == in two investigative phases over a 13.5-year study period (january 1986-june 1999), 202 adult patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis were enrolled  in this study. in order to determine the epidemiologic trend, prognostic factors  and therapeutic results for this disease. klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae),  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae were the three most commonly revealed pathogens, accounting for about 48% of the episodes. although there was  a change in relative frequency for the pathogens, k. pneumoniae remained the most prevalent during the two periods studied (january 1986-december 1992 and january  1993-june 1999). multiantibiotic resistant strains have been in evidence since their appearance in 1994, with most of our patients acquiring their infection nosocomially. the overall mortality rates during the two periods were 40% and 34%, respectively. in stepwise logistic regression analysis, only initial conscious level, appropriate antibiotic therapy and septic shock were independently associated with mortality, after adjustment for other potentially confounding factors. initial empirical antibiotics with both third-generation cephalosporin and penicillin g, should be considered for the majority of meningitis cases resulting from infection with gram-negative bacilli and streptococcal species. besides the evolution of newer pathogens, there has been increasing incidence for nosocomially acquired bacterial meningitis for patients  postneurosurgery, with the emergence of resistant strains presenting a therapeutic challenge in recent years. vancomycin and imipenem/cilastatin should  be considered as the initial empirical antibiotics of choice for the treatment of this special group of patients.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) and other antimicrobial agents against respiratory tract pathogens in brazil.
AB  == clinical isolates of respiratory tract pathogens were susceptibility tested against six different antimicrobial agents. the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of levofloxacin, cefaclor, amoxicillin-clavulanate acid, azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 111 isolates, including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and other species isolated from respiratory tract infections. all isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin, except for two isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa which showed intermediate-resistance (mic=6microg/ml), and one isolate of escherichia coli which showed resistance (mic>32microg/ml). only moxifloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were active against 100% of s. pneumoniae isolates at the suceptible breakpoint (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml and 0.064 microg/ml respectively). the rank order of the activity among this group of drugs against s. pneumoniae was as follows (% of susceptibility): moxifloxacin = amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (100%) > levofloxacin (97%) > cefaclor (71%) > trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (54%) > azithromycin (53%). except for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, all antimicrobial agents were 100% active against  h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. the fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were the most potent compounds against these pathogens (mic(90) 0.032 0.19 microg/ml). these in vitro susceptibility testing data of moxifloxacin support the view that this fluoroquinolone will have an important therapeutic role in the treatment of respiratory tract diseases.

AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. it has enhanced activity against gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antigram-negative activity. for example, the mic(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), legionella species, mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), neisseria species, most enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, pasteurella species, vibrio species and yersinia enterocolitica. for methicillin-resistant s. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia species, serratia species, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, the mic(90) are elevated. gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections.  the side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.

AB  == background and aims: the gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria,  a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. methods: antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive pathogens. inhibition of salmonella typhimurium sl1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using caco-2  cells. colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic c3/he/oujco mice. antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo  in axenic c3/he/oujco mice infected by the lethal s typhimurium c5 strain. results: fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were  examined for antimicrobial activity. two strains (ca1 and f9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular s typhimurium sl1344 in caco-2 cells. an antibacterial component(s) produced by ca1 and f9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. in the axenic c3/he/oujco mice, ca1 and f9  strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against s typhimurium c5 lethal infection. conclusion: several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.

AB  == purpose: the purpose of this article was to determine the outcome, clinical and prognostic features, and microbiology of a large group of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) presenting in septic shock. materials and methods: the placebo limb of the norasept ii database was examined. data were collected on patients in septic shock with a diagnosis of cap who presented to a  participating site from home. results: one hundred and forty-eight patients met the study criteria. the 28-day survival was 53%. one hundred and four pathogens were isolated from 77 (52%) patients with 24 (16%) patients having polymicrobial  infections. the most common pathogen was streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (18%), haemophilus influenzae (14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). infection with p aeruginosa or acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality (82%). the only clinical variables recorded in the database that could identify patients with pseudomonas  or acinetobacter infection was a history of alcohol abuse. comorbidities were present in 74% of patients, involving predominantly the cardiorespiratory system. logistic regression analysis demonstrated apache ii score and serum interleukin 6 (il-6) concentration to be significant independent predictors of mortality. patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection had significantly higher il-6 levels and significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha levels when compared with the rest of the cohort of patients. conclusion: a diverse spectrum  of both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were implicated in patients with cap presenting in septic shock, necessitating broad spectrum empiric antimicrobial coverage. this coverage should include antipseudomonal activity, particularly in alcoholic patients. severity of illness (apache ii score) and il-6 levels were important prognostic factors. infection with p aeruginosa and acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality.

AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo), which is located within neutrophils capable of producing hypochlorous acid, is active in vitro against bacteria and fungi. however, mpo-deficient persons are usually healthy. to define the in vivo contribution of  mpo to early host defense against pulmonary infections, mpo-deficient and control mice were intranasally infected with various fungi and bacteria, and the number of residual microorganisms in lungs was compared 48 h later. mpo-deficient mice showed severely reduced cytotoxicity to candida albicans, candida tropicalis, trichosporon asahii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, the mutant mice showed  a slight but significantly delayed clearance of aspergillus fumigatus and klebsiella pneumoniae and had comparable levels of resistance to the wild type against candida glabrata, cryptococcus neoformans, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. these results suggest that the mpo-dependent oxidative  system is important for host defense against fungi and bacteria, although the effect varies by pathogen species.

TI  == reduced ex vivo chemokine production by polymorphonuclear cells after in vivo exposure of normal humans to endotoxin.
AB  == monocytes from patients with sepsis have a reduced capacity to produce cytokines, a state referred to as immunoparalysis. to determine whether polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) can be rendered hyporesponsive, pmnl from 6 healthy volunteers  intravenously challenged with lipopolysaccharide (lps; 4 ng/kg) were stimulated ex vivo with heat-killed bacteria or lps, and the release of the cxc chemokines interleukin-8, epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant-78, and growth-related oncogen-alpha was measured. at 1 and 2 h after lps administration in vivo, pmnl produced fewer cxc chemokines after stimulation with bacteria or lps (all p<.05). serum obtained 2 h after in vivo administration of lps did not influence chemokine production by pmnl from 6 healthy volunteers not previously exposed to  lps. thus, intravenous injection of lps induces a refractory state of pmnl that is not caused by soluble factors produced in response to in vivo exposure to lps.

TI  == [results of antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains clinically isolated at 8 institutions in hiroshima city to major oral antimicrobial drugs, mainly new quinolone drugs. hiroshima levofloxacin susceptibility surveillance group].
AB  == to evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  and enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. among gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. to reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.

TI  == in vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  == purpose: time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and haemophilus influenzae. methods: for time-kill studies,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the mic (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final  concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/ml in each antibiotic solution. growth controls were included. viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10,  20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. results: in general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the mic were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. at 0.5 x mic, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin  and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. at 1.0 x mic, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus within 30 minutes, and s. epidermidis and s. marcescens within 90 minutes. overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for h. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of s. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. conclusion: time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 18 institutions around the entire japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1998 to september in 1999. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100  strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 60.0%. vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. but one of mrsa showed resistance to abk with the mic of 64 micrograms/ml.  the sensitive strains of mrsa to vcm have decreased. the frequency of penicillin  (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) + pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. but prsp decreased, and pisp increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. panipenem (papm), imipenem (ipm) and faropenem (frpm) showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. against h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) decreased in  1997, but those have increased in 1998. inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (ctm) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. a quite few of k. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. the ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70  years compared with the results in 1997. chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia.  administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 26.7%, h. influenzae 23.8%, s. aureus  13.3% and m. (b.) catarrhalis 10.8%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. the frequencies of s. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days.  the frequencies of h.

TI  == pharmacodynamic studies of trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin in vitro against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == grepafloxacin and trovafloxacin are two novel fluoroquinolones with extended gram-positive bacterial spectra compared with older quinolones. the aim of the present study was to investigate the different pharmacodynamic parameters of grepafloxacin in comparison with those of trovafloxacin. the following studies were performed against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: (i) determination of the rate and extent of killing at a concentration corresponding  to the 1 h non-protein-bound human serum level following an oral dose of 800 mg grepafloxacin and 300 mg trovafloxacin; (ii) determination of the rate and extent of killing of the two quinolones at different concentrations; (iii) determination of the post-antibiotic effects (paes); (iv) determination of the post-antibiotic  sub-mic effects (pa smes); (iv) determination of the rate and extent of killing in an in vitro kinetic model. it was shown that both grepafloxacin and trovafloxacin exhibited concentration-dependent killing against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. grepafloxacin exhibited a slower bactericidal effect against all the gram-positive strains investigated in comparison with trovafloxacin in spite of a similar c(max)/mic in the static experiments and a similar auc/mic ratio in the kinetic experiments. no major differences in the extent and rate of killing were noted against the gram-negative strains, which were killed almost completely after 3 h except for pseudomonas aeruginosa. a pae of both quinolones was noted for all strains investigated. trovafloxacin induced longer paes against the gram-positive strains but shorter paes in comparison with those of grepafloxacin against the gram-negative strains. a prolonging of the paes was noted for all bacteria when exposed to sub-mics in the post-antibiotic phase. with a similar auc/mic of 310 for the penicillin-sensitive strain of streptococcus pneumoniae and 143 for the penicillin-resistant strain, the time for 99.9% eradication for both strains was  2 h for trovafloxacin and 6 h for grepafloxacin.

TI  == microbiologic features of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis in taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: community-acquired bacterial meningitis (cabm) is a life-threatening disease that requires prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. the purpose of this study was to determine the causative microorganisms of cabm and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a major teaching hospital in taipei from 1993 to 1998. methods: a review of medical records and microbiologic data was used to identify cases of cabm and causative pathogens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing for bacterial isolates was performed by the disk diffusion method. results: among the 48 adult patients with a diagnosis of cabm during the study period, the causative pathogens were identified in 36 cases. unlike reports from other countries, klebsiella pneumoniae was the leading causative pathogen (33%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (28%), listeria monocytogenes (11%), neisseria meningitidis (6%), staphylococcus aureus (6%), streptococci (6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). the incidence of cabm due to k. pneumoniae increased during the study period (p = 0.012, poisson regression), while the incidence of cabm due to other pathogens remained stable. all of the cabm-associated k. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime but 25% of the cabm-associated s. pneumoniae strains were not susceptible to penicillin g. conclusions: penicillin g alone was not an  appropriate empiric therapy for adult cabm because a high percentage of cases were due to k. pneumoniae or penicillin nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae. while the recommendations for the initial empiric regimen for cabm due to s. pneumoniae in  taiwan remain to be developed, third-generation cephalosporins appear to be an appropriate initial empiric regimen for the treatment of cabm due to k. pneumoniae.

TI  == respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia: frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == thirty-seven sentinel hospitals (29 in the united states [us]; eight in canada) collected bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these pathogens were determined to more than 60 agents (40 reported) using the reference broth microdilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory  standards. the five most frequently recorded species among the 2757 isolates collected during the study were (no. tested/%): staphylococcus aureus (632/22.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (498/18. 1%), haemophilus influenzae (284/10.3%), klebsiella spp. (240/8.7%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (213/7.7%). there was a significant difference in the susceptibility to antimicrobials between the us and canada for s. aureus to oxacillin (50.1% versus 93.8% susceptible, respectively), gentamicin (78.7% versus 97.8%), and fluoroquinolones (49.5 to 53.0% versus 89.8 to 94.9%). amikacin (92. 8% susceptible) was the most  active antimicrobial agent against p. aeruginosa, and meropenem was the most potent beta-lactam. against h. influenzae, most drugs retained a high level of activity, whilst against the s. pneumoniae, only the newer fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin) remained highly effective in vitro. only two antimicrobial agents (imipenem and meropenem) were >99% active against the klebsiella spp. and enterobacter spp. isolated in this survey (possess extended spectrum beta-lactamases or hyperproduction of amp c cephalosporins); cefepime (95.6-100.0% susceptible) was significantly more active than other cephalosporins tested. clonal, epidemic outbreaks of multiply resistant strains were very rare in monitored hospitals. in conclusion, important differences exist between the us and canada in the susceptibility patterns of some respiratory tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents with canadian strains generally being more susceptible to currently available antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the united states and the netherlands. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of ph on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. the mics of american and dutch isolates agreed  in general. the mics of the american gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the mics of the dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. a few european strains of proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high mics. bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. the mics of the american gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the mics of dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to  2.0 microg/ ml. difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with escherichia coli, staphylococcus  intermedius, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. there  was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine pseudomonas aeruginosa. decreasing the ph of the medium increased the mic of proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. the mics of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral ph and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. at a neutral ph, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4  times the mic. similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. a klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin mic, but at neutral ph the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the mic for a bactericidal effect. after 24 hours of incubation at ph 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except staphylococcus intermedius.  against s. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.

TI  == stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  == adherence of haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [gorter et al. (1998) j. infect. dis. 178, 1067-1078]. in this study, we showed that the adherence of h. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). defensins stimulated also the adherence of moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated streptococcus pneumoniae to the nci-h292 cell line. in contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. these results suggest that the defensin-enhanced  adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.

AB  == phosphorylcholine (chop) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including  haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, chop has been detected on pili of neisseria meningitidis and neisseria  gonorrhoeae. in this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine  epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of several species of commensal neisseriae (cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of neisseriae. in an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. despite the presence of pili on cn, which are homologous to class ii pili of n. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-chop antibody. this observation was further supported by the fact that 14c-labelled choline was incorporated only in  the lpss of cn. analysis of the lps of n. lactamica strain nl4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of lps with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-chop antibody. in addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. a concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of c-reactive protein, crp, a chop-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several cn spp. with significant sequence identity to h. influenzae lica. this gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the lps-associated chop in h. influenzae. in contrast, lica-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic neisseria strains tested. they are absent from n. meningitidis strain z2491 genome database. these  data suggest that the genetic basis for chop incorporation in cn lps resembles that in h. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. further, the modulation of chop expression on cn lps, and corresponding modulation of crp binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.

TI  == [in vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, gar-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. a total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth  or agar dilution methods. among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 microg/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 microg/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a mic90 of 8 and > 8 microg/ml for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. all enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of gar-936 (mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/ml). although gar-936 (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was two-fold less active than minocycline (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 2 microg/ml) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 microg/ml). haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 1-2 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml), and various neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.12-0.5 microg/ml) were susceptible to gar-936. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to gar-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.

TI  == bacteria-mucin interaction in the upper aerodigestive tract shows striking heterogeneity: implications in otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and pneumonia.
AB  == the mucociliary system of the upper and lower respiratory tracts is a critical nonspecific pathway for the elimination of bacteria and other particulate matter. the interaction between bacteria and purified mucin of the upper and lower respiratory tracts has been a major focus of our laboratory for the past decade.  we have previously demonstrated that nontypable haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis adhere to human purified nasopharyngeal mucin and human middle ear mucin by a very limited number of specific outer membrane proteins. there have been no previous studies on the interaction of streptococcus pneumoniae and purified mucin. such information would be of extreme importance in identifying specific mechanisms of preventing colonization of this important pathogen to nasopharyngeal mucin. using an overlay technique of purified radiolabeled mucins of the upper and lower respiratory tracts in a solid phase assay with 4 predominant pathogens of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, we  found a striking heterogeneity of bacteria-mucin interaction. the implications of these interactions in the development of otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and lower  respiratory infections are briefly discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in europe from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  == as part of the european arm of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 25  european university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all  referrals, with minor regional variation. of these, approximately 0.36% of e. coli and 16.7% of k. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, p.  aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and penicillin  resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with enterococcus faecium. however, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower  in these facilities.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
AB  == gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens. levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some gram-positive organisms. we compared the in vitro activity  of these compounds against 4151 gram-negative and -positive organisms. gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. all compounds were highly active (overall) against gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being  the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa. our data indicate that the  advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == treatment of gram-positive nosocomial pneumonia. prospective randomized comparison of quinupristin/dalfopristin versus vancomycin. nosocomial pneumonia group.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia is a frequent complication in hospitalized patients. gram-positive pathogens, particularly staphylococcus aureus, are responsible for  the increasing frequency of nosocomial pneumonia. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram-positive pathogens we conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, international, multicenter, comparative clinical trial. two hundred ninety-eight patients with nosocomial pneumonia were  enrolled in 74 active centers in five countries: a subgroup of 171 (87 quinupristin/dalfopristin-treated and 84 vancomycin-treated patients) were evaluable for the major efficacy end points. one hundred fifty received 7.5 mg/kg of quinupristin/dalfopristin every 8 h; 148 patients received 1 g of vancomycin every 12 h. aztreonam at a dose of 2 g every 8 h could be administered in both groups for coverage of gram-negative organisms, and tobramycin was added for coverage against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the primary efficacy end point was the clinical response between the seventh and the thirteenth day after the end of treatment in clinically evaluable patients with documented causative pathogen(s)  at baseline (bacteriologically evaluable population). therapy was clinically successful (cure or improvement) in 49 (56.3%) of patients receiving quinupristin/dalfopristin and 49 (58.3%) patients receiving vancomycin (difference, -2.0% [95% ci, -16.8% to 12.8%]) in the bacteriologically evaluable  population. equivalent clinical success rates were also observed in the all-treated population (n = 298), and in the bacteriologically evaluable patients intubated in baseline (39/72 [54%] compared with 36/67 [54%]). the by-pathogen bacteriologic response was similar in both treatment groups, with equivalent clinical success rates for streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. adverse events (venous and nonvenous) were equally distributed between groups; 15.3% of quinupristin/dalfopristin patients and 9.5% of vancomycin patients discontinued therapy because of an adverse clinical event. in this study quinupristin/dalfopristin was shown to be equivalent to vancomycin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram-positive pathogens. quinupristin/dalfopristin merits further evaluation for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == high prevalence of antibiotic resistance of common pathogenic bacteria in taiwan. the antibiotic resistance study group of the infectious disease society of the republic of china.
AB  == we analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of all clinical isolates of 14 common pathogenic bacteria recovered from patients in eight medical centers in taiwan during 1995 and 1996. susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method as recommended by the national committee  for clinical laboratory standards. of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, 59.3% and 62% were oxacillin-resistant in 1995 and 1996, respectively, whereas 63.2% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates during the study period were oxacillin-resistant. the rate of penicillin-resistance among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 39.7% in 1995 and 53.7% in 1996. macrolide-resistance was found in 71.4%, 42.1%, and 46.7% of s. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci, respectively, in 1996. less than 2% of the enterococcal isolates were vancomycin resistant, but 77% of them were gentamicin  resistant. resistance to gentamicin was also common in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. various degrees of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin were detected in enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and a. baumannii. more than 55% of haemophilus influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. in summary, resistance to many antimicrobial agents in various common  pathogenic bacteria is very common in taiwan. our results implicate that antibiotic resistance in the developing countries need to be monitored closely.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == prospective study of community-acquired pneumonia of bacterial etiology in adults.
AB  == the aim of this study was to prospectively analyze the bacterial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in spain. from may 1994 to february 1996,  392 episodes of cap diagnosed in the emergency department of a 600-bed university hospital were studied. an etiological diagnosis based on noninvasive microbiological investigations was achieved in 228 cases (58%); 173 of these diagnoses were definitive and 55 probable. streptococcus pneumoniae, which caused 23.9% of the episodes, was the predominant pathogen observed, followed by chlamydia pneumoniae (13.5%) and legionella pneumophila (12.5%). other less frequent pathogens found were haemophilus influenzae (2.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.5%), mycoplasma pneumoniae (1.3%), coxiella burnetii (1%), moraxella catarrhalis (2 cases), nocardia spp. (2 cases), and staphylococcus aureus (2 cases). streptococcus pneumoniae was significantly more frequent in patients with underlying disease and/or age > or =60 years (28% vs. 13%, p = 0.002), while legionella pneumophila was more frequent in patients below 60 years of age and without underlying disease (20% vs. 9%, p = 0.006). likewise, streptococcus pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila were the most frequent etiologies in patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit, occurring  in 29% and 26.3% of the patients, respectively. in addition to streptococcus pneumoniae, other microorganisms such as chlamydia pneumoniae and legionella spp. should be seriously considered in adults with community-acquired pneumonia when initiating empiric treatment or ordering rapid diagnostic tests.

TI  == topical antibiotics on tracheostoma prevents exogenous colonization and infection of lower airways in children.
AB  == introduction: patients requiring long-term ventilation are at high risk of lower  airway infections, generally of endogenous development. patients on long-term ventilation, in particular via a tracheostomy, may develop tracheobronchitis or pneumonia of exogenous pathogenesis, ie, caused by microorganisms not carried in  the oropharynx. the frequency of exogenous colonization or infection has previously been reported to be as high as 33%. a prospective observational cohort study of 2 years was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of topical antibiotics in the prevention of exogenous colonization or infection of the lower airways. the antibiotic combination of polymyxin e and tobramycin in a 2% paste was applied four times a day on the tracheostoma. materials and methods: a total of 23 children (median age, 4.1 months; range, 0 to 215 months) were enrolled in the study from september 1, 1996, until august 30, 1998. surveillance samples of the  oropharynx were obtained before tracheostomy and thereafter twice weekly. diagnostic samples of the lower airways were taken once weekly and on clinical indication. results: fourteen children (61%) had a total of 16 episodes of tracheal colonization or infection with 20 potentially pathogenic microorganisms. only one child had tracheobronchitis with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae during the 2-year study. of the 16 colonization episodes,  12 (75%) were of primary endogenous pathogenesis, ie, caused by microorganisms present in the oropharynx at the time of tracheostomy. community microorganisms including s pneumoniae, h influenzae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus were the predominating bacteria. three patients acquired nosocomial bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and hafnia alvei in the oropharynx, subsequently followed by secondary colonization of the lower airways. there was one failure of the prophylaxis: one patient (4%) had exogenous colonization with  pseudomonas pickettii. conclusion: topical antibiotics applied to the tracheostoma were found to be effective in reducing the exogenous route of colonization of the lower respiratory tract, compared with clinical experience and the literature. this promising technique requires further evaluation in randomized trials.

AB  == bacterial pneumonia is significantly more common in persons who are hiv-infected  than in the general population and is most common among injection drug users and  in persons with advanced hiv disease and immunosuppression. the clinical features of bacterial pneumonia are similar to those in hiv-seronegative persons, but bacteremia is more common. when a pathogen is identified, streptococcus pneumoniae is consistently the most common, occurring in 20% to 70% of cases. haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms are mainly responsible for the remainder of bacterial pneumonia episodes in the united states, central africa, australia, and england.  in some studies, chlamydia pneumoniae was recognized as a common cause in persons with early hiv disease, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as a community- and hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract pathogen in patients with severe immunosuppression. although antimicrobial therapy is frequently empiric, it should be tailored to the severity of illness, local prevalence of infections, resistance patterns, or when an etiologic agent is identified. the treatment response is similar in patients with and without hiv infection, but bacterial pneumonia may accelerate the progression of hiv disease. preventative measures include use of the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, especially early in  the course of hiv infection, when it is most likely to be effective. the incidence of bacterial pneumonia is also reduced in hiv-seropositive persons who  use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy for infants and children: guidelines for the inpatient and  outpatient practice of pediatriac infectious diseases.
AB  == in this article, we discuss antimicrobial regimens for both outpatient and inpatient use in infants and children. a substantial number of pediatric patient  visits annually result in the prescribing of antimicrobial drugs. the emergence of bacteria resistant to commonly used antimicrobial agents is a growing concern. information on newer drugs such as meropenem, which is active against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative bacilli, and cefepime, which has activity against gram-negative bacilli including pseudomonas  aeruginosa and against gram-positive cocci is also presented. management of patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies continues to be challenging in regard to the use of antimicrobial drugs to treat various fungal and viral infections. new formulations of older drugs such as aerosolized tobramycin and amphotericin b lipid complex are available. new antiviral agents have been approved, most of which are antiretroviral agents. childhood tuberculosis is an ongoing concern, and regimens to treat mycobacterium tuberculosis in children are discussed.

TI  == quality control guidelines for disk diffusion and broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests with seven drugs for veterinary applications.
AB  == this multicenter study proposes antimicrobial susceptibility (mic and disk diffusion methods) quality control (qc) parameters for seven compounds utilized in veterinary health. alexomycin, apramycin, tiamulin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were tested by broth microdilution against various national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls)-recommended qc organisms (staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853).  in addition, disk diffusion zone diameter qc limits were determined for apramycin, enrofloxacin, and premafloxacin by using e. coli atcc 25922, p. aeruginosa atcc 27853, and s. aureus atcc 25923. the results from five or six participating laboratories produced >/=99.0% of mics and >/=95.0% of the zone diameters within suggested guidelines. the nccls subcommittee for veterinary antimicrobial susceptibility testing has recently approved these ranges for publication in the next m31 document.

TI  == aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical s-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. design: randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after  one or two doses 12 hours apart. participants: forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between february 1997 and june 1997 at the uic eye center. methods: aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. main outcome measures: aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). results: group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. conclusions: mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous mic90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), bacillus cereus (vitreous), haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. mean mic90 levels were obtained  in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.

TI  == mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance: an update 1994-1998.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance is mediated by target changes (dna gyrase and/or topoisomerase iv) and/or decreased intracellular accumulation. the genes (gyra/gyrb/parc/pare) and proteins of dna topoisomerase iv show great similarity, both at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level to those of dna gyrase. it has been shown that there are hotspots, called the quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr), for mutations within gyra and parc. based on the escherichia coli co-ordinates, the hotspots most favoured for giving rise to decreased susceptibility and/or full resistance to quinolones are at serine 83 and aspartate 87 of gyra, and at serine 79 and aspartate 83 for parc. few mutations in gyrb or pare/grlb of any bacteria have been described. efflux of fluoroquinolones is the major cause of decreased accumulation of these agents; for staphylococcus aureus, the efflux pump involved in norfloxacin resistance is  nora, and for streptococcus pneumoniae, pmra. by analysis of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data derived in the presence and absence of the efflux inhibitor reserpine, it has been shown that up to 50% of ciprofloxacin-resistant  clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae may possess enhanced efflux. this suggests that efflux may be an important mechanism of clinical resistance in this species. in pseudomonas aeruginosa, several efflux operons have been demonstrated genetically and biochemically. these operons are encoded by mex (multiple efflux) genes: mexamexb-oprm, mexcd-oprj system and mexef-oprn system. the e. coli efflux pump is the acrab-tolc system. both the mar operon and the sox operon can give rise to multiple antibiotic resistance. it has been shown that mutations giving rise to increased expression of the transcriptional activators mara and soxs affect the expression of a variety of different genes, including ompf and acrab.  the net result is that expression of ompf is reduced and much less drug is able to enter the cell; expression of acrab is increased, enhancing efflux from the cell.

TI  == the in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being serratia spp. (mic(90) 1 mg/l) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/l. gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis being  inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. staphylococcus aureus (mssa) were highly susceptible (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) but mrsa less susceptible (mic(90) 8 mg/l) to gemifloxacin. enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. gemifloxacin showed good activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and anaerobic cocci. a tentative in-vitro breakpoint  of 0.5 mg/l was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. the false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered  acceptable. in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.

TI  == comparison of in-vitro pharmacodynamics of once and twice daily ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin were explored in an in-vitro continuous bacterial culture model of infection, by simulating two oral dosing regimens; 0.5 g 12-hourly (bd) and 1 g 24-hourly (od). three strains of escherichia coli (ciprofloxacin mics 0.03, 0.5 and 2 mg/l); two strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa  (mics 0.09 and 1.5 mg/l), two strains of staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.12 and 1 mg/l) and two strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.5 and 2 mg/l) were used. three pharmacodynamic parameters, t > mic, c(max)/mic and auc/mic (t = time, c(max) = peak serum concentration, auc = area under the curve), were compared with area under the bacterial-kill curve (aubkc) (after transformation of the aubkc) using a simple e(max) or sigmoidal e(max) model. aubkc was taken to be the main antibacterial effect measure. the models were compared by inspection  of residuals and akaike information criterion. e(max) models adequately described the relationship between auc/mic and aubkc and between c(max)/mic and aubkc, but  not between t> mic and aubkc. all three pharmacodynamic parameters are related to each other but multiple regression analysis indicated that auc/mic was the best individual predictor of aubkc. despite this, comparison of od and bd regimens indicates some advantage to od in terms of early antibacterial effect. serum concentration-time curve shape has some importance in determining antibacterial effect. these data indicate that for ciprofloxacin auc/mic ratio is not the sole  determinant of antibacterial effect.

TI  == activity of moxifloxacin against pathogens with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
AB  == a panel of 279 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli with varying levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin were analysed for susceptibility to moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and nalidixic acid. moxifloxacin was eight- to 32-fold more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococci and streptococcus pneumoniae, and equivalent to eight-fold  more potent against enterococci. although ciprofloxacin was intrinsically more potent than the other quinolones against highly susceptible gram-negative isolates, the percentages of gram-negative isolates susceptible to 1 mg/l of moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin, or 2 mg/l of ofloxacin were 78%, 80% and 76%, indicating in-vitro equivalence of the agents against a collection that included  isolates with diminished quinolone susceptibility. staphylococci were analysed according to their ciprofloxacin susceptibility status. as ciprofloxacin resistance increased to high levels, all quinolone mics increased, but moxifloxacin and ofloxacin mics increased less than ciprofloxacin mics. in mutational studies moxifloxacin inhibited more mutants (69%) at a concentration of 1 mg/l than did ciprofloxacin (63%) at 1 mg/l or ofloxacin at 2 mg/l (31%). the study indicated that moxifloxacin is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive pathogens, may be comparable in activity against  less quinolone-susceptible gram-negative isolates (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa), and is less affected than ciprofloxacin by mechanisms responsible for increasing quinolone resistance in staphylococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are products of rational drug design, which may exhibit both antimicrobial and antitumor properties. the aim of this study was to investigate  both the antimicrobial effects of the cyclic dipeptides cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl) and the effects of these cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium in vitro. furthermore, a relevant solvent for the possible pharmaceutical application of the products was sought concurrently. the antimicrobial effect of the cyclic dipeptides was assayed using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion assay against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and penicillium notatum. the effect of the cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium was assessed by changes in alkaline phosphatase expression of ht-29 cells. cyclo(pro-trp) and cyclo(phe-pro) show broad spectrum  antibacterial properties and cyclo(trp-pro) and cyclo(trp-trp) show broad spectrum antifungal properties. the maturation of the gastrointestinal cells was  enhanced by cyclo(phe-pro), cyclo(tyr-pro), cyclo(trp-trp) and cyclo(trp-pro). the activity of these cyclic dipeptides thus indicates potential application of these compounds as pharmacological agents.

TI  == recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  == macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia, campylobacter spp, branhamella spp, pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and s.  pyogenes are found in france and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. ru 004, hmr 3647, and te  802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. research at abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-o-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. bacterial resistance ( such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. the new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. this presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.

TI  == bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in very young filipino infants.
AB  == objective: pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections are leading causes  of death in developing countries. as part of a multicenter study we aimed to determine the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections in a cohort of filipino infants ages 90 days or younger. method: during a 2-year period, 2053 infants age 90 days or younger presenting to 1 of 3 manila community hospitals were screened; 873 had signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious illness, and 608 were judged to have clinical features suggestive of severe infection and had laboratory workup including blood for culture and white blood cell count, nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology, cerebrospinal fluid culture when indicated and chest radiograph. chest radiographs were read independently by 3 radiologists without knowledge of clinical findings. results: of the 873 enrolled infants, 81 died (91%). after exclusion of presumed contaminants, positive bacterial culture from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in  35 infants (5.8%; 95% confidence interval 4%, 8%), 9 of whom died. the organisms  responsible for meningitis were acinetobacter spp. (4), streptococcus pneumoniae  (2), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter spp. (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), haemophilus influenzae (1) and staphylococcus aureus (1); those responsible for the other clinical diagnoses were salmonella spp. (6), enterobacter spp. (3), streptococcus pyogenes (3), other gram-negative organisms (8), s. pneumoniae (1)  and staphylococcus aureus (2). in 685 infants examined for viral causes of their  illness, 223 viruses were isolated from 219 infants (32%; 95% confidence interval 28%, 36%). enteroviruses were the most common potential pathogens identified (22% of infants studied), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (17%), rhinovirus (10%) and adenovirus (4%). concomitant virus identification occurred in 10 of those with positive bacterial culture (29%; 95% confidence interval, 15%, 46%), with enterovirus being found in 7 of these cases. conclusion: many young filipino infants with life-threatening illness were evaluated in this study. thirty-five had infections attributable to bacteria, with salmonella spp. being the most common, followed by gram-negative organisms. pneumococcus was an unusual cause.

AB  == objectives: to define the epidemiologic features of persistent acute otitis media (paom) and modifications of these features during the past 15 years and to investigate for possible differences in bacterial resistance between acute otitis media (aom) and paom. design: retrospective patient series. setting: academic tertiary care center. patients and methods: persistent acute otitis media was defined as aom lasting longer than 3 weeks despite 1 or several courses of antibiotic therapy, with the persistence of clinical and otoscopic signs of aom.  from 1982 to 1997, 475 children with paom were seen in our department. every patient had 1 or several specimens of aspirations or swabs of spontaneous otorrhea (or both). microbiologic characteristics of the isolated strains (including antibiotic susceptibility) were analyzed. four successive series of specimens were analyzed-group 1: from october 1, 1982, to june 30, 1986 (136 patients); group 2: from january 1, 1987, to december 31, 1989 (165 patients); group 3: from january 1, 1992, to april 30, 1993 (73 patients); and group 4: from january 1, 1994, to january 31, 1997 (101 patients). during the same study periods, the bacteriologic results of patients with aom in the same geographic region were recorded. main outcome measures: a longitudinal comparison between the groups of patients with paom and a cross-comparison within each group between patients with paom and those with aom. results: obtaining repeated and multiple specimens from patients with paom led to a progressive decrease in the rate of sterile specimens, from 35.3% (group 1, 48 patients) to 14.9% (group 4, 15 patients) (p<.01). during this period, the prevalence of streptococcus pneumoniae increased in patients with positive culture results, from 18.2% (group 1, 16 of 88 patients) to 44.2% (group 4, 38 of 86 patients) (p<.001). these strains rapidly and dramatically became resistant to penicillin (amoxicillin) (0% through 1989, 76.2% [16 of 21 patients] in 1993, and 97.4% [37 of 38 patients] in 1996) (p = .01). the overall prevalence of haemophilus influenzae remained stable (between 31.4% [27 of 86 patients] and 45.4% [40 of 88 patients]), but the proportion of beta-lactamase-producing strains increased from 30.0% (group 1, 12  patients) to 55.6% (group 4, 15 patients) (p=.04). the prevalences of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus did not vary significantly (from 23.1% [group 2, 30 patients] to 10.7% [group 3, 6 patients] and from 10.2% [group 1, 9  patients] to 4.6% [group 4, 4 patients], respectively). comparing data from patients with paom with those with aom revealed that the increased resistance of  h influenzae and, in particular, of s pneumoniae was more rapid and more marked in patients with paom than in those with aom (highest rate of resistance in aom:  36.0% [271 of 753 specimens] and 50.6% [398 of 787 specimens] for h influenzae and s pneumoniae, respectively; p<.001 for s pneumoniae). conclusions: the increase in bacterial resistance frequently encountered during otitis media is even more marked in patients with paom. the identification of the organism is essential when the otitis does not resolve, especially in patients with paom. obtaining repeated specimens helps to decrease the rate of sterile cultures.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia in the western world.
AB  == background: recently, several guidelines (ats 1993/idsa 1998; ers 1998; swab 1998) have been issued for the initial therapy of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. in patients who fulfil the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia (scap), it was advised to start with a macrolide (active against legionella spp. and mycoplasma pneumoniae) in combination with an agent active against both pneumococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa by the ats/idsa  guidelines, while the ers suggested starting with a second or third generation cephalosporin, in combination with either a macrolide or second generation quinolon plus or minus rifampicin. in the swab guidelines, no recommendations for scap were made. methods: sixty-two cases admitted to the intensive care units of  a tertiary-care university hospital with scap between 1992 and 1996 were studied  retrospectively. the causative pathogens, clinical and laboratory characteristics of severity, antibiotic therapy and mortality were analysed. immunocompromised patients, patients using immunosuppressive agents and patients with a malignancy  were excluded. results: indices of severe illness were widely seen and 37% developed shock while 45% required vasoactive drugs. bilobular or multilobular abnormalities were seen in 34% of the patients. forty-five patients (73%) required artificial respiration and 54 (87%) had an underlying disease. the overall mortality was 42%. in 41 patients (66%), a pathogen was isolated. the most frequent causes of scap in this study were streptococcus pneumoniae (22 cases or 35%), haemophilus influenzae (seven cases or 11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (four cases or 7%), and other enterobacteriaceae (twice in combination with pneumococci and once with h. influenzae). legionella pneumophila was identified in three cases. in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (copd), pneumococci were the most important pathogens six cases or 27%),  followed by p. aeruginosa (14%) and h. influenzae (14%). conclusions: the guidelines for the management of scap issued by the ats and idsa in 1993 are only partially adequate in the dutch setting. coverage of p. aeruginosa would seem useful, given the fact that isolation of this pathogen has been shown to be a predictor of mortality, but only in patients with severe copd or structural disease of the lung, and especially in patients in whom the gram stain reveals gram-negative rods, as is also suggested in the revised idsa guidelines (1998). risk factors for p. aeruginosa could be added to the ers guidelines. including scap as a separate entity in the swab guidelines may be useful.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 17 institutions around the entire japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1997 to september in 1998. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 81  strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 55.0%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous  year's 67.3%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml against s. pneumoniae. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp)+pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. against h. influenzae and m.(b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. but the  sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. meropenem (mepm), ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). and tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa  (non-mucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were more active against k. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients  showing a slight increase year by year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. the tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. the increase of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 24.5%, h. influenzae 21.4%, s. aureus 18.4% and p. aeruginosa 12.2%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. from patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. s. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere

TI  == severe community-acquired pneumonia. risk factors and follow-up epidemiology.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine risk factors for severe community-acquired  pneumonia (cap) as well as to compare microbial patterns of severe cap to a previous study from our respiratory intensive care unit (icu) originating from 1984 to 1987. patients admitted to the icu according to clinical judgment were defined as having severe cap. for the study of risk factors, a hospital-based case-control design was used, matching each patient with severe cap to a patient  hospitalized with cap but not requiring icu admission. microbial investigation included noninvasive and invasive techniques. overall, 89 patients with severe cap were successfully matched to a control patient. the presence of an alcohol ingestion of >/= 80 g/d (odds ratio [or] 3.9, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.4 to 10.6, p = 0.008) was found to be an independent risk factor for severe cap and prior ambulatory antimicrobial treatment (or 0.37, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.79, p = 0.009) to be protective. streptococcus pneumoniae (24%) continued to be the most  frequent pathogen; however, 48% of strains were drug-resistant. "atypical" bacterial pathogens were significantly more common (17% versus 6%, p = 0.006) and legionella spp. less common (2% versus 14%, p = 0.004) than in our previous study, whereas gram-negative enteric bacilli (gneb) and pseudomonas aeruginosa continued to represent important pathogens (6% and 5%, respectively). our findings provide additional evidence for the importance of the initiation of early empiric antimicrobial treatment for a favorable outcome of cap. variations  of microbial patterns are only in part due to different epidemiological settings. therefore, initial empiric antimicrobial treatment will also have to take into account local trends of changing microbial patterns.

TI  == correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and development of resistance in bacteria.
AB  == the correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and the emergence of resistance in bacteria is complex and has proved difficult to establish. besides antimicrobial use, many other distinct contributing factors are also involved in the issue. despite this complexity, there is a substantial body of evidence that the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis and in therapy is associated  with the development of resistance in the hospital and in the community. some examples are reviewed, including increase of resistance in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes after the use of beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. success in reversing the rise of resistant strains has been rarely described. two examples are highlighted, the reduction in the incidence of nasal carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in icelandic  children, and a significant decline in erythromycin resistance in s. pyogenes after the reduction in the use of macrolides in finland.

TI  == [treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  == objective: to evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. design and patients: a prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34  with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. the efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. results: the mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. the most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) e. coli; 2 (3.23%) acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. the  most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) s. aureus; 2 (5.88%) p. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) k. pneumoniae. clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). conclusion: our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.

TI  == bacterial colonization of central airways after stenting.
AB  == airway stenting (as) is increasingly used in the management of obstructive lesions of the central airways. although retention of secretions and infection have been reported as complications of as, the microbiological consequences of as have not yet been evaluated. in this study, we prospectively performed protected  specimen brush (psb) sampling of the airways, before and 3 to 4 wk after as, in 14 consecutive patients (65 +/- 17 yr), suffering from bronchial (5), extensive esophageal (2), thyroid (1), and adenocystic (1) carcinoma, stenotic tracheal burn lesions (2), postintubation stenosis (2), and wegener's granulomatosis (1).  a cutoff value of >/= 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu). ml(-)(1) was considered diagnostic for airway colonization (ac). psb results were related to the presence and degree of secretion retention (sr) at the level of the stent. in five of the  14 patients, ac was present prior to as; in three of these, potentially pathogenic microorganisms (ppm) were identified. after as, ac was found in 11 (including seven patients without prior ac) of the 14 patients. in six of these patients, one or more ppm were present (pseudomonas aeruginosa [4], staphylococcus aureus [3], streptococcus pneumoniae [1], klebsiella spp. [1]). although ac tended to be associated with the presence of sr (psb >/= 10(2) cfu. ml(-)(1) in 10 of 12 sr-positive and in zero sr-negative cases; psb < 10(2) cfu.  ml(-)(1) in two sr-positive and in two sr-negative cases), statistical significance was not reached (fisher exact test, p = 0.06). we conclude that as is frequently followed by ac, the majority of which occurs in patients without ac prior to as, and is caused by ppm. in no case, however, ac was associated with clinical signs of infection. ac tended to be associated with sr in the stent.

TI  == etiology of community-acquired pneumonia: impact of age, comorbidity, and severity.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and the impact of age, comorbidity, and severity on microbial etiologies of such pneumonia. overall, 395 consecutive patients with cap were studied prospectively during a 15-mo period. regular microbial investigation included examination of sputum, blood culture, and serology. sampling of pleural  fluid, transthoracic puncture, tracheobronchial aspiration, and protected specimen brush (psb) sampling were performed in selected patients. the microbial  etiology was determined in 182 of 395 (46%) cases, and 227 pathogens were detected. the five most frequent pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (65 patients [29%]), haemophilus influenzae (25 patients [11%]), influenza virus a and b (23 patients [10%]), legionella sp. (17 patients [8%]), and chlamydia pneumoniae (15 patients [7%]). gram-negative enteric bacilli (gneb) accounted for 13 cases (6%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa for 12 cases of pneumonia (5%). patients aged < 60 yr were at risk for an "atypical" bacterial etiology (odds ratio [or]:  2.3; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.2 to 4.5), especially mycoplasma pneumoniae  (or: 5.3; 95% ci: 1.7 to 16.8). comorbid pulmonary, hepatic, and central nervous  illnesses, as well as current cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse, were all associated with distinct etiologic patterns. pneumonia requiring admission to the intensive care unit was independently associated with the pathogens s. pneumoniae (or: 2.5; 95% ci: 1.3 to 4.7), gram-negative enteric bacilli, and p. aeruginosa (or: 2.5; 95% ci: 0.99 to 6.5). clinical and radiographic features of "typical" pneumonia were neither sensitive nor specific for the differentiation of pneumococcal and nonpneumococcal etiologies. these results support a management approach based on the associations between etiology and age, comorbidity, and severity, instead of the traditional syndromic approach to cap.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing.
AB  == objective: a silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing (ag-wd) was evaluated in vitro for antimicrobial activity against five common equine wound pathogens. study design: bacterial susceptibility study. sample population: equine wound pathogens: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, and staphylococcus aureus. methods:  an inoculum of each pathogen was incubated directly with ag-wd and quantitated after 24 to 48 hours of incubation. to determine if bactericidal activity of ag-wd was contact dependent, an inoculum of e. coli and staphylococcus aureus was incubated separately from ag-wd by a filter and quantitated after 18 hours of incubation. inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (icp) determined the silver concentration of mueller-hinton broth containing ag-wd after 24 hours of incubation. to establish if the rate of bacterial killing by ag-wd differed from  a constant silver concentration, pathogens were exposed to a silver concentration of 6.45 microg/ml and quantitated after 18 hours. results: direct exposure to ag-wd significantly reduced bacterial numbers after 15 minutes for k. pneumoniae, 30 minutes for e. coli, 1 hour for p. aeruginosa, and 2 hours for s. equi subspecies zooepidemicus and staphylococcus aureus. indirect exposure to ag-wd resulted in > or =99.9% and > or =90% kill of the inoculum doses of e. coli at 2  hours and staphylococcus aureus at 18 hours, respectively. incubation of the pathogens at the constant silver concentration resulted in bacterial killing rates similar to those obtained by incubation with ag-wd. conclusions: in vitro,  equine pathogens are effectively killed when exposed to ag-wd, and the rate of bacterial killing by ag-wd is similar to a constant silver concentration of 6.45  microg/ml. clinical relevance: the in vitro antimicrobial properties of this silver-coated nylon wound dressing are promising for future prevention of equine  wound infections.

TI  == relationship between bacterial flora in sputum and functional impairment in patients with acute exacerbations of copd. study group of bacterial infection in  copd.
AB  == study objectives: to investigate the possible relationship between functional respiratory impairment measured by fev1 and isolation of diverse pathogens in the sputum of patients with exacerbations of copd. design: multicenter, cross-sectional, epidemiologic study. setting: pneumology units in six secondary  or tertiary hospitals in spain. patients: ninety-one patients with acute exacerbation of copd were included. interventions: a quantitative sputum culture  was performed, and bacterial growth was considered significant only when the germ was isolated at concentrations > 10(6) cfu (> 10(5) for streptococcus pneumoniae) in samples with < 10 epithelial cells and > 25 leukocytes per low magnification field (x 100). results: germs isolated were the following: haemophilus influenzae (20 cases; 22%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 cases; 15%), s. pneumoniae (9 cases;  10%), moraxella catarrhalis (8 cases; 9%), other gram-negative bacteria (7 cases; 7%), and non-potentially pathogenic microorganisms (non-ppms; 33 cases; 36%). p.  aeruginosa and h. influenzae were isolated more frequently among the patients with fev1 < 50% than among those with fev1 > 50% (p < 0.05). all patients with p. aeruginosa in sputum had fev1 < 1,700 ml. fev1 < 50% was associated with a very high risk of p. aeruginosa or h. influenzae isolation: the odds ratios (ors) are  6.62 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.2 to 123.6) and 6.85 (95% ci, 1.6 to 52.6), respectively. furthermore, active tobacco smoking was associated with a high risk of h. influenzae isolation (or, 8.1; 95% ci, 1.9 to 43.0). conclusions: patients  with the greatest degree of functional impairment, as measured by their fev1, presented a higher probability of having an isolation of p. aeruginosa or h. influenzae in significant concentrations in sputum during an exacerbation. the diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with an fev1 > 50% was low, with a predominance of non-ppms. low fev1 and active tobacco smoking are data that should be considered when establishing an empiric antibiotic treatment for exacerbated copd.

TI  == clinical effectiveness of levofloxacin in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: the relationship with in-vitro activity.
AB  == the objective of this randomized, double-blind study was to compare the clinical  efficacy of levofloxacin at two different dosages with that of cefuroxime axetil  in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and, in particular, to assess the impact of the susceptibility to levofloxacin on the clinical findings. in total, 124 evaluable patients were treated for 7 days with  oral levofloxacin 250 mg or 500 mg od, or cefuroxime axetil 250 mg bd. sputum cultures were monitored pre-treatment, and at 1 and 7 days after the end of treatment. the susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was tested by  agar dilution in columbia blood agar and by disc diffusion, but all other isolates were tested solely by the disc diffusion method. a greater number of infections were eradicated by levofloxacin than by cefuroxime axetil: infections  were eradicated in 68% of patients receiving the 500 mg dosage and in 63% of those taking 250 mg levofloxacin, whereas the eradication rate with the comparator drug was much lower (48%). against all pre-treatment s. pneumoniae isolates (n = 39), the mics of levofloxacin were between 0.25 and 2 mg/l (geometric mean 0.95 mg/l), similar to those of the post-treatment strains (n = 32; mean 1.11 mg/l). all except one of the s. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin g (mic < or = 0.06 mg/l), and the remaining isolate was inhibited by 0.5 mg/l of penicillin g, but was fully susceptible to levofloxacin. some pretreatment strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to levofloxacin, but many more resistant strains were encountered afterwards. all strains of moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible to levofloxacin in the disc diffusion tests. all the antimicrobial agents used in the study were well tolerated: only two patients discontinued treatment because of adverse drug effects. the results of this study indicated that, although there were some failures in patients with s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa infections, resistance to levofloxacin did not emerge rapidly among strains of s. pneumoniae during therapy with levofloxacin, and that natural resistance among pneumococci, h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis was rare.

TI  == susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the nccls disc diffusion technique. isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (icus (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from june 1995 to march 1996. the levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. a total of 310 gram-positive and 580 gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for enterococcus spp. (38 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (13), streptococcus pneumoniae (65), acinetobacter spp. (11), citrobacter diversus (6), citrobacter freundii (17), klebsiella oxytoca (39), morganella morganii (16), proteus mirabilis (20), proteus vulgaris (23), serratia spp. (19), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and haemophilus influenzae (41). the percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for staphylococcus aureus (95  strains, including 2% mrsa) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, escherichia coli (111) 97%, klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. in conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in switzerland are susceptible. the susceptibility of enterococcus spp. and s. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. this compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of levofloxacin against isolates of bacteria from adult patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the activity of levofloxacin in comparison with a range of antibacterial agents against recent isolates obtained consecutively from patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb) during the period 1995 to 1996. susceptibility testing was carried out by either microdilution or the etest, and  interpreted according to nccls breakpoints. the activity of levofloxacin was compared with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, cefixime, erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. clinically significant numbers of bacteria were recovered from 31  cap and 94 aecb specimens. the predominant bacterial species in the cap specimens were streptococcus pneumoniae (21 isolates) and haemophilus influenzae (four isolates). the aecb isolates mainly consisted of s. pneumoniae (38%), moraxella catarrhalis (26%), h. influenzae (19%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). the overall percentage susceptible of the isolates for each antibiotic was: amoxycillin, 64%; amoxycillin-clavulanate, 89%; cefuroxime, 87%; cefixime, 78%; erythromycin, 85%; roxithromycin, 87%; clarithromycin, 87%; azithromycin, 85%; ofloxacin, 95%; ciprofloxacin, 95%; and levofloxacin, 97%. the activities of levofloxacin and the other agents were also compared against 40 s. pneumoniae isolates, of which 20 were penicillin-non-susceptible, recovered from cap and aecb specimens during the period 1994 to 1996. these strains were all susceptible to levofloxacin, but only 50% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and 80% to ofloxacin. twenty m. catarrhalis, 20 h. influenzae and 20 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates were also all susceptible to levofloxacin. furthermore, 20 community-acquired p. aeruginosa isolates showed similar percentage susceptible rates to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro results suggest that levofloxacin may be useful in the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == effects of cd18 deficiency on the emigration of murine neutrophils during pneumonia.
AB  == we hypothesized that cd18 deficiency would impair the ability of neutrophils to emigrate from pulmonary blood vessels during certain pneumonias. to directly compare the abilities of wild-type (wt) and cd18-deficient neutrophils to emigrate, mice with both types of leukocytes in their blood were generated by reconstituting the hemopoietic systems of lethally irradiated c57bl/6 mice with mixtures of fetal liver cells from wt and cd18-deficient mice. percentages of cd18-deficient neutrophils in the circulating and emigrated pools were compared during experimental pneumonias. similar percentages were observed in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 6 or 24 h after intratracheal instillation of streptococcus pneumoniae, demonstrating that no site on the cd18 molecule was required for either its adhesive or its signaling functions during neutrophil emigration. however, 6 h after instillation of escherichia coli lps or pseudomonas aeruginosa, the percentage of cd18-deficient neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was only about one-fourth of that observed in the blood. this difference persisted for at least 24 h after instillation of e. coli  lps. thus, neutrophil emigration elicited by the gram-negative stimuli e. coli lps or p. aeruginosa was compromised by deficiency of cd18. these data, based on  comparing wt and gene-targeted cd18-deficient neutrophils within the same animals, provide evidence for molecular pathways regulating neutrophil emigration, which could not be appreciated in previous studies with pharmacological blockade or genetic deficiency of cd18.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin, compared with that of ciprofloxacin,  was determined for five strains of staphylococcus aureus, including one nora-overproducing strain, two quinolone-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, four quinolone-susceptible strains of haemophilus influenzae, and one strain each of quinolone-susceptible escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and moraxella catarrhalis. in addition, the accumulation of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin by the nctc type strain of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa was determined by a fluorescence method. for all strains, moxifloxacin accumulated to a lower concentration than ciprofloxacin. the concentrations of moxifloxacin accumulated ranged from 12 to 44 ng/mg dry cells. the lowest concentration was accumulated by s. pneumoniae nctc 7465 and the highest concentration by s. aureus nctc 8532. increased expression of nora in s. aureus had no effect on the accumulation of moxifloxacin. despite differences  in the concentration of moxifloxacin accumulated by the different species, there  was little difference between the mics of this agent for each strain (0.06-0.5 mg/l), suggesting that the concentration accumulated by wild-type bacteria has little effect on the mic.

TI  == antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and five gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. the coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microm. this study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. while coumarins with a methoxy function at c-7 and, if present, an oh group at either the c-6 or c-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (gram-negative microorganisms including the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus), the  presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae). a combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one  additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.

TI  == infectious exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: diagnosis and management.
AB  == chronic bronchitis is an increasing cause of significant morbidity and mortality. despite treatment, respiratory tract infection is the most common identifiable cause of death for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. repeated  infectious exacerbations may ultimately cause acute and chronic lung injury. the  most common bacterial aetiologies of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) include haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae. pseudomonas aeruginosa is often a nosocomial pathogen and is becoming more prevalent in patients with severe underlying disease. viruses are responsible for approximately one-third of acute exacerbations overall. atypical  pathogens are causative pathogens in < 10% of episodes. the diagnosis of aecb is  often based on clinical impression, although suspicion of bacterial infection can be enhanced by quantitative gram's stains from appropriately obtained sputum specimens. however, a specific microbiological diagnosis is only needed in certain specific situations. management of aecb involves non-drug interventions (e.g. smoking cessation) and antibiotic treatment. recommendations for antibiotic use in patients with known or highly suspected aecb are still evolving. the selection of an antibiotic for treatment of an infectious episode must consider underlying patient co-morbidities, likely pathogens, resistance issues and individual antibiotic properties. cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and macrolides are all reasonable choices. however, due to the increasing prevalence of resistance to standard antibiotics among common respiratory pathogens, and increased incidence of pseudomonas spp., fluoroquinolones should be a first-line treatment for aecb in patients who have chronic bronchitis complicated by co-morbid illness, severe obstruction (fev1 < 50%), old age (> 65 years) or have recurrent exacerbations. in patients who do not have these risk factors (i.e. those with simple chronic bronchitis), agents such as co-trimoxazole remain useful.

TI  == bocillin fl, a sensitive and commercially available reagent for detection of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == we describe a new, sensitive, rapid, and nonradioactive method involving the use  of the commercially available bocillin fl, a fluorescent penicillin, as a labeling reagent for the detection and study of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). this method allowed rapid detection of 30 ng of a purified pbp protein under uv light and of 2 to 4 ng of the protein with the aid of a fluorimager. this method also allowed rapid determination of the pbp profiles of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the pbp profiles obtained are virtually identical to those reported previously with 3h-, 14c-, or  125i-labeled penicillin. using this method enabled us to determine the 50% inhibitory concentrations of the penicillin-sensitive and -resistant pbp2x proteins of s. pneumoniae for penicillin g, thereby allowing a direct evaluation  of their relative affinities for penicillin g. finally, this method also allowed  us to compare relative affinities of a pbp2x protein for different beta-lactam antibiotics with the aid of fluorescence polarization technology and to monitor a pbp2x protein during purification.

AB  == background: to analyze the etiology, treatment response and prognostic factors in 88 episodes of pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies diagnosed in one center during a period of 30 months. patients and methods: 88 episodes of pneumonia in 69 adult patients were studied. age, sex, hematological malignancy and its treatment, existence of neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, administration of immunosuppressive agents, type (hospital or community-acquired) and localization of pneumonia, presence of respiratory failure and treatment response were reported. for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonias, cultures of blood, sputum, pleural fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal), as well as legionella pneumophila, aspergillus fumigatus and streptococcus pneumoniae antigen detection in urine were performed. univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors for pneumonia evolution were carried out. results: the median age was 63  years. acute leukemias (al) were the predominant hematological malignancies. microbiologic documentation was obtained in 40 (45%) of pneumonias. fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bal (71%) was the diagnostic procedure with highest yield followed by blood cultures (25%). streptococcus pneumoniae (13) was the most frequent isolated pathogen, followed by legionella pneumophila (6) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6). a significantly higher prevalence of streptococcus pneumoniae was observed in community-acquired pneumonia. the overall mortality rate was 20%. respiratory failure (p = 0.0009), existence of neutropenia (p = 0.0023), age equal or higher than 60 years (p = 0.012) and prolonged administration of immunosuppressive agents (p = 0.015) were the prognostic factors associated with unfavourable evolution of pneumonias in the multivariate  analysis. conclusions: the etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies was only achieved in a half of cases. in our series, the high prevalence of legionella pneumophila can be attributed to the special epidemiologic characteristics of our hospital. prognostic factors of pneumonia are related to individual factors as well as to the hematological status of patients.

TI  == bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == community-acquired pneumonia in adults: a multicentric observational aipo study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to obtain reliable data about the current aetiology (i.e. the frequency of the individual pathogens) of community-acquired pneumonia  (cap) while surveying the diagnostic and therapeutic behaviour of italian chest physicians, compared with existing guidelines, and to test the usefulness of the  current severity "criteria" or score as a predictor of disease outcome and guide  for appropriate hospitalization. a prospective multicentre observational trial was carried out between october 1994 and february 1996 by the italian association of hospital pneumologists (aipo) study group on respiratory infections. a total of 613 consecutive patients suffering from cap were enrolled in 25 centres throughout italy. clinical, radiological and microbiological data were collected  and patients were followed-up until complete resolution or death. aetiological tests were not carried out in 204 patients. in the remaining 409 cases, the aetiology was defined by serological and quantitative microbiological tests in 184 (44.9%) patients. a total of 194 strains of pathogen were detected. the most  frequently detected micro-organism was streptococcus pneumoniae (18.5% of pathogen strains) but, unlike in other series of patients, high percentages of intracellular pathogens (32.5%, all with serological confirmation, mostly due to  chlamydia pneumoniae (13.4%) and of gram-negative enterobacteria and pseudomonas  aeruginosa (12.5%) were also found. antibiotic treatment differed from that recommended in american thoracic society guidelines, with a greater use of third-generation cephalosporins. overall, a higher rate of hospitalization and a  lower death rate than in other comparable studies was observed.

TI  == killed whole bacterial cells, a mucosal delivery system for the induction of immunity in the respiratory tract and middle ear: an overview.
AB  == infectious diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with mucosal membranes being the most frequent portals of entry of pathogenic micro-organisms. this has prompted studies aimed at the development of vaccination protocols that would lead to an increased protection of mucosae through an understanding of the common mucosal immune system as an immune communication network between mucosal sites. recent studies have suggested that preferential sub-networks exist within the system and these studies have exploited the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (galt)-lung sub-network in the development of oral vaccine strategies for infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear. mucosal immunization with whole formalin killed pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), branhamella catarrhalis, nontypable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) or streptococcus pneumoniae (spn) results in enhanced homologous bacterial clearance from the lung of immune animals challenged with live bacteria. these studies have been extended to the middle ear where similar results have been observed for nthi and spn. mechanisms responsible for inducing enhanced bacterial clearance from the airways include opsonising antibody, antigen specific cd4+ t helper cells, cytokine responses and recruitment of activated polymophonuclear neutrophils. the mechanisms induced by immunization which stimulates the immune system to rapidly mobilise both innate and specific immune responses during infection are the subject of ongoing research.

AB  == acute otitis media (aom) in children with tympanostomy tubes in place typically presents with otorrhea (draining ear). because therapy is not standardized, various topical and systemic antibiotics of unproven efficacy and safety have been used in this indication. this study compared the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution, 0.3% (oflx) with that of augmentin oral suspension (aug) in pediatric subjects 1-12 years of age with tympanostomy tubes and acute purulent otorrhea. subjects were randomized to receive 10d of oflx, 0.25 ml topically bid, or of aug, 40 mg/kg per day. audiometry was performed in subjects  > or =4 years of age. overall cure rate for clinically evaluable subjects was 76% with oflx (n = 140) and 69% with aug (n = 146; p = 0.169). overall eradication rates for oflx and aug were similar for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis and were superior with oflx for staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p<0.05 for both). oflx had a greater overall pathogen eradication rate (96% vs. 67%; p<0.001). treatment-related adverse event rates were 31% for aug and 6% for oflx (p<0.001). neither treatment significantly altered hearing acuity. topical ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 0.25 ml bid was as effective and better tolerated than systemic therapy with augmentin oral suspension 40 mg/kg per day in treating aom in children with tympanostomy tubes.

TI  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents: an overview from korea.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance of bacteria has become a worldwide problem. available data suggest that the resistance problem is comparatively more serious in korea.  in large hospitals, the proportion of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has been reported at over 70%, and of penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at around 70%. infection or colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has started to increase. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae has become widespread and even carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa has been increasing. community-acquired pathogens such as salmonella, shigella and neisseria gonorrhoeae are often resistant to various antimicrobial agents. the prevalence of resistant bacteria can lead to erroneous empirical selection of either noneffective or expensive drugs, prolonging hospitalization and higher mortality. the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria are unavoidable unless  antimicrobial agents are not used at all. the high prevalence of resistant bacteria in korea seems to be related to antibiotic usage: 1) easy availability without prescription at drug stores, 2) injudicious use in hospitals, and 3) uncontrolled use in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries. nosocomial infection is an important factor in the spread of resistant bacteria. antimicrobial resistance problems should be regarded as the major public health concern in korea. it is urgently required to ban the sale of antibiotics without  prescription, to use antibiotics more judiciously in hospitals by intensive teaching of the principles of the use of antibiotics, and to establish better control measures of nosocomial infections. regulation of antimicrobials for other than human use should also be required. these issues are not easy to address and  require the collective action of governments, the pharmaceutical industry, health care providers, and consumers.

TI  == commentary on the 1993 american thoracic society guidelines for the treatment of  community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == early treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is associated with improved outcome. since extensive diagnostic testing identifies an etiologic agent in only half of the cases and usually requires several hours or even days for results, cap is most often initially treated empirically. in 1993, the american thoracic society (ats) established guidelines to assist primary care physicians in antibiotic selection for the initial empiric treatment of cap in immunocompetent  adults. since publication of the guidelines, the incidence of certain bacteria has been redefined, antimicrobial resistance patterns have changed, risk factors  for stratifying need for hospitalization have been further defined, and newer antibiotics have been introduced. these changes necessitate a reevaluation of the 1993 ats guidelines. this article proposes a modification of the ats guidelines.  this modification continues to classify patients into groups, based on specific risk factors, to which a limited number of likely pathogens are identified and for which antibiotic treatment regimens are developed. the modification differs from the original ats guidelines because of the changes in risk factors. patient  groups are still broadly divided into outpatient and inpatient care, but earlier  risk factors of age and coexisting illness have been refined. risk factors suggested herein as considerations to guide treatment include the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, history of smoking, severity of illness, risk of drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and need for  icu admission.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

TI  == the biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. the aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). the enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. the induction of  differentiation in ht-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. antibiotic properties against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilus and streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion assay. results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. three of  the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. all the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. these results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == the role of anaerobes in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia: a prospective study.
AB  == context: aspiration of oropharyngeal material, with its high concentration of anaerobic bacteria, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and aspiration pneumonitis (ap). consequently, patients with these disorders are usually treated with antimicrobial agents with anaerobic activity. objective: to determine the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in patients with vap and ap. design: prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study. setting: university-affiliated community teaching hospital. patients and interventions: we performed sequential blind protected specimen brush (psb) sampling and mini-bal in 143 patients with 185 episodes of suspected vap and 25 patients with ap who required mechanical ventilation. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on all specimens. pneumonia was considered to be present when either > 500 cfu/ml cultured from blind psb sampling or > 5,000 cfu/ml cultured from mini-bal were present. results: using the predefined criteria, bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 63 of 185 suspected vap episodes (34%) and 12 of 25 patients with ap (48%). at least one dose of an antibiotic was given in the 24 h prior to bacteriologic sampling in 106 suspected vap episodes (57%) and in 12 patients with ap (48%). more than one pathogen was isolated from 11 vap and four ap patients. pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enteric gram-negative organisms were isolated most frequently from patients with vap. in  the patients with ap, enteric gram-negative organisms were isolated in patients with gi disorders and streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae predominated in patients with "community-acquired" aspiration. only one anaerobic organism was isolated from the entire group of patients; veillonella paravula was isolated from a blind psb specimen in a patient with suspected aspiration pneumonia. conclusion: despite painstaking effort, we were able to isolate only one anaerobic organism (nonpathogenic) from this group of patients. the spectrum  of aerobes in patients with vap was similar to that reported in the literature. the organisms found in patients with ap was a reflection of the organisms likely  to colonize the oropharynx. the use of antibiotics with anaerobic coverage may not be necessary in patients with suspected vap and ap. furthermore, penicillin g and clindamycin may not be the antibiotics of choice in patients with ap.

TI  == [epidemiology of sinusitis seen in hospitalized patients. apropos of 77 episodes  of sinusitis among 72 patients between 1993 and 1996].
AB  == the 77 cases of sinusitis seen in 72 patients admitted to the briancon hospital between january 1, 1993, and june 30, 1996, were studied. one or both maxillary sinuses were involved in 96.8% of cases. sinus aspiration was done in 95 cases. all aspirates were subjected to microbiological studies. of the 45 aspirates that yielded positive cultures, 36 grew one or more pathogenic organisms. the most commonly isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 5), and haemophilus influenzae (n = 5). nosocomial sinusitis defined on a set of criteria including hospital stay duration at onset and an acute tempo of evolution contributed 32.5% of cases overall, 55.2% in the intensive care unit and 18.7% in all other departments combined. nosocomial cases in the intensive care unit were associated with well-known risk factors, namely tracheal intubation with ventilation and presence of a nasogastric tube. other study criteria included the type of organism recovered by culture and whether patients ventilated via a tracheal tube had the same organism in their sinus and  tracheal tube aspirates. some nonintensive care patients had none of the known risk factors for sinusitis; prompt diagnosis and treatment of these cases of sinusitis is important to avoid infectious complications, which are, however, less common than in intensive care patients.

TI  == [virulence and its relationship to antibiotic resistance].
AB  == pathogenic islands: certain dna blocks inserted into the chromosome of most gram  negative bacteria originated in pathogens found in plants. virulence-antibiotic interactions: during the invasive phase, the bacterial cell covers itself with adhesins which facilitate its adherence to tissues. the bacterial cell produces a fibronectin which protects its defense systems. antibiotics favor bacterial resistance by increasing the expression of surface adhesins and fibronectin production. penicillin resistant pneumococci: experimental models have demonstrated that mortality in mice and host resistance to pneumococcal infection are related to the type of capsule and not to antibiotic resistance. quorum sensing: the bacterial inoculum regulates the production of virulence factors in  vivo via quorum sensing. this regulation can play an important role in pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. acinetobacter baumanni virulence: long poorly  understood, factors favoring a. baumanni virulence appear to result from bacterial production of iromps in the extracellular growth medium in response to  iron depletion during the exponential growth phase.

AB  == the susceptibility of 492 enterobacteriaceae, 227 other gram-negative bacteria, 448 gram-positive bacteria and 108 anaerobic organisms was determined by the agar dilution method against trovafloxacin and other antibiotics. trovafloxacin was highly active against most of the enterobacteriaceae including enterobacter spp.  and citrobacter spp. [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 <1 mg/l], acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 = 0.25 and 2 mg/l, respectively). the antimicrobial activity was extended to the gram-positive bacteria including streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus with mic90 <1 mg/l. enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were inhibited (mic90 = 2 mg/l; sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 16 and 64 mg/l, respectively). almost all anaerobic organisms were inhibited by trovafloxacin (mic90 = 1 mg/l).

AB  == in a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern viet nam. gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly salmonella typhi (67%), sal. para-typhi a (3%), escherichia coli (10%), and klebsiella spp. (5%). other salmonella spp. (1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and haemophilus  influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common gram-positive isolates. patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (p < 0.001) and had a lower mortality  rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; p < 0.0001). over 70% of the sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. multidrug-resistant sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in viet nam.

TI  == epidemiology of ventilator-acquired pneumonia based on protected bronchoscopic sampling.
AB  == we performed a prospective observational cohort study of the epidemiology and etiology of nosocomial pneumonia in 358 medical icu patients in two university-affiliated hospitals. protected bronchoscopic techniques (protected specimen brush and bronchoalveolar lavage) were used for diagnosis to minimize misclassification. risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. twenty-eight cases of pneumonia occurred in 358 patients for a cumulative incidence of 7.8% and incidence rates of 12.5 cases per 1, 000 patient days and 20.5 cases per 1,000 ventilator days. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and hemophilus species made up 65% of isolates from the lower respiratory tract, whereas only 12.5% of isolates were enteric gram-negative bacilli. daily surveillance cultures of the nares, oropharynx, trachea, and stomach demonstrated that tracheal colonization preceded ventilator-associated pneumonia in 93.5%, whereas gastric colonization preceded tracheal colonization for only four of 31 (13%) eventual pathogens. by multiple logistic regression, independent risk factors for ventilator- associated pneumonia were admission serum albumin <= 2.2 g/dl (odds ratio [or] 5.9; 95% confidence interval [ci] 2.0-17.6; p = 0.0013), maximum positive end-expiratory pressure >= 7.5 cm h2o (or, 4.6; 95% ci, 1.4 to 15.1; p = 0.012), absence of antibiotic therapy (or, 6.7; 95% ci, 1.8 to 25.3; p = 0.0054), colonization of the upper respiratory tract by respiratory gram-negative bacilli (or, 3.4; 95% ci, 1.1 to 10.1; p = 0.028), pack-years of smoking (or, 2.3 for 50 pack-years; 95% ci, 1. 2 to 4.2; p  = 0.012), and duration of mechanical ventilation (or, 3. 4 for 14 d; 95% ci, 1.5  to 7.8; p = 0.0044). several of these risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia appear amenable to intervention.

AB  == although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) appears beneficial in patients with a  history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. in a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (cip) 750 mg and clarithromycin (cla) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with aecb  (1083 cip, 1097 cla). patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe aecb episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for aecb within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. the majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). mean patient age was 62 years. a history of at least three aecb episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of cip-treated patients and 53% of cla-treated patients. of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included haemophilus species, 28%; moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; enterobacteriaceae, 18%; staphylococcus aureus, 17%; streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of haemophilus influenzae, 10% of haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of m catarrhalis isolates. thirty-four percent of s pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/l). among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for cip versus 90% and 96% for cla. the differences between cip and cla did not reach statistical significance. superinfections were  reported significantly more frequently in cla-treated (3%) versus cip-treated patients (1%). eradication rates for specific organisms for cip and cla, respectively, were haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; m catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; s pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of cip-treated patients and 10% of cla-treated patients. cip 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than cla 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe aecb. the causative bacterial pathogens of aecb appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with aecb should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == airways microbial flora in copd patients in stable clinical conditions and during exacerbations: a bronchoscopic investigation.
AB  == patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) undergo frequent exacerbations of their illness characterized by increased cough and expectoration. the precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. in  the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. thus, we performed  fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (psb) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with copd, 16 with stable  clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. the aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with copd exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) colony forming units.ml-1). the predominant bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aerococcus viridans and chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). although significant  bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == gamma 3 gene-disrupted mice selectively deficient in the dominant igg subclass made to bacterial polysaccharides undergo normal isotype switching after immunization with polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines.
AB  == bacterial polysaccharides (ps) are t-independent type 2 ags that elicit restricted ab responses of igm and igg3 in mice and igm and predominantly igg2 in humans. immunodeficiency in the dominant igg subclass made to ps is associated with chronic sinus and pulmonary infections with ps-encapsulated bacteria. to elucidate the biologic role of the dominant igg subclass in the immune response to ps and to make an animal model of human igg subclass deficiency, we generated  mice with a targeted disruption of the exon encoding the ch1 domain of the gamma  3 heavy-chain constant region gene. homozygotes had no detectable serum igg3, and their splenocytes did not produce igg3 after lps stimulation. igg3(-/-) mice immunized with ps from pseudomonas aeruginosa lps o-side chain or streptococcus pneumoniae type 19f capsule did not produce any igg3 anti-ps abs, in contrast to  wild-type mice in which igg3 was the major igg subclass. immunizing both wild-type and igg3(-/-) mice with 19f ps-protein conjugate elicited igg1 abs. we  conclude that igg3(-/-) mice have a selective deficiency in the dominant murine igg subclass made to t-independent type 2 ags and may be a useful animal model of igg subclass deficiency. in addition, we show that the anti-ps ab class switching to igg1 that occurs when mice are immunized with a ps-protein conjugate vaccine does not require sequential ig expression or an intact, upstream gamma 3 heavy-chain gene.

AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. in this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms  isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source  of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. the incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. a total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas escherichia coli (6%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), klebsiella  aerogenes (3.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. the two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). the overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of enterobacter cloacae. it is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1996)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 16 institutions around the entire japan, 557 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 449 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1996 to september 1997. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 98 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 93 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 84 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 84 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 17 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 31 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 21 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 67.3%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased comparing to the previous year's 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest activities  against both s. aureus and mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. faropenem (frpm) showed the next potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. the other drugs except erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm) and tetracycline (tc) were active against s. pneumoniae tested with mic80s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. 3) h. influenzae the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested with mic80s  of 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cefmenoxime (cmx), cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) tobramycin (tob) showed the most  potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs), ipm, gentamicin (gm), abk and  ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the next potent activities, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) tob and cpfx showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80s of piperacillin (pipc) and cefoperazone (cpz) were 16 micrograms/ml in 1995, and they were 64 micrograms/ml in 1996. 6) k. pneumoniae all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. cmx, cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop) and carumonam (crmn) showed the most potent activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m.(b) catarrhalis against m.(b.) catarrhalis, all drugs showed good activities with mics of 4 micrograms/ml or below. ipm and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activities with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to  year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examined for 557 isolates  from 449 cases. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 71.0% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportions of diagnosed diseases were as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 35.9% and 30.3% respectively. they were followed by bronchiectasis with a proportion of 10.

TI  == comparison of the modified stokes' method of susceptibility testing with results  obtained using mic methods and british society of antimicrobial chemotherapy breakpoints.
AB  == the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories in the uk use comparative disc diffusion methods based on the stokes' method to determine antibiotic susceptibility. the technical validity of the results obtained from the modified  stokes' method of disc testing and how they relate to mic data are not known. we  studied susceptibility testing using a modified stokes' disc diffusion method for a wide range of clinical isolates against which mics had been determined by collaborators not involved with the disc testing evaluation. results indicated that for 1301 organism-antibiotic combinations the number of major errors (where  resistant strains were reported as sensitive) was 21/468 (4.4%) and the number of minor errors (where sensitive strains were reported as resistant) was 14/713 (1.9%) using ciprofloxacin breakpoints of 0.5 and 2 mg/l. there was good correlation between the disc susceptibility test and the mic for 119 isolates of  enterobacteriaceae tested with the exception of serratia spp. excluding serratia  spp. the number of major errors for enterobacteriaceae was 1/200 (0.5%). data revealed 2/25 (8%) major errors for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1/45 (2.2%) for acinetobacter spp. haemophilus influenzae showed a number of unexpected categorization errors. the modified stokes' method performed accurately for staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci when tested for susceptibility to gentamicin, erythromycin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. no major  errors were reported for streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-haemolytic streptococci. problems occurred with the detection of antibiotic resistance in enterococcus spp. major errors were seen for ampicillin (2/12 strains), teicoplanin (5/6 strains) and vancomycin (5/13 strains) using a 30 microg disc but only 1/13 strains using a 5 microg disc. overall, from our data, the modified stokes' disc diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test showed an unacceptable number of major errors but an acceptable number of minor errors.

TI  == interactions of plaunotol with bacterial membranes.
AB  == plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, has a bactericidal effect against helicobacter pylori, which may result from interaction of this compound with the  bacterial cell membrane. the purpose of the present study was to confirm that plaunotol interacts with the h. pylori membrane. membrane fluidities were measured using two stearic acid spin labels, namely 5-doxyl-stearic acid (in which the nitroxide group is located in the upper portion of the bacterial cell membrane) and 16-doxyl-stearic acid methyl ester (in which the nitroxide group is located deeper in the bacterial cell membrane), by means of electron spin resonance. the membrane fluidities of plaunotol-treated cells were significantly  increased in the measurements made using the two spin labels. we also attempted to isolate plaunotol-resistant h. pylori in vitro by two different methods. to assess the level of resistance that could be reached, h. pylori was passaged five times on an agar plate containing subinhibitory concentrations of plaunotol or metronidazole. to measure the rate of development of resistance, h. pylori was grown with subinhibitory concentrations (0.25 x mic) of plaunotol or metronidazole, and quantitatively plated on to medium containing 4 x mic of the compounds. this treatment was repeated once more. no plaunotol-resistant colonies were selected by the two methods. h. pylori developed resistance to metronidazole easily and at a relatively high rate. the mechanism by which plaunotol directly fluidizes and destroys the h. pylori membrane might make it difficult for this organism to develop resistance to plaunotol. it was confirmed that the bactericidal effects of plaunotol were also shown against staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. no such effect was seen against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the phosphorylcholine epitope undergoes phase variation on a 43-kilodalton protein in pseudomonas aeruginosa and on pili of neisseria meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (chop) is a component of the teichoic acids of streptococcus pneumoniae and has been recently identified on the lipopolysaccharide of haemophilus influenzae, also a major pathogen of the human respiratory tract. other gram-negative pathogens that frequently infect the human respiratory tract  were surveyed for the presence of the chop epitope as indicated by binding to monoclonal antibodies (mabs) recognizing this structure. the chop epitope was found on a 43-kda protein on all clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa examined and on several class i and ii pili of neisseria meningitidis. the specificity of the anti-chop mab was demonstrated by the inhibition of binding in the presence of chop but not structural analogs. as in the case of h. influenzae, the expression of this epitope was phase variable on these species. in p. aeruginosa, this epitope was expressed at detectable levels only at lower growth  temperatures. expression of the chop epitope on piliated neisseriae displayed phase variation, both linked to pilus expression and independently of fully piliated bacteria.

TI  == activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of bush group 1 beta-lactamases. in vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli was studied. methods: the agar dilution method described by the us national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. these included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the tested clinical isolates included gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, group d enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, burkholderia cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia). results:  the activity of cefepime against most gram-negative bacilli other than b cepacia  and x maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. however, cefepime is less active against these gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the activity of cefepime against b cepacia and x maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. among gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, s pyogenes, viridans streptococci and s pneumoniae. however, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant s aureus and enterococci. conclusions: due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

TI  == the role of cytokines in bacterial pneumonia: an inflammatory balancing act.
AB  == bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. while tremendous advances have been made in the treatment of pneumonia using broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens, these approaches have resulted in the recent emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria. to understand better the role of the host immune response to pulmonary bacterial  infections, several in vivo animal models have been developed using different bacterial agents: two acute infection models using klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus pneumoniae and one model of chronic infection using pseudomonas aeruginosa. to summarize, the resolution of pulmonary bacterial infections involves a finely orchestrated balancing act of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. on initial encounter with deposited bacteria, resident alveolar macrophages become activated and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the eventual generation of a proinflammatory amplification loop between resident or recruited macrophages or polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes. as the infection is cleared, a second wave of antiinflammatory cytokines is produced to localize the inflammatory response to within the lung microenvironment and eventually to downmodulate this response. experimental perturbation of the host inflammatory "cycle" can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on bacterial clearance. with this in mind, a cautionary approach needs to be used in proposing immunoadjuvant therapies for pneumonia treatment.

TI  == bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe  (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10  most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several  pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian  isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to  penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost  every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.

AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia: challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a common infection in intensive care unit patients that results in high mortality and morbidity and increased duration of hospital stay. clinical diagnostic methods are sensitive, but lack specificity. quantitative analysis of specimens from the lower respiratory tract  increases specificity. bacteria causing vap may originate from the patient's endogenous flora, other patients or hospital personnel, or from environmental sources. aspiration or direct inoculation are the major routes of bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract. the bacterial inoculum and host response in the lung are important factors for pathogenesis. late-onset nosocomial pneumonia is often caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, however, are the more common pathogens in early-onset disease. oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with bacteria, cross-infection, as well as the indiscriminate use of antibiotics or invasive devices substantially increase the risk of vap. an understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of vap, along with implementation of appropriate preventive measures, are needed to decrease the incidence, morbidity, and mortality associated with vap.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the clinical, biological, and radiologic features of presentation in the emergency ward of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) by legionella pneumophila (lp) and other community-acquired bacterial pneumonias to help in early diagnosis of cap by lp. three hundred ninety-two patients with cap were studied prospectively in the emergency department of a 600-bed university hospital. univariate and multivariate analyses were performed  to compare epidemiologic and demographic data and clinical, analytical, and radiologic features of presentation in 48 patients with cap by lp and 125 patients with cap by other bacterial etiology (68 by streptococcus pneumoniae, 41 by chlamydia pneumoniae, 5 by mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4 by coxiella burnetii, 3 by pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 by haemophilus influenzae, and 2 by nocardia species. univariate analysis showed that cap by lp was more frequent in middle-aged, male  healthy (but alcohol drinking) patients than cap by other etiology. moreover, the lack of response to previous beta-lactamic drugs, headache, diarrhea, severe hyponatremia, and elevation in serum creatine kinase (ck) levels on presentation  were more frequent in cap by lp, while cough, expectoration, and thoracic pain were more frequent in cap by other bacterial etiology. however, multivariate analysis only confirmed these differences with respect to lack of underlying disease, diarrhea, and elevation in the ck level. we conclude that detailed analysis of features of presentation of cap allows suspicion of legionnaire's disease in the emergency department. the initiation of antibiotic treatment, including a macrolide, and the performance of rapid diagnostic techniques are mandatory in these cases.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1996 to may 1997. of  the above bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were escherichia coli. susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. enterococcus faecalis ampicillin (abpc) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 1 microgram/ml. imipenem (ipm) and vancomycin (vcm) were also active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. the others had low activities with the mic90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus including mrsa arbekacin (abk) and vcm showed the highest activities against both s. aureus and mrsa isolated from patients with utis. the  mic90s of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. the others except minocycline (mino) had low activities with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis abk and vcm showed the strongest activities against s. epidermis isolated from patients with utis. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm) and cefozopran  (czop) were also active with the mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml. compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the mic90s of them had changed into  a better state. they ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. streptococcus agalactiae all drugs except mino were active against s. agalactiae. abpc, czop, ipm, and clarithromycin (cam) showed the highest activities. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. tosufloxacin (tflx) and vcm were also active with the mic90s of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. citrobacter freundii gentamicin (gm) showed the highest activity against c. freundii isolated from patients with utis. its mic90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. ipm and amikacin (amk) were also active with the mic90s of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. cefpirome (cpr) and czop were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. the mic90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. enterobacter cloacae ipm showed the highest activity against e. cloacae. the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. the mic90s of ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tflx were 1 microgram/ml, the mic90 of amk was 2 micrograms/ml, the mic90s of czop, gm and ofloxacin (oflx) were 4 micrograms/ml. the mic50s of cephems except cez, cefmetazole (cmz) and cefaclor (ccl) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. escherichia coli all drugs except penicillins and mino were active against e. coli. particularly cpr, czop and ipm showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. among e. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except cez, cefoperazone (cpz), latamoxef (lmox) and ccl have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8.  klebsiella pneumoniae k. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml or below. cpr had the strongest activity, the mics for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. flomoxef (fmox), cefixime (cfix), czop and carumonam (crmn) were also active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. pseudomonas aeruginosa all drugs except quinolones were not so active against p. aeruginosa with the mic90s were 32 micrograms/ml or above. quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. the mic90s of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the mic50s of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. serratia marcescens  gm showed the highest activity against s. marcescens. its mic90 was 1 micro

TI  == bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic patients with cancer: causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome.
AB  == background: bacteremic pneumonia is a major cause of death among neutropenic patients with cancer. methods: we analyzed the causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia identified among 408 episodes of bacteremia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer, prospectively documented from 1986 to 1995. results: the most frequent causative  organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (12 cases), escherichia coli (5 cases), and streptococcus mitis (3 cases). overall, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia, compared with 11.4% of bacteremic episodes from other sources (p< .001). thirty patients received ceftazidime and 10 patients received imipenem as  the beta-lactam component of the initial empirical treatment. all strains of p. aeruginosa were susceptible to both agents. forty-seven percent of streptococcal  strains were penicillin resistant and showed a decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1 to 64 microg/ml). five patients (12.5%) were considered to have received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. attributable mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumonia  was higher than in patients with bacteremia from other sources; 22 (55%) of the 40 patients with bacteremic pneumonia died, whereas 39 (10.6%) of the 368 patients with bacteremia from other sources died (p<.001). conclusions: our data  suggest that bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with a poor outcome and that empirical antibiotic therapy for neutropenic patients with pneumonia should include agents active against both p. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant streptococci.

TI  == [correlation between pulmonary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics support the  hypothesis of the usefulness of ceftazidime at a single 1g daily dose in the treatment of bacterial exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchopneumonia with  moderate functional damage].
AB  == introduction and background: experimental studies have shown that cephalosporins  have an antibacterial effect in vivo even when their levels are above mic for only 40-50% of dosing intervals, whereas maximum killing is obtained when concentrations are above mic for 60-70% of the time. since most patients treated  with antibiotics have neutrophils and other natural defence mechanisms, it is likely that a bacteriostatic effect should be sufficient to induce an effective therapeutic response. methods: given that in the potential sites of lung infection ceftazidime reaches significantly higher levels than the mic of the most commonplace respiratory pathogens, even 8-12 hours after the administration  of 1 g i.m., the authors evaluated the efficacy of treatment of renewed acute episodes of copd using this antibiotic at a dose of 1 g once a day. in order to do this, 20 outpatients were enrolled in the study, half of whom presented moderate bronchial obstruction (fev1 = 50-70% of theoretical) whereas the remainder presented marked bronchial obstruction (fev1 = < 50% of theoretical). results: the 10 patients with moderate obstruction at the time of enrollment, who presented haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae or moraxella catarrhalis as causal agents in the sputum (escherichia coli was only isolated in one patient), showed a marked improvement following treatment with 1 g ceftazidime one a day. a real or presumed eradication of the causal microorganism was observed in all subjects. treatment with ceftazidime at the dose of 1 g/die once a day was much less effective in patients with marked bronchial obstruction. treatment was successful in 7 out of 10 subjects, but 2 of them relapsed within 2 weeks. in this second group, pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in the sputum of 3  patients; one of the patients showed a persistence of the bacterium after ceftazidime treatment, and another presented reinfection 12 days after the end of treatment. the two patients in whom staphylococcus aureus was isolated did not benefit from ceftazidime treatment at this dosage. one subject who initially presented streptococcus pneumoniae in his sputum and was then thought to have recovered, underwent a new acute episode caused by moraxella catarrhalis 2 weeks  after the suspension of ceftazidime treatment. conclusions: the therapeutic responses observed during this study suggest the possibility of using ceftazidime in a single daily dose of 1 g i.m. to treat those patients with exacerbations of  copd who only present moderately impaired functional symptoms. on the contrary, this type of therapeutic approach must be used with extreme caution in subjects with marked functional damage, although a satisfactory clinical response may be obtained in some cases. however, the small number of patients included in this study does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. only a study involving a larger group of patients could provide the necessary information to confirm the hypothesis for treatment put forward by the authors.

TI  == regulation of chemokine gene expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils phagocytosing microbial pathogens.
AB  == production of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) by neutrophils is likely to be important in the regulation of inflammation and the control of infection. in this study we show that exposure of human neutrophils to various microbial pathogens leads to the production of both macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (mip-1alpha) and il-8. the bacterial microbes, salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus all strongly induced both il-8  and mip-1alpha secretion, whereas streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and the opportunistic yeast candida albicans were less potent. saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymosan both induced il-8 secretion but failed to stimulate that of mip-1alpha. coincubation of neutrophils with the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the micro-organisms also led to differential expression of mip-1alpha and il-8. significant enhancement of the induction of both mip-1alpha and il-8 by s. typhimurium, p. aeruginosa, and s. pneumoniae as well as by c. albicans was observed. in contrast, while il-8 production in response to s. cerevisiae and zymosan was enhanced in the presence  of tnf-alpha, no mip-1alpha was produced. these combined results indicate that while neutrophils exposed to some micro-organisms alone or in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-alpha will produce both mip-1alpha and il-8, resulting in generation of signals for the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes  and neutrophils, respectively, certain types of microorganisms can skew this response toward synthesis of il-8.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefozopran (czop) against recent clinical  isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ceftazidime (caz), cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), cefotaxime (ctx), sulbactam/cefoperazone (s/c), imipenem  (ipm), oxacillin (mpipc), and flomoxef (fmox). mic80 values of czop for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n = 41), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, n = 57), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 45), enterococus faecalis (n = 49), enterobacter cloacae (n = 50), citrobacter freundii (n = 45), serratia marcescens (n = 45), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 100) were 1, 32, 2, 16, 4, 1, 0.25, 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. czop was more active than cpr against p. aeruginosa and exhibited similar activity to cpr against other species. czop was especially active against s. marcescens with mic values lower than 1 microgram/ml against all strains tested. czop was similarly active to or more active than cfpm against all species except for c. freundii. czop was not active against mrsa. thus, we investigated the in vitro combination effects of czop/vancomycin (vcm) and czop/arbekacin (abk) using the checkerboard method. the interaction between czop and vcm ranged  from additive activity (0.5 < fic index < or = 1.00, n = 37) to synergistic activity (fic index < 0.50, n = 1), except for one strain showing indifference (1.00 < fic index < or = 2.00). the interaction between czop and abk ranged from  additive activity (n = 22) to synergistic activity (n = 1). these date suggest the potential effect of combination therapy of (czop) and vcm or abk against mrsa. the combined therapy is suggested to be useful to reduce side effects in patients with impared renal function, to reduce the administration dose of vcm or to treat infections of sites where achievable drug concentrations are lower than  those commonly achieved in the bloodstream. we also investigated the combination  effects of czop/amk and czop/gm against czop-resistant p. aeruginosa (mic > 16 micrograms/ml). the combination of czop/amk showed additive activity (n = 9) to synergistic activity (n = 2). the combination of czop/gm showed additive activity (n = 5). these results suggest that combinations of czop with amk or gm are effective in treating p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == levofloxacin and sparfloxacin: new quinolone antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to discuss the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity, clinical trials, and adverse effects of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin, two new fluoroquinolone antibiotics. data sources: literature was identified by a medline search from january 1985 to september 1997. abstracts and presentations were identified by review of program abstracts from the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy from 1988 to 1996. study selection: randomized, controlled clinical studies were selected for evaluation; however, uncontrolled studies were included when data were limited for indications approved by the food and drug administration (fda). in vitro data were selected from comparison trials whenever available. only in vitro trials that provided data on the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit 90% of isolates were used. data from north american studies were selected whenever available. data extraction: data were evaluated with respect to in vitro activity, study design, clinical and microbiologic outcomes, and adverse drug reactions. data synthesis: levofloxacin and sparfloxacin are active against pathogens frequently  involved in community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, and chlamydia pneumoniae. both compounds have enhanced activity compared with ciprofloxacin against most gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and retain good activity against most enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. sparfloxacin has greater anaerobic activity than levofloxacin, which is more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. although many clinical studies are available only in abstract form, the clinical data demonstrate that these new quinolones are effective for most community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis, and skin and skin structure infections.  fda-approved indications are limited for both compounds to date. conclusions: levofloxacin and sparfloxacin have improved gram-positive activity compared with  that of older fluoroquinolones, and are administered once daily. sparfloxacin-associated photosensitivity may limit its therapeutic usefulness. clinical trials confirm that these agents are as effective as traditional therapies for the management of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, acute gonococcal and  nongonococcal urethritis, and skin and skin structure infections.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

TI  == bacterial adherence in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == bacterial adherence is thought to be a first important step in the pathogenesis of infection. it is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner via a lock- and key mechanism with complementary receptors on the mucosal surfaces of the host. we studied adherence to buccal cells of a panel of potential respiratory pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in 18 smokers and 18 healthy non-smokers. our results show an increased pneumococcal adherence in smokers compared to that of non-smokers and this may explain the role of smoking as a risk factor in the susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. the other bacterial species tested do not differ in their adhesion values and probably require previous damage of the mucosa before adhesion 1997 the italian pharmacological society.

TI  == the role of fluoroquinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == quinolones, because of their excellent pharmacokinetic properties, high antimicrobial activity and low incidence of side-effects, have been broadly accepted for the treatment of many infections. because of perceived limitations against streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  there has been some reluctance to use them for respiratory tract infections. ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for malignant external otitis, a disease caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it has also been used successfully for the  treatment of chronic otitis media where p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and proteus mirabilis are main pathogens. quinolones are as efficacious as the beta-lactams and cephalosporins in the treatment of acute sinusitis but most clinicians will not use quinolones for this indication. acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic  bronchitis respond to antimicrobial therapy and quinolones have been demonstrated to be at least equivalent to second- and third-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and beta-lactams. recently published guidelines in canada, usa and great britain do not recommend quinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia except for patients with life-threatening disease requiring icu admission. a quinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside and macrolide is a regimen that can be used as initial empirical therapy until the results of microbiological investigations are available. for patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, where multiply resistant aerobic gram-negative bacilli are a consideration, a quinolone in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin has been recommended. in the absence of p. aeruginosa, monotherapy with a quinolone is at least as effective as third-generation cephalosporins or imipenem. early switch therapy from parenteral antibiotics to oral fluoroquinolone has been demonstrated to be very successful.

TI  == the infectious complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  == infectious complications continue to have a major impact on the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite advances in therapeutic approaches to this disease and supportive care. although the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, systemic hypogammaglobulinemia is  the major immune defect accounting for the increased risk of infection. despite common knowledge of systemic immune defects in this population, information regarding mucosal immune function is minimal. in patients treated with conventional alkylating agents, infections commonly occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequent isolates. the use of purine analogues as fludarabine has resulted in a change in this spectrum of infection,  with the appearance of opportunistic infections caused by pneumocystis, listeria, mycobacterium tuberculosis, nocardia, candida, aspergillus, and herpesviruses. further knowledge of the impact of chemotherapy on immune function, and of the immune defects in these patients, both inherent to the primary disease process and therapy-related, will aid in the formulation of better prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of infection and improve the ultimate outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661, a new 1beta-methylcarbapenem, were compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, biapenem, cefpirome, and ceftazidime. the activity of s-4661 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci was comparable to that of  imipenem, with an mic at which 90% of the strains tested were inhibited (mic90) equal to 0.5 microg/ml or less. s-4661 was highly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis, with mic90s ranging from 0.032 to 0.5 microg/ml. against imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, s-4661 was the most active among test agents (mic90, 8 microg/ml). furthermore, s-4661 displayed a high degree of activity against many  ceftazidime-, ciprofloxacin-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates of p. aeruginosa. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 against experimentally induced infections in mice  caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and drug-resistant p. aeruginosa, reflected its potent in vitro activity and high levels in plasma in mice. we conclude that s-4661 is a promising new carbapenem for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and drug-resistant p. aeruginosa.

TI  == bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular  components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay.  the samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pyogenes. as control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to mueller-hinton broth. in order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr.  similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in mueller hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. it seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.

TI  == effects of exogenous cytokines on intravascular clearance of bacteria in normal and splenectomized mice.
AB  == background: pretreatment with interleukin-1 (il-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating  factor (gm-csf) can improve alveolar macrophage bactericidal activity against pneumococci. these effects vary in eusplenic and asplenic mice. likewise, these cytokines have been shown to improve survival after an aerosol pneumococcal challenge. mice dying in these studies had positive blood cultures and disseminated infection. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of  cytokine pretreatment on intravascular clearance of bacteria from eusplenic and asplenic mice. methods: two weeks after splenectomy or sham operation, mice were  pretreated for various times with il-1, g-csf, or gm-csf or their corresponding vehicles. mice then received tail-vein injections of bacteria (0.1 ml), and quantitative blood cultures were performed 15 and 30 minutes thereafter. results: splenectomized mice had impaired clearance of both pneumococci and pseudomonas compared with sham-operated mice (p < 0.05). il-1 enhanced clearance in splenectomized mice (p < 0.001) but not in sham-operated mice (p not significant). g-csf enhanced bacterial clearance in sham-operated mice (p < 0.01) but not in splenectomized mice (p not significant). gm-csf enhanced clearance in  both groups (p < 0.001). conclusion: the net effects of exogenous cytokine therapy for infections depends on the state of the host defenses at the time of therapy. these agents may be useful as adjuvants for the treatment of infections, but further study is warranted.

AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

TI  == [the role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  == carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, enterococcus faecium  and streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them  such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia. imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem  requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme  inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. in abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (wsbl), cases of meningitis by pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. the carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. in the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care  units. the appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli,  producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class i chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == humoral immune response within the lung in hiv-1 infection.
AB  == in order to study the humoral immune defences in the respiratory tract during hiv-1 infection, we measured the levels, local productions and anti-hiv and antibacterial activities of igg and iga in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) and serum of 61 adult patients with severe hiv infection and of 56 hiv- controls. albumin was used as the serum transudation factor. the increase of immunoglobulin levels in the serum of hiv-infected patients was confirmed. the igg level was also increased in epithelial lining fluid (elf), whereas the total  iga level was unchanged and secretory iga (siga) level was decreased. the elf/serum immunoglobulin ratios suggested that the igg present in elf resulted mainly from transudation, in contrast to siga, which was synthesized locally in controls but greatly diminished in hiv-infected patients. igg to hiv-1 could be detected in balf of all the patients, but iga to hiv-1 only in 30% of patients. bal igg reacted more consistently and with a broader array of hiv-1 antigens than did iga. bal iga, when present in samples, reacted primarily with viral envelope  antigens. because iga specificities to some hiv-1 antigens were detected more intensively by bal than by serum immunoglobulins, we conclude that the mucosal immune response is distinct from that in serum. igg antibody activity to streptococcus pneumoniae was decreased in hiv-infected patients' sera, and iga antibody activities to s. pneumoniae and to pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased in elf in hiv-infected patients.

AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (cam), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cam and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. the results are summarized as follows; 1. it was not showed that cam-resistant strains were increasing among staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma pneumoniae. it appeared that resistances to cam and macrolides (mls) were increasing among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the drug susceptibility patterns to mls were similar and detection frequencies of induced  resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring mls including cam  and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring mls were high among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. it appears that mls-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing mls-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, cam is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, b. pertussis, c. jejuni subsp. jejuni, c. trachomatis and m. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == risk factor of complications requiring neurosurgical intervention in infants with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == among 50 consecutive cases of bacterial meningitis in infants aged 6 months or less, 9 (group i) were confirmed to have complications requiring neurosurgery during the first 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment. neurosurgery was performed in 40, 33, and 30% of cases caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli, respectively. there were 5 cases of subdural empyema, 1 case of brain abscess, 1 case of subdural empyema and brain abscess, and 2 cases of ventriculitis with severe hydrocephalus. all complications requiring neurosurgery were initially detected by cranial ultrasonography. the other 41 patients who did not undergo neurosurgery were classified as group ii. comparison of clinical presentations and laboratory findings between the two groups showed that group 1 contained more patients with a history of inadequate treatment, and longer duration of illness before diagnosis. except for prolonged  disturbance of consciousness, there was no difference between the two groups in clinical and laboratory data on admission or in clinical course during therapy. due to the high incidence of complications requiring neurosurgical treatment, cost-effective cranial ultrasound is recommended for screening every young infant with bacterial meningitis, especially in cases caused by s. pneumoniae.

AB  == trovafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity. trovafloxacin has similar or 2-fold lower activity than ciprofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, trovafloxacin has similar activity to ciprofloxacin. other susceptible gram-negative pathogens include neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasmas. the drug is active against gram-positive bacteria and consistently displayed greater activity (2- to 8-fold) than ciprofloxacin against all staphylococci and streptococci tested; activity included methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. trovafloxacin has some activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci. anaerobes such as bacteroides and clostridium spp. are also susceptible to trovafloxacin. preliminary clinical data suggest that trovafloxacin is effective in the treatment of patients with upper and lower respiratory tract and uncomplicated urinary tract infections and infections caused by c. trachomatis or n. gonorrhoeae. the most frequently noted adverse event with trovafloxacin is dizziness which is reported in 11% of patients versus 3% of those receiving comparator agents. other commonly reported events (> 1% of  patients) are nausea, headache, vomiting, vaginitis and diarrhoea.

AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

(mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus ssp. (mic90s,  0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). potent ru-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). ru-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against enterococcus faecalis (mics 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against enterococcus faecium (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not  inhibited by ru-59863 (mic90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). among the cephalosporins tested, ru-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. ru-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. ru-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against gram-negative pathogens  resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem dz-2640.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == [diagnostic imaging and therapeutic implications in lung infections in patients with hiv-1 infection].
AB  == we studied retrospectively 132 episodes of infectious pneumonias in 89 patients examined from 1990 to 1995. pneumocystis carinii was found to be the most common  cause of pneumonia (33 patients). the other causes were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15), mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), staphylococcus aureus (5), cytomegalovirus (4), haemophilus influentiae (4), mycobacterium avium intracellulare (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), e. coli (2), serratia marcescens (1). no etiologic agent was found in 40 cases. we stress the need of a more frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures in the study of focal lung consolidations because this radiologic sign is highly aspecific and may be caused by too many different pathogenic agents, needing different therapies-i.e., streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), staphylococcus aureus (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), escherichia coli (2), pneumocystis carinii, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influentiae (1). since there is an increase in mortality among patients treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, we  stress the need of the routinary use of bronchoalveolar lavage in hiv+ patients with lung consolidation to perform specific therapy. moreover, pneumocystis carinii is by far the most frequent cause of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and pcp has very suggestive clinical (dyspnea), radiologic (diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates; ground glass opacities; pneumatoceles) and laboratory (cd3+cd4 < 200/mcl; ldh > 600 ui/dl; po2 < 70 mmhg) patterns, always related to the discovery of pneumocystis carinii in escreatum. thus, we decided to treat 15  patients with specific therapy for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with the above  diagnostic algorithm, obtaining in all of them complete clinical and radiologic recovery. to conclude, in critical patients, invasive procedures should be performed only in the cases in which pcp is clinically improbable.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
AB  == the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 567 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1995 to september 1996. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) showed the most highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of  0.5 micrograms/ml. vancomycin (vcm) showed the next highest activity with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. these drugs showed the high activities against mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae. most of drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefpirome (cpr) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.25 microgram/ml. erythromycin (em) and clindamycin (cldm) showed low activities with mic80s 128 micrograms/ml or high. among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae test with all mics at 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cmx, cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activity with mic90s to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed  the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1  microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs) and carumonam (crmn) showed next potent activity, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80 of ampicillin (abpc) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) k. pneumoniae. all drugs except abpc were active against k. pneumoniae. cpr and crmn showed the most potent activities against k.  pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m. (b.) catarrhalis. against m. (b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with mic80s at  4 micrograms/ml or below. and mics of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below.  ipm, oflx and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. the examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportion of differe

TI  == bacterial colonization of distal airways in healthy subjects and chronic lung disease: a bronchoscopic study.
AB  == in contrast to the healthy population, distal airway bacterial colonization may occur in patients with chronic lung diseases, who often have altered pulmonary defences. however, the information dealing with this issue is insufficient and is based mainly on nonspecific samples, such as sputum cultures. using quantitative  cultures of bronchoscopic protected specimen brush (psb) and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) samples, we studied the bacterial colonization of distal airways in  16 healthy subjects, 33 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, 18 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), 17 with bronchiectasis, and 32 with a long-term tracheostomy due to laryngeal carcinoma. all patients were without exacerbation, and free from antibiotic treatment at least 1 month before the study protocol. thresholds for quantitative cultures to define colonization were  > or = 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) x ml(-1) for psb and > or = 10(3) cfu x ml(-1) for bal. only one healthy subject was colonized by a potential pathogenic  microorganism (ppm) (staphylococcus aureus 4x10(2) cfu x ml(-1) in a psb culture). colonization was observed in 14 (42%) bronchogenic carcinoma patients (19 non-ppms, and 10 ppms); in 15 (83%) copd patients (22 non-ppms and 7 ppms); in 15 (88%) bronchiectasis patients (20 non-ppms and 13 ppms); and in 15 (47%) long-term tracheostomy patients (5 non-ppms and 13 ppms). the two most frequent non-ppms isolated in all groups studied were streptococcus viridans and neisseria spp. haemophilus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis were the most frequent ppms isolated in bronchogenic carcinoma, copd, bronchiectasis and long-term tracheostomized patients, respectively. pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was infrequent in all the groups. our results show that distal airway bacterial colonization is a frequent  feature in stable patients with chronic lung diseases and also in patients with long-term tracheostomy. however, the pattern of colonization differs among groups studied. the knowledge of different colonization patterns may be important for future antibiotic prophylactic strategies and for the empirical antibiotic regimens when exacerbations occur in these patients.

TI  == [polymicrobial endocarditis: a clinical and evolutive study of 12 cases diagnosed during a 10-year period].
AB  == polymicrobial endocarditis (pe) is uncommon, whether in series of cases of polymicrobial bacteriemia or of endocarditis. among the 201 cases of infective endocarditis seen between 1986 and 1995 by an infectious diseases service, 12 patients had pe (6%). nine were males, mean age was 28 years and ten were active  intravenous drug users. all of them were hiv (+) and 50% had aids. eleven subjects had infection of the tricuspid valve and 58% developed septic pulmonary  emboli. the most common organism encountered was staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients followed by streptococcus viridans and s. pneumoniae in three. the most  common combinations of organisms were s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in 3 cases and  s. aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in two. two patients died, one with xantomona maltophilia and another with candida albicans. the symptoms of pe were  usually indistinguishable from endocarditis caused by a single organism and the prognosis depended on the species rather than the number of organisms isolated.

TI  == the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501  (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance: implications for managing respiratory failure.
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens is increasing rapidly. in the community, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has escalated dramatically among moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. resistance to penicillin among s. pneumoniae has developed at an alarming rate over the past two decades. recent studies in the united states have cited rates of penicillin resistance as high as 23.6%, with 9.5% exhibiting high-level resistance. many of these strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. antimicrobial resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens is  a problem, which in large part reflects patterns of antibiotic use. antimicrobial resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli have become increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are seen with  increasing frequency in enterobacteriaceae, primarily klebsiella spp. fluoroquinolone resistance has increased in p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and has now been identified in escherichia coli isolated from hematology wards. excessive use of antibiotics may promote the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. rigorous infection control measures and modification of antibiotic use patterns may limit or reduce the prevalence of resistant organisms.

TI  == a compilation of studies assessing the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparators in 84 laboratories throughout europe.
AB  == objective: to compile the results of investigations conducted in 84 centers throughout europe of the in vitro activity of meropenem and a standard set of comparators against some 12 000 gram-positive, gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. methods: recent clinical isolates from 84 european countries  were tested using mueller---hinton broth or agar (aerobes and nutritionally fastidious species) or wilkins---chalgren medium (anaerobes) for susceptibility to meropenem, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin and  gentamicin (aerobes) or meropenem, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole (anaerobes). results: whether compared across studies or across countries, meropenem and imipenem were the only compounds that produced uniform and predictable activity. the activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was compromized  because of instability to both chromosomally mediated and new plasmid-mediated (transferable) beta-lactamases. this effect was even more pronounced with piperacillin. resistance to gentamicin was commonplace, although variable between countries; strains resistant to ciprofloxacin occurred in many genera of enterobacteriaceae and amongst the pseudomonads. metronidazole was uniformly active against anaerobes but there were many clindamycin-resistant strains. resistance, or diminished susceptibility, amongst streptococcus pneumoniae was found frequently, but of the beta-lactams tested, only ceftazidime and piperacillin produced minimum inhibitory concentration values that could compromize therapeutic efficacy outside the central nervous system. conclusions:  these data provide further evidence of the high incidence of antibiotic resistance in europe, notably in france, spain and italy. fortunately, the carbapenems are highly stable to the enzymes that hydrolyze cephalosporins and penicillins. hence, they retain an essentially unaltered and exceptional antimicrobial spectrum, embracing the vast majority of strains resistant to the other comparators, although meropenem was more reliable than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == postantibiotic effect of ceftriaxone and gentamicin alone and in combination on klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus viridans.
AB  == a persistent suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to an antimicrobial agent, the postantibiotic effect (pae), has been described for a variety of antibiotics and microorganisms. in this study the pae of ceftriaxone and gentamicin was determined in vitro on three strains each of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus viridans. the strains were exposed to the substances for 2 h at varying concentrations. ceftriaxone was used at the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and 1/2 mic and gentamicin at 1/2 mic, 1/4 mic, and 1/8 mic, each alone and in combination. antibiotic concentrations were reduced by 1,000-fold dilution, bacterial regrowth was consequently monitored by viable count. the pae of ceftriaxone alone reached up to 145 min (mic) and 50 min (1/2 mic), that of gentamicin alone up to 170 min (1/2 mic), 135 min (1/4 mic) and 70 min (1/8 mic), depending on the bacterial species. combinations of the antibiotics produced longer paes than one substance  alone; the longest pae was produced by the combination of ceftriaxone (mic) and gentamicin (1/2 mic) lasting up to 320 min (s. viridans). it may be important to  take the pae into account when evaluating dosing intervals.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == vitamin a deficiency and retinoid repletion regulate the antibody response to bacterial antigens and the maintenance of natural killer cells.
AB  == vitamin a (va) deficiency still exists in parts of the developing world where it  is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in preschool-aged children.  in the present studies, the young rat has been used as a model to investigate the effects of va deficiency and retinoid repletion on antibody responses to a variety of bacterial antigens. in va-deficient rats, antibody responses following immunization with capsular polysaccharides or protein antigens were very low, whereas responses to lipopolysaccharides were normal. in all cases of low antibody response, retinol treatment before immunization restored antibody production to control levels. the numbers of b and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in va-deficient rats were only modestly reduced, but both natural killer (nk) cell number and nk cell-mediated cytotoxicity were decreased substantially. even in va deficiency, antibody responses and nk cell cytotoxicity could be markedly stimulated by certain biological response modifiers.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) were evaluated in 42  patients with respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia (29 patients) and lower respiratory tract infections (5 patients). overall clinical efficacy rates  (excellent + good) were 79% in pneumonia and 80% in respiratory tract infections  in 34 patients evaluated for clinical efficacy. it was excellent that the clinical efficacy rate was 92% in mild and moderate pneumonia. pathogens isolated from sputa were 31 strains, including 8 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 of staphylococcus aureus and 3 of haemophilus influenzae. since the isolates were eradicated in 18 strains, replaced in 3, unchanged in 2 and unknown in 8, the overall eradication rate was 91%. the eradication rates were 89% in beta-lactamase producing strains and 100% in beta-lactamase positive sputum, and excellent or good in 19 (83%) of 23 patients  with beta-lactamase negative sputum. the eradication rate was 88% in 5 patients with beta-lactamase positive sputum. one patient experienced a moderate rash. abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 10 patients (26.3%), but these abnormalities were mild and transient. these results suggested that sbt/cpz was effective and safe for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by beta-lactamase producing as well as beta-lactamase non-producing bacteria.

TI  == microbiology and management of sinusitis.
AB  == purpose: the pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis are reviewed. materials and methods: the current literature is reviewed. review: sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. bacterial pathogens contribute to the inflammatory process-streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis are predominant in acute sinusitis, while anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in the immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters. many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. aureus, fusobacterium sp., and prevotella sp.) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (s. pneumoniae). the pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to  cause infections, and indirectly through the production of beta-lactamase. conclusions: the indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by "shielding" penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. the direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections. proper therapy, with antimicrobial and decongestants combined when indicated with surgical drainage and correction of pathology, constitutes the cornerstone of management of sinusitis.

AB  == purpose: the addition of antibiotics to infusion solutions for cataract surgery is becoming increasingly popular. the authors developed an in vitro model to evaluate antibacterial effects of this use of antibiotics. methods: clinical isolates and/or reference strains of the following organisms were examined: coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus spp, enterococcus spp, proprionibacterium acnes, moraxella nonliquifaciens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.  standardized suspensions of each organism were incubated with a control solution  (balanced salt solution) or balanced salt solution containing the following antibiotics: vancomycin (20 micrograms/ml) or gentamicin (8 micrograms/ml) or gentamicin and vancomycin combined (8 and 20 micrograms/ml, respectively). suspensions were incubated for 30, 60, and 120 minutes at room temperature. samples were centrifuged, and the organisms were washed with balanced salt solution before quantitative culturing. each organism also was incubated for 48 hours in mueller-hinton broth with the same antibiotic concentrations. results: most of the organisms were not affected by exposure to the antibiotics for up to  140 minutes. p. aeruginosa and m. nonliquifaciens were exceptions, decreasing in  colony numbers even with 30 minutes of exposure. several staphylococcus spp yielded variable results. all organisms demonstrated nearly complete inhibition of growth when exposed for an extended time to the appropriate antibiotic in broth. conclusions: exposure to antibiotics for a short period of time, such as during intraocular surgery, generally has no effect on organisms commonly responsible for endophthalmitis. the use of antibiotics in this manner should be  critically reassessed until further study.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  == it has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an n-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. in an attempt to find such a precursor, a cdna clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cdna library from porcine bone marrow. in order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we  have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the c-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. we found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of vrrfpwwwpflrr had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. it showed potency against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus group d as well  as aspergillus fumigatus. the action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than  bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mm mgcl2. our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cdna indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.

TI  == clinical applications of a new parenteral antibiotic in the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  == cephalosporins are one of the mainstays of antibiotic therapy, and third-generation cephalosporins are first-line agents for the treatment of many types of serious infections, including those of nosocomial origin. gaps in activity of currently available third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, and increasing reports of gram-negative bacilli resistance to some of these agents, especially klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp., make it necessary to investigate new compounds. cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a wide range of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multi-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, was evaluated in comparison with ceftazidime for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. ceftazidime is a commonly prescribed third-generation cephalosporin used for empiric treatment of serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and skin-structure infection. this investigation was an open, randomized comparative study involving 882 patients in north america. cefepime 2 g every 12 hours demonstrated similar efficacy to that  of ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection (including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), and skin and skin-structure infections. the bacteriologic responses were generally >85%. the most common pathogens isolated were escherichia coll, streptococcus pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and  streptococcus, group b. overall, approximately 94% of pathogens isolated in pretreatment cultures were susceptible to cefepime and ceftazidime. cefepime and  ceftazidime were well tolerated; only 3% of patients in each group discontinued therapy because of an adverse event. the most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash. the results of this study indicate that cefepime is a promising, effective, and safe single-agent therapy for serious infections in hospitalized patients.

AB  == in a surveillance study conducted during 1992-1993 at 83 medical institutions of  different types and sizes (e.g., laboratories, community hospitals, teaching hospitals) and from different geographical areas of the united states, clinical bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to eight comparative antimicrobial agents (cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and piperacillin). a total of 12,574 isolates were tested by either the etest method (ab biodisk) or a microdilution method (microscan) in the participating laboratories; 11.8% of these isolates were subsequently retested for quality assurance purposes by both methods in a central laboratory. the results obtained in the central laboratory were essentially the same as the results obtained in the participating laboratories. this article presents data for gram-negative and gram-positive isolates other than streptococcus pneumoniae, the results of which have been previously published. antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the two different minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods--microscan and etest--showed that  most isolates of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefepime, exceeding the activity of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime, principally because of the  greater activity of cefepime against the species that produce bush group 1 beta-lactamases (predominantly enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and  citrobacter freundii). in addition, the activity of cefepime against pseudomonas  aeruginosa isolates was essentially equivalent to that of ceftazidime and greater than that of third-generation cephalosporins. most methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to all the cephalosporins, whereas methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were resistant. overall, the most active antimicrobials in this study were imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime, but the activity of all the antimicrobials varied with different species. categorically, the results from the microdilution and etest methods were equivalent.

TI  == severe pulmonary infections in aids patients.
AB  == pulmonary infections are a very common complication in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) patients. these infections may be severe enough to initiate the admission of these patients to intensive care units (icu). pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (pcp) is the most frequent cause of icu admission because of acute respiratory failure. mortality of icu-admitted patients with this infection has changed with time. initial reports confirmed a high mortality (80% to 90%). after 1985, the mortality rate decreased (50%). factors such as the use of corticosteroids, better patient care, and a better knowledge of the disease probably explain this change. in recent years (1990 to 1995), mortality has worsened again, perhaps, because icu facilities were offered more liberally to patients failing aggressive conventional treatment, including adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids. however, for those patients able to be discharged, the prognosis is not worse than expected according to the stage of their human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) infection and immunologic status. consequently,  at least a limited period of icu care and some respiratory support (either continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation) should be considered and offered to all hiv-1-infected patients with pcp and respiratory failure. cytomegalovirus may be another cause of severe pulmonary infection in aids patients. this infection is difficult to diagnose; hence, it should be suspected when patients with pcp do not progress appropriately, or when no responsible pulmonary pathogen is found. when associated with pcp, mortality is very high. disseminated tuberculosis is another potential cause of severe respiratory failure and respiratory secretions should be routinely examined for acid-fast bacilli in aids patients with pulmonary infiltrates. finally, bacterial pneumonia (streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) may also be the etiological agents of severe acute respiratory failure. empiric antibacterial treatment to cover these microorganisms should be given when a bacterial agent is suspected.

AB  == it is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. this study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with  acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection  from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. our study revealed the following: (a) suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. of these 20  bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. this staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. this finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing snhl by therapeutic intervention. spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing  loss in addition to the cochlea. this subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) it has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent snhl is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible snhl is caused by serous labyrinthitis. our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) the data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) there were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with  the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. a notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the  rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
AB  == bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 492 strains of presumably  etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from october 1994 to september 1995. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of  haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. vancomycin showed the highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. s. pneumoniae. most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with mic80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with mic80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested. cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the mics of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most  potent activity against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to the activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity against k. pneumoniae with mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their mic80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their mics were all higher than >  or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. m. (b.) catarrhalis. imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, their mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their mic80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. the in vitro activity of cs-940 against gram-positive bacteria  was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. in particular, cs-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the mic at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cs-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. the activity of cs-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum  size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. cs-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa, cs-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains  tested. against experimental pneumonia with k. pneumoniae in mice, cs-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. these results suggest that cs-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.

TI  == surfactant protein a stimulates phagocytosis of specific pulmonary pathogens by alveolar macrophages.
AB  == surfactant protein a (sp-a) regulates alveolar macrophage function and has been implicated in the mediation of pulmonary host defense. our goals were to characterize the interaction of sp-a with various pulmonary pathogens, to investigate the mechanism of sp-a-mediated phagocytosis using an assay that distinguishes bound from internalized bacteria by quenching the fluorescence of extracellular bacteria, and to examine further the interactions of sp-a and the structurally homologous protein complement component 1q (c1q) with alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. we found that sp-a binds to and increases the phagocytosis of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group a streptococcus; sp-a aggregates only h. influenzae. sp-a neither binds to, aggregates, nor stimulates the phagocytosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa. we have also found that bronchoalveolar lavage stimulates phagocytosis and that this stimulation is reduced by an anti-sp-a antibody. while the enhancement of phagocytosis by sp-a is inhibited in blood monocytes adhered to c1q-coated surfaces, which presumably clusters the c1q receptor on the basal surface of the  cell, alveolar macrophages on c1q-coated slides show no significant change in their response to sp-a. in summary, sp-a stimulates the phagocytosis by alveolar  macrophages of specific pulmonary pathogens to which it binds, but aggregation is not required for the effect. additionally, the role of the c1q receptor in the response to sp-a may differ between monocytes and alveolar macrophages.

AB  == objective: to determine the combined in-vitro effects of azithromycin plus the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin or lomefloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: fractional inhibitory (fic) and fractional bactericidal concentration indices of azithromycin and the fluoroquinolone were determined using a microtiter-checkerboard method. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, xanthomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter calcoaceticus were studied. fourteen strains of s. aureus were also studied in time-kill curves with azithromycin (4 mg/l), lomefloxacin (6 mg/l) and the two in combination. results: no synergism or antagonism was found in inhibitory assays. however, bactericidal  assays revealed antagonism with some strains of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, x. maltophilia, a. calcoaceticus, p. aeruginosa, p. cepacia, k. pneumoniae and e. coli. kill-curve results with 14 strains of s. aureus showed no antagonism with four strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and antagonism with one strain of mrsa and seven methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa). conclusions: in-vitro exposure to combinations of azithromycin and a fluoroquinolone does not  produce a synergistic effect. antagonism was found in bactericidal assays against some gram-negative bacteria and mssa; caution is therefore recommended in the use of macrolides and quinolones against these organisms.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated adult patients: epidemiology and  prevention in 1996.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients have a higher incidence of pneumonia and mortality than do nonventilated patients. ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is diagnosed clinically, by bronchoscopy or "blind" bronchoalveolar lavage (bal)  or protected specimen brush (psb), and by quantitative endobronchial aspirates (qea). vap is usually caused by bacteria, but legionella pneumophila, mycobacterium tuberculosis, viruses, and fungi are also potential pathogens. bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia may be part of the patient's endogenous flora, originate from other patients, hospital personnel, or environmental sources. pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp, and staphylococcus aureus are the most common causative agents in late-onset nosocomial pneumonia, and streptococcus pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae are more commonly found in early-onset pneumonia. aspiration appears to be the major route for the entry of  bacteria into the lower respiratory tract. host factors, oropharyngeal and gastric colonization, cross-infection, and complications from the use of antibiotics and nasogastric and endotracheal tubes increases the risk of bacterial vap. a working knowledge of the epidemiology and strategies for prevention of vap should reduce infection rates, morbidity, and mortality in critically ill patients.

TI  == microbial causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == aspiration of microorganisms colonizing the oropharynx is the main route of bacterial entry to lower airways in mechanically ventilated patients. examination of the microbial flora involved in ventilator-associated pneumonia shows that only few species, among the many oropharynx microorganisms, are responsible for the majority of lower respiratory tract colonizations and infections in intubated patients. underlying disease, length of intubation, and type and duration of prior antibiotic therapy are the most important factors related with the causative flora of respiratory infections in these patients. except in certain populations (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [copd] patients who may be colonized by pseudomonas aeruginosa), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and unencapsulated hemophilus influenzae are the predominant respiratory pathogens within the first week of intubation in critically ill patients. these microorganisms are subsequently replaced by multiresistant flora, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococci or acinetobacter baumanii. this change of flora takes place as a consequence of prior antibiotic therapy among other factors. fungi have to be taken in account particularly in the presence of severe immunodepression. all of  these multiresistant pathogens (particularly p aeruginosa) are responsible for most of the deaths directly related to pneumonia; therefore, the early recognition of causative agents and appropriate antibiotic therapy are of great importance determining outcome. this strategy represents the most efficient approach to managing patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.

AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

AB  == between july 1992 and june 1993, 61 patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia were admitted to our semi-intensive care unit. for all patients chest x-ray, blood gas analysis while breathing room air, gram stain and culture of bronchoaspirate, determination of acute and convalescent anti-body titers for legionella pneumophila, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae, blood culture when body temperature was greater than 38 degrees c, and pharyngeal swab  for c. pneumoniae detection by means of an indirect immunofluorescence test were  obtained. among the patients enrolled, 15 suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 18 had serious chronic diseases, 9 were immunodeficient and 15 had cardiovascular diseases, and only 4 had no underlying disease. etiologic diagnosis was reached in 30 cases (49%). as expected, due to the high rate of seriously ill patients, gram-negative pathogens were identified most commonly (15%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) and, surprisingly, by c. pneumoniae (10%). these data, showing the possible emergence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and c. pneumoniae, warrant further studies in order to verify whether  the epidemiological pattern of severe community-acquired pneumonia is actually changing.

TI  == a modified pcr-based method for rapid non-radioactive detection of clinically important pathogens.
AB  == we have devised a sensitive and rapid method for the detection of several bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens using pcr. this method has been named direct labeling and detection procedure (dldp) and is based on the direct incorporation of a nonradioactive digoxigenin label (dig-11-dutp) into a microbial species-specific gene fragment during amplification. following amplification, the resulting pcr products are cleansed of nonincorporated dig-11-dutp, spotted onto a nylon membrane, fixed by uv-crosslinking and the labeled dna is visualized by digoxigenin detection reagents. using cultivated reference bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa) we were able to demonstrate a rapid and sensitive detection of < 20 cfu of bacteria in human secretions (sputum, urine, mucous). the present study suggests that dldp can be used as a reliable method for indication of bacteria in clinical or environmental specimens with the proviso that the selected corresponding oligonucleotide primers provide amplification of strong species-specific genes.

TI  == recent trends in clinical isolates from paranasal sinusitis.
AB  == trends in the detection of causative pathogens and changes in bacterial counts in patients with sinusitis treated between january 1989 and december 1993 were investigated. in adult patients with chronic sinusitis, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns), streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), corynebacterium sp., haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae), and moraxella catarrhalis were often isolated while pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and anaerobic bacteria were detected in 2.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively. the bacteria isolated from adult patients with acute sinusitis and  pediatric patients with either acute or chronic sinusitis were somewhat different from those of adult chronic sinusitis. no bacteria could be isolated from 5.8% of adult chronic sinusitis patients, 8.1% of adult acute sinusitis patients, and 3.1% of pediatric sinusitis patients. the detection rate for anaerobic bacteria has been rising in chronic sinusitis patients owing to improved detection techniques in recent years, while there has been no appreciable change in the isolation rate for other types of bacteria. when the pathogenicity of isolated bacteria was determined based on the amount of bacterial colonization it was found that p. aeruginosa, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, and s. aureus were significant as causative pathogens in sinusitis, while cns.

TI  == comparative evaluation of blood culture using the vital automated system and the  becton-dickinson septi-chek bhi-s biphasic and sch bottles.
AB  == a comparative study was performed using 1,168 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture pairs from 395 patients, during which 5-10 ml of blood were collected in both septi-chek bhi-s biphasic and septi-chek sch bottles (becton-dickinson, meylan, france) and vital aer and vital ana bottles (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france). the bottles were analyzed by using a 7-day protocol for vital and a 12-day protocol for septi-chek. the vital bottles revealed negative were all subcultured at the end of the protocol. of the 374 positive septi-chek bottles, only 202 bottles gave a positive subculture. of the 245 positive vital bottles, 223 bottles led to the isolation of a microorganism. thirty-five septic episodes were detected by septi-chek compared to 38 by the vital system (only clinically significant isolates were taken into consideration). four septic episodes were detected by vital only (one episode implicating coagulase-negative staphylococcus, one streptococcus pneumoniae, one pseudomonas aeruginosa and one  candida albicans, involving a total of 15 bottles). one septic episode implicating bacteroides fragilis was detected by septi-chek only (five bottles).  among the negative vital bottles, only six bottles gave a positive terminal subculture. this study validates the reliability of the vital system to detect positive blood cultures.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1992)].
AB  == bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan since 1981, and ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates  and characteristics of the patients and so forth each year. we discuss the results in detail. in 20 institutions around the entire japan from october 1992 to september 1993, 690 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 549 patients with lower respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological bacteria. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 101 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 121 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 32 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 28 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. s. aureus s. aureus strains for which mics of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 61.4% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was higher than the previous year's 58.3%. mics values indicated that arbekacin was as active as vancomycin against all the strains on s. aureus. 2. s. pneumoniae benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent  activities against s. pneumoniae. cefuzonam, cefazolin, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and mic80  was 0.015 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae all the drugs tested were potent against h. influenzae. ampicillin among the penicillins showed mic80 1 microgram/ml against h. influenzae. cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime showed the most potent activities, and mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. the antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid) ciprofloxacin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), and mic80 was 1 microgram/ml. cefsulodin, aztreonam, carumonam and tobramycin showed the next most potent activities with an mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed  the highest activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with an mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. norfloxacin also showed some activity, and mic80 was 4 micrograms/ml. comparing to activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. k. pneumoniae the activities of all drugs except penicillins were high activities against k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity with an mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed by flomoxef, cefixime and cefozopran with their mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. 7. m.(b.) catarrhalis imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity against m.(b.) catarrhalis with an mic80 0.063 microgram/ml. minocycline and ofloxacin showed mic80s 0.125 microgram/ml, respectively. we also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological bacteria. as for patients backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found among patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 60.8% of the diseases. the distribution by lower respiratory tract  infections was as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 30.4%, 29.5%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 12.2%. as for frequencies of etiologic bacteria for respiratory tract infections, h. influenzae: 22.2%, and s. pneumoniae: 15.1% in chronic bronchitis; s. pneumoniae: 2

TI  == lung abscess in patients with aids.
AB  == we identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection and lung abscess. all patients had advanced hiv disease, and the mean cd4 cell count  was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). the microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). the pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), p. carinii (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (5), staphylococcus aureus (4), aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), haemophilus influenzae (1), streptococcus milleri (1), proteus mirabilis (1), and cryptococcus neoformans (1). mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. the outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. in patients with aids, lung abscess is associated  with advanced hiv infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis after radial keratotomy.
AB  == purpose: to report the findings concerning three patients with endophthalmitis and one with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis radial keratotomy surgery. methods: one man referred with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis and three women referred with endophthalmitis were treated. results: after radial keratotomy surgery, during which no microperforation or macroperforation had been reported, a severe pseudomonas panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis developed in the man. all vision was lost in that eye. staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis developed in one woman, streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis  in the second woman and pseudomonas endophthalmitis in the third woman, after undergoing radial keratotomy procedures during which microperforations occurred.  in the latter patient, bilateral simultaneous surgery was performed, but only one eye became infected. the latter two infections resulted in light perception and hand motion vision respectively. in three cases, an initial keratitis was located in the inferior cornea. conclusions: severe bacterial endophthalmitis can occur after radial keratotomy surgery, even in the absence of microperforation during the procedure. any evidence of postoperative keratitis must be regarded seriously and treated aggressively. despite use of this approach, the effect on final visual acuity can be devastating.

TI  == quality assessment of microbe base antimicrobial susceptibility data.
AB  == aims: to assess the quality of centres contributing antimicrobial susceptibility  data to a centralised database. methods: twelve organisms were distributed to 31  regional microbiology laboratories contributing data to a centralised susceptibility database. participants were asked to determine susceptibilities to certain antibiotics by their routine method and return the data to the department of microbiology, royal hallamshire hospital, sheffield, for analysis. results: results for the overwhelming majority of organism/antibiotic combinations were in agreement with expected results. reasons for discrepancies included the non-bimodal distribution of susceptibilities, the use of different content discs, and, more importantly, minimum inhibitory concentrations falling close to breakpoint values. conclusions: it is inevitable that any large multicentre database will contain a degree of inaccurate data. this study has highlighted several areas where discrepant results have occurred and has enabled glaxo laboratories to approach individual laboratories to address this problem. this study emphasises the value and consistency of microbe base as the largest database, of its kind, nationally.

TI  == community acquired, nursing home acquired and hospital acquired pneumonia: a five-year review of the clinical, bacteriological and radiological characteristics.
AB  == purpose: to assess the contemporary clinical, bacteriological and radiographic features of hospitalized patients with community acquired (ca), nursing home acquired (na) and hospital acquired pneumonia (ha) and to examine patient outcome. patients and methods: all hospital records of patients with pneumonia over a five-year period from april 1987 to march 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. patients included in the study were all those with a diagnosis of pneumonia as identified by computer records of diagnostic codes at discharge;  patients with a specific diagnosis of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were excluded. of 74,435 discharges over the five-year period, 1782 patients met the inclusion criteria. results: charts of 1622 of the total 1782 cases were reviewed. mean age was 64.4 years with 59.4% men and 40.6% women. sixty-three per cent were ca, 28.5% were ha and 8.5% were na. a total of 1542 patients (95%) had  at least one concomitant medical condition. chest roentgenogram was abnormal in 97%. common organisms isolated overall were haemophilus influenzae (from 204 patients), staphylococcus aureas (from 152 patients), streptococcus pneumoniae (from 143 patients ), escherichia coli (from 113 patients) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (from 111 patients). h influenzae and s pneumoniae were most common in ca pneumonia, whereas s aureus and gram-negative organisms were more common in the ha group and gram-negative agents in the na group. one hundred and four patients developed complications. fifteen per cent required intensive care unit admission. the average length of hospitalization in the ca and na groups was 17 days and in the ha group, 43 days. at time of discharge 1261 patients (78%) were  cured or improved, and 361 patients (22%) died during the admission. conclusions: these results suggest that hospitalization for pneumonia in the 1990s is primarily for elderly patients with significant co-morbidity. although microbiology appears unchanged compared with earlier reports, the contemporary population is significantly sicker than previous cohorts. this may account for the persistently high morbidity and mortality despite better or newer antibiotics.

TI  == [pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  == isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (vc), forced expiratory volume (fev1.0), pao2 and paco2. vc of the patients from whom mssa (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus) or enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), branhamella catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) or haemophilus influenza (h. influenza)  were isolated. fev1.0 had a similar tendency as vc in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. similarly, po2 of the patients from whom mssa or e. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated, and pco2  of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza were isolated. there was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom  mssa, escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), xanthomonas maltophilia (x. maltophilia) or enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom s. pneumonia, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated. these results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza to mssa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, x. maltophilia or e. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. the treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

TI  == [epidemiology of antibiotic resistance: implications for empirical treatment in intensive care].
AB  == the adequacy of initial antibiotic therapy is an important prognostic factor in severe infections. concerning nosocomial infections, the selection of appropriate empirical therapy should take into account the incidence of offending pathogens within a specific unit. the changing trends in the hospital's microbial resistance patterns should be known to the physicians. the bacteria involved and  the susceptibility testing vary widely among institutions and among countries. many risk factors for acquisition of resistant pathogens have been identified. the duration of stay in hospital, previous colonization, and antibiotic treatment are the most frequently cited risk factors. when p. aeruginosa is suspected, an ureido-penicillin/aminoglycoside combination is usually effective. however, in some units with high levels of resistance, the beta-lactam should be ceftazidime  or imipenem. when enterobacteria are suspected, a third generation cephalosporin, alone or in combination with an amino-glycoside or a broad spectrum penicillin associated with a beta-lactamase inhibitor is appropriate. early nosocomial staphylococcal infections are treated with nafcillin or oxacillin, alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. in units with a high rate of mrsa, the initial antibiotic therapy should include a glycopeptide.

AB  == the object of this case control study was to evaluate the frequency, the risk factors, the microbiological spectrum and the outcome of 249 cases of bacteraemia observed in 209 hiv-infected patients, most them affected by aids. the rate of bacteraemia in the total yearly hiv-related admissions increased from 4% in 1985  to 13% in 1993. the more common aetiological agents of bacteraemia were: staphylococcus aureus (29.7%), non-typhoidal species of salmonella (14.1%), staphylococcus epidermidis (10.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae (8.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%). a mixed flora was found in 14% of the episodes. multivariate analysis of predisposing factors indicated that a low cd4+t-cell count (<0.2 x 10(9)/l) (p=0.01), use of central venous catheters (cvc) (p=0.01) and neutropenia (polymorphonuclear neutrophils <1.0 x 10(9)/l) (p=0.04) were independent risk factors for the development of bacteraemia. logistic regression  did not reveal any association of bacteraemia with intravenous drug abuse (on univariate analysis p=0.04). the response (31.8%). recurrences to specific therapy was favourable in 170 episodes (68.2%); death occurred in 79 (31.8%). recurrences arose in 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) of them died. the outcome of bacteraemia was influenced by a low number of cd4+t-cells (p<0.001) but not of polymorphonuclear cells. our findings suggest that bacteraemia is a relatively common event in hiv-infected patients, especially under particular conditions (e.g. intravenous drug abuse, use of cvc, neutropenia and a low cd4-t-cell count). it requires special attention from physicians who must recognise and treat the condition promptly at an early stage.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of june 1989 to may 1990. of the above total bacterial isolates, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a  majority of them were enterococcus faecalis. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were escherichia coli. 1. enterococcus faecalis imipenem (ipm) showed the highest activity against e. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. the followings, ampicillin (abpc) and vancomycin (vcm)  showed potent activities, with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. piperacillin (pipc), minocycline (mino) and chloramphenicol (cp) were also active with the mic90s of 8 micrograms/ml. the others were not so active with the mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. staphylococcus aureus vcm showed the highest activity  against s. aureus with mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. dicloxacillin (mdipc) and arbekacin (abk) were active with the mic90s of 2 micrograms/ml. mino showed the mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. all other agents except ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed lower activity. 3. staphylococcus epidermidis mino showed the highest activity against s. epidermidis. its mic90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. the followings, abk and  vcm were also active with the mic90s of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the others except cpfx were not so active. 4. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) most of the agents were active against cns. ipm, abk and mino showed the highest activities with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. mdipc, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm) and vcm were also active with the mic90s of 1 microgram/ml. clindamycin (cldm) showed lower activity, with the mic90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. streptococcus agalactiae cez, cefuzonam (czon), ipm and cldm showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the mic of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. the followings, cefmenoxime (cmx) and erythromycin (em) were active with the mic90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. pipc and vcm were also active with the mic90s 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively  amikacin (amk) showed lower activity. escherichia coli ipm, ctm, flomoxef (fmox), cmx, carumonam (crmn), norfloxacin (nflx), ofloxacin (oflx) and cpfx showed the highest activities against e. coli. the mic90s of them were .125 microgram/ml or  below. ceftazidime (caz) and czon were also active with the mic90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. penicillins except mecillinam (mpc) were not so active showing the  mic90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. klebsiella pneuminiae fmox, cmx, cefixime (cfix), ipm, crmn and nflx showed the highest activities against k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == bacterial pneumonia in adult patients with hiv infection.
AB  == patients with hiv infection are at increased risk for community-acquired bacterial pneumonias, due in part to their defects in b-cell function. streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest cause of community-acquired pneumonia,  with the second most common bacterial agent being haemophilus influenzae. these two organisms account for about two-thirds of community-acquired bacterial pneumonias. frequently bacterial pneumonias appear difficult to distinguish from  pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or other opportunistic lung infections, because of their atypical clinical and radiologic presentations. community-acquired pneumonias may be recurrent but have low fatality rates. in comparison, nosocomial pneumonias occur primarily in patients with aids and are usually due to staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic gram-negative  bacilli. nosocomial pneumonias have high fatality rates. s.aureus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with aids and has emerged as a secondary opportunist in lungs of patients with opportunistic diseases. while appropriate laboratory study is being done, empiric antibiotic therapy should be  directed against the microorganisms above described.

TI  == microbial etiology and predisposing factors among patients hospitalized for corneal ulceration.
AB  == objective: to report the spectrum of microorganisms causing corneal ulceration in patients treated on an inpatient basis and to characterize the predisposing factors. design: case series. setting: large university-affiliated hospital in toronto. patients: all inpatients with corneal ulcers managed between february 1991 and february 1993 (n = 95). results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (30% of the 60 culture-positive cases), staphylococcus aureus (23%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%) and moraxella (7%) were the predominant isolates. previous eye surgery (cataract extraction in 30 cases [32%], penetrating keratoplasty in 12 [13%] and both procedures in 9 [9%]) was a  common predisposing factor. eleven cases (12%) were associated with the use of contact lenses, in all cases extended-wear soft contact lenses; six patients wore bandage lenses and five wore contact lenses for cosmetic reasons. pseudomonas was the predominant isolate among contact lens wearers (four cases). most of the 95 cases involved older patients (average age 62.5 years) with concomitant eye or systemic disease. sixteen patients (17%) ultimately required penetrating keratoplasty. conclusions: recognition of the risk factors for corneal ulceration and prompt, intensive therapy are important to decrease the morbidity associated  with this potentially blinding disease.

TI  == [susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1991)].
AB  == isolated bacteria from respiratory tract infections were collected since 1981 in  cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, and have been investigated for their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and reported by ikemoto, et al. relationships between these isolates  and backgrounds of the patients were also studied each year. these results are discussed in detail in this report. in 20 institutions around the entire japan from october 1991 to september 1992, 631 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 529 patients with respiratory tract infections and tentatively determined to be etiological agents. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 96 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 112 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 111 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 114 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 41 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 39 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), klebsiella pneumoniae and some others, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were determined except for the strains that had been killed during transportation: 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for  58.3% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased over previous year's 42.5%. as shown by the mics, arbekacin was active as vancomycin against all the strains on s. aureus. 2. s. pneumoniae: benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed a potent activity against s. pneumoniae. cefuzonam, cefmenoxime, cefozopran and cefotaxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem; a penem antibiotic, showed the most potent activity with mic80 of 0.03 micrograms/ml. 3. h. influenzae: activities of all drugs were excellent against h. influenzae strains  tested. ampicillin showed mic80 of 1 micrograms/ml against h. influenzae. cefuzonam showed the most potent activity among cephems, it completely killed all bacteria at mic 0.06 micrograms/ml. cefotaxime and cefmenoxime showed next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.06 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid). ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), and their mic80s were 4 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid): similarly, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. k. pneumoniae: the activities of all drugs except for penicillins were very high against k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  == the palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. the antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. we find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good gram positive activity. for 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213. there is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the gram positive activity, particularly for s. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. the mic50 value for the most potent agents in this study against s. aureus atcc 29213 is 0.008 microgram/ml. by comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/ml, respectively, against this organism.

TI  == efficacy of meropenem in experimental meningitis.
AB  == meropenem and comparator antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, benzyl  penicillin and a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, were evaluated in a model of bacterial meningitis in the guinea-pig. the model is an acute infection  in which challenge with each organism, if untreated, causes an increase in numbers of white blood cells, elevation of protein concentrations and 6-8 log10 cfu/ml of bacteria in the csf. infections caused by haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, three strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (two penicillin-resistant), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and listeria monocytogenes all responded to meropenem, which was as active as the comparator agents in all studies, and was more active in most. of particular note were the results seen against s. pneumoniae (penicillin-resistant) infections, in which meropenem was significantly more effective than ceftriaxone. also notable were results from the p. aeruginosa infection where meropenem, at low doses, was more  effective than ceftazidime. activity against l. monocytogenes was equivalent to that produced by treatment with the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, even when treatment was delayed. these results show that, in an animal model, meropenem penetrates into csf in concentrations sufficient to produce significant reductions in the numbers of common and less common pathogens.

TI  == safety and efficacy of meropenem in patients with septicaemia: a randomised comparison with ceftazidime, alone or combined with amikacin.
AB  == meropenem is a new broad spectrum carbapenem antibiotic which can be administered as monotherapy for serious infections. the efficacy and safety of meropenem was compared with that of ceftazidime (alone or in combination with amikacin) in 153  patients with septicaemia who were enrolled into identical, prospective, randomised studies. forty-five patients with infections arising from the urinary  or lower respiratory tracts were given either meropenem 500 mg or ceftazidime 250-1000 mg intravenously every 8 h; 108 patients with more serious infections were given meropenem 1 g or ceftazidime 2 g every 8 h +/- amikacin 15 mg/kg/day.  overall, 71 patients received meropenem, 47 ceftazidime and 35 ceftazidime plus amikacin. comparable clinical response rates were achieved in the meropenem and ceftazidime/amikacin groups (92% vs 94% at the end of therapy respectively). furthermore, a satisfactory bacteriological response was obtained in all evaluable patients. the most common pathogens isolated were escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. relapse occurred in one patient in the ceftazidime/amikacin group, who had a mixed infection of e. coli and p. aeruginosa. there were no relapses in the meropenem group. both treatments were well tolerated and only one patient had to withdraw from the trial because of an adverse effect (rash associated with ceftazidime). in conclusion, these data confirm that meropenem monotherapy is well tolerated and is as effective as  ceftazidime (alone or combined with amikacin) in the empirical treatment of septicaemia. it should prove to be a useful addition to the drugs currently available for this life-threatening disease.

TI  == treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients--a comparison of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin. copd study group.
AB  == meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were compared in an open, randomised prospective multicentre study in the treatment of acute exacerbations of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients. one-hundred-and-seventy-three patients were enrolled; 164 were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 98 for bacteriological efficacy, with 144 pathogens isolated. the predominant pathogens were haemophilus influenzae (n = 30), streptococcus pneumoniae (18), staphylococcus aureus (12), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), moraxella catarrhalis (8), other gram-negative bacteria (neisseria, klebsiella, proteus, and enterobacter spp.) (53) and other gram-positive bacteria (12). a single bacterial pathogen was identified in 61 patients, whereas two bacterial pathogens were isolated in 31 patients and three in six patients. the clinical response at the end of treatment was very high in both groups with a satisfactory outcome (cured or improved) in 97.6% of the meropenem patients and in 96.3% of the imipenem/cilastatin patients; at follow-up the rates were 89.1% and 89.8%, respectively. the bacterial success (eradication or presumed eradication) was 88.2% in the meropenem group and 89.4% in the comparator group.  nausea or vomiting were reported more frequently in patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin, whereas in the meropenem group an increase in aminotransferases was reported. one patient treated with imipenem/cilastatin was  withdrawn from the study due to seizures. meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were  highly effective for the treatment of severe bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis but meropenem was better tolerated.

TI  == meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to  all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  all enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococcus faecium are  uniformly resistant to meropenem. the meropenem mics for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by mics of < or = 4 mg/l, intermediate susceptibility by mics of 8 mg/l and mics of > or = 16 mg/l define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system,  some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem  demonstrated in vitro. these factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal mics for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.

TI  == brain abscess in children: microbiology and management.
AB  == brain abscess is a serious, life-threatening infection. the infection can originate from contiguous sites of existing infections, such as chronic otitis media, dental infection, mastoiditis, or sinusitis, where anaerobic bacteria predominate. the infection can also occur in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, in whom the predominant organisms are viridans, microaerophilic, or anaerobic streptococci, or after head trauma, in which case staphylococcus aureus, viridans cocci, and streptococcus pneumoniae are the most prevalent isolates. enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yeast, fungi, and mycobacteria are prevalent in the immunocompromised. radioisotope brain scans, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are important tools that enable accurate diagnosis of the infection. proper selection of antimicrobial with good intracranial penetration is essential in the management of intracranial infection. delay in surgical drainage can be associated with high mortality or morbidity. however, brain abscess, especially in the early phase of cerebritis, may respond to antimicrobial therapy without surgical drainage.

TI  == virulence factors in the colonization and persistence of bacteria in the airways.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly isolated from sputum specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract  infections. haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and m. catarrhalis have several pathogenic properties in common. these bacteria are able to interact with mucus, to exert ciliotoxic activity, to adhere to bronchial epithelial cells, and to invade airway epithelium. haemophilus influenzae and s. pneumoniae strains persist for many months in the respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), despite the specific antibodies present in  serum and sputum against the persistent strain. especially during exacerbations persistent strains with changes in their antigenic composition are isolated. among h. influenzae strains, the antigenic characteristics of the outer membrane  protein composition vary. variation in s. pneumoniae occurs in capsular polysaccharides, the major immunogens of this bacterium. such variations affect the efficacy of the antibody-mediated defense mechanisms against the bacteria. between exacerbations, particularly h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae strains are recovered from the sputum of patients with copd. recovery may continue for periods up to 2 yr, although not continuously. besides ineffective antibody-mediated defense mechanisms, it is likely that hiding of the bacteria in tissue contributes to the persistence of these bacteria in patients with copd.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == efficacies of abt-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. these compounds are potent bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors  which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring  juncture. abt-719 is an s isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. abt-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. abt-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the racemate and r forms of abt-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the 50% effective doses of abt-719 were at least threefold  lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused  by salmonella typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes. in immunosuppressed mice, abt-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. the pharmacokinetic properties of abt-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. the 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of abt-719, a novel dna gyrase inhibitor.
AB  == abt-719 (a-86719.1) is the first compound of a new class of novel dna gyrase inhibitors, the 2-pyridones, with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. abt-719 was more active than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and clinafloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. abt-719 was particularly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [mic90] = 0.015 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.03 micrograms/ml). abt-719 was also the most  active of the compounds tested against ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus isolates, with an mic90 of 0.25 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. against gram-negative organisms, abt-719 was as active as or slightly more active than ciprofloxacin and was the most active compound against  ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 = 2.0 micrograms/ml). abt-719 was also the most active compound against both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefpodoxime proxetil, a new oral cephem, in the treatment of respiratory tract infections with the special reference to community-acquired  streptococcus pneumoniae infections].
AB  == the clinical usefulness of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr) was investigated in the treatment of pneumonia and chronic airway infections occurring in patients first  visiting our outpatient clinic or those being treated at the outpatient clinic. cpdx-pr was orally administered twice a day after meals at a dose of 100-200 mg for acute respiratory tract infections and at a dose of 200 mg for chronic respiratory tract infections. excellent, good, fair, and poor responses were observed in 20, 33, 10, and 3 of 66 patients (4 with acute bronchitis, 27 with pneumonia, and 35 with acute exacerbation of chronic airway infection), respectively, demonstrating an 80.3% efficacy rate (53/66). causative organisms,  including streptococcus pneumoniae, were all eradicated from the patients whose causative organisms were examined over time, although 2 of the patients were superinfected with pseudomonas aeruginosa. there were no serious adverse reactions or abnormal changes in laboratory test results. it was concluded that cpdx-pr could be used as a first-choice drug for the treatment of respiratory tract infections at an outpatient clinic, and that this drug should acquire greater importance in particular consideration of recent increases in infections  with s. pneumoniae.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in  japan.
AB  == bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and  891 were gram-negative. major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the mic's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pnuemoniae and s. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. new quinolones and new generation cephems were active against h. influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. only one strain of s. aureus was methicillin-resistant. as regards other pathogens, 6.5% of s. pneumoniae and 14.9% of h. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of  h. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. mrsa was found infrequently. but ampicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of new quinolones against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria obtained using agar-dilution and broth-microdilution procedures were compared. a primary regression curve and a correlation coefficient (r) between 2 mics for each of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin,  tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin or balofloxacin were calculated. for the 5 quinolones, average correlation coefficients were 0.891 for the gram-positive bacteria tested, and 0.865 for the gram-negative bacteria. the range of, correlation coefficients for the gram-positive bacteria for these drugs was from 0.835 to 0.919, and that for the gram-negative bacteria was from 0.815 to 0.865. from these data, it is clear that there is a good correlation between the 2 mics of the new quinolones obtained using the agar-dilution and the broth-microdilution procedures. it was also shown that the value of the slope of the regression curves were nearly the same for the 5 quinolones tested. however, some particular strains of morganella morganii, pseudomonas cepacia, xanthomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited different correlation coefficients from other strains.

TI  == multicentre comparative study on the antibacterial activity of fk-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of fk-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin structurally related to cefpirome and cefepime, was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefpirome, cefepime, imipenem and meropenem against 1,837 clinical isolates obtained from three spanish hospitals. fk-037 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae isolates at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml, with the exception of enterobacter aerogenes (mic90 1 microgram/ml), enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic90 8 micrograms/ml). in cefotaxime- and ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing shv-2 and shv-6 beta-lactamases, the activity of fk-037, cefpirome and cefepime was similar (mic  range 0.25-32 micrograms/ml). in enterobacteriaceae strains hyper-producing chromosomally inducible beta-lactamases, fk-037 (mic90 range, 0.25-8 micrograms/ml) was 8- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime but  two- to eightfold less active than cefpirome and cefepime. fk-037 and cefpirome were twofold more active than ceftazidime and cefepime against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, with mic90 values of 16 micrograms/ml. the activity of fk-037, cefpirome and cefepime was two- to eightfold lower in ceftazidime-resistant derepressed pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants. fk-037 (mic range, 0.12-2 micrograms/ml) and the other beta-lactam agents tested were active  against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci; however, only cefpirome and, particularly, fk-037 (mic90 of 32 micrograms/ml) displayed some activity against  methicillin-resistant strains. in penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, the mic90s of fk-037 were 0.03, 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == influence of pulmonary surfactant on in vitro bactericidal activities of amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin.
AB  == the influence of a natural pulmonary surfactant on antibiotic activity was investigated to assess the possible use of exogenous surfactant as a vehicle for  antibiotic delivery to the lung. the influence of surfactant on the bactericidal  activity of amoxicillin was tested against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, and the influence of surfactant on the activities of ceftazidime and tobramycin was tested against klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, s. aureus, and s. pneumoniae. in vitro antibiotic activity was determined by killing curve studies in media with and without surfactant. amoxicillin and ceftazidime activities were not changed in the presence of surfactant, except for a decreased killing rate of s. pneumoniae by ceftazidime in medium with additional rabbit serum. in contrast, killing curves with low concentrations of tobramycin (0.25x and 1x the mic) showed a decreased level of activity of tobramycin against all pathogens tested in the presence of surfactant. with higher tobramycin concentrations (4x the mic) killing rates were decreased less or were unchanged in the presence of surfactant. concluding from the results of the study, both amoxicillin and ceftazidime can be combined with surfactant without the loss of activity. for mixing surfactant with tobramycin, dosages should be adjusted to overcome the partial inactivation of tobramycin by  surfactant.

TI  == [mechanism of antibiotic resistance in bacteria responsible for respiratory infections].
AB  == bacterial resistance is both a frequent phenomena and in perpetual evolution; currently it effects all antibiotics. the acquisition of resistance is a result of chromosomal mutations or is a contribution of genetic material either as plasmids or transposons. the principle mechanisms which can be isolated or associated can be grouped together under changes of bacterial permeability which  alters the target of the anti-infectious agents; or the synthesis of enzymes which inhibit the activity of the antibiotic. some micro-organisms such as staphylococcal aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and certain enterobacteria have developed resistance to varying degrees against the antibiotics initially or more recently introduced which pose, in some cases, very real therapeutic problems. the prescribing doctor should recognise the principle bacterial phenotypes which are resistant, as well  as the rules of association of the different antibiotics in order to institute an effective anti-infectious regime, which allows the cure of the patient and limits any introduction of resistance or the selection of resistant mutants.

TI  == structure and functions of endotoxin-binding peptides derived from cap18.
AB  == cap18 (cationic antimicrobial protein, 18kda) is a 142 amino acid protein originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using agglutination of lps-coated erythrocytes as an assay. cap-18 is composed of an n-terminal domain of unknown function (cap181-105) and a c-terminal lps-binding domain (cap18106-142). synthetic cap18106-142 and cap18106-137, a 32-amino acid peptide resulting from the truncation of 5 amino acids from the c-terminus of cap18106-142, inhibited lps-induced tissue factor generation, nitric oxide production and tnf release by  macrophages. mice treated with cap18106-142 or cap18106-137 were significantly protected from lps lethality. although cap18106-142 and cap18106-137 were highly  active, other fragments of cap18106-142, including cap18110-142 with a truncated  n-terminus, did not exhibit lps-binding and lps-neutralizing activities. both peptides had broad anti-microbial activity against both gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa (ic50; 40-100 nm) and gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus(methicillin sensitive and resistant strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (ic50; 100-200nm). we cloned a cap18 family protein from human granulocytes. the cloned cdna encoded 140 amino acid residues. human cap18  (cap181-140) was highly homologous to that of rabbit. a 32- amino-acid c-terminal fragment (cap18104-135) was shown to bind lps, inhibit lps-induced tissue factor  generation by murine macrophages, and protect mice from lps lethality. this peptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesize that cap18 and the derived peptides bind to lps and alter the capacity of lps to initiate disseminated intravascular coagulation. in this regard, cap may act as host defense protein against infectious diseases, and have therapeutic potential for sepsis and endotoxin shock.

TI  == laboratory data which differentiate meropenem and imipenem.
AB  == meropenem and imipenem are carbapenems which are distinguishable from all other currently available beta-lactam antibiotics by breadth of antibacterial spectrum  and stability to beta-lactamases, but can be differentiated one from another. meropenem is relatively stable to human renal dehydropeptidase-i (dhp-i); it does not require to be co-administered with cilastatin and consequently, unlike imipenem, will be administered as a single agent. in vitro both meropenem and imipenem are active against almost all clinically important aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. differences in potency are seen but few may be of clinical significance: imipenem is more active against enterococci and meropenem is more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, haemophilus influenzae and proteus, morganella and providencia species. the primary target of imipenem is pbp2 in p. aeruginosa whilst meropenem has high affinity for both pbp2 and 3; this may contribute to greater potency against this organism. laboratory evaluations predict that meropenem will not be seizurogenic, which combined with activity against likely pathogens, identified its potential for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. this has been investigated in a guinea-pig model in which meropenem exhibited potent activity against the common meningeal pathogens and also infections caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae or listeria monocytogenes. clinical experience will determine the significance of these differences.

TI  == sinusitis in human immunodeficiency virus infection: typical and atypical organisms.
AB  == the majority of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection will develop acute sinusitis. this may be a single episode, or may be the beginning of a long course of recurrent sinusitis, of which the etiology is not yet well understood. a retrospective study of cultures from antral washings was conducted  to determine the organisms that were more commonly isolated in patients with hiv  infection and sinusitis. forty-seven organisms were isolated from the sinus cultures of 41 hiv-positive patients. the most common organisms isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), streptococcus viridans (19%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%). pseudomonas aeruginosa is an atypical cause of acute sinusitis  in the general population but was found to be an important pathogen in our hiv-infected patients. other atypical organisms were also isolated, including listeria monocytogenes and candida albicans. it is important to recognize that atypical organisms must be considered if an hiv-infected patient with sinusitis does not respond to initial antibiotic therapy. a discussion follows emphasizing  the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of sinusitis in hiv infection.

AB  == in vitro studies on the activity of cefprozil have been conducted in europe and north america. against gram-negative bacilli, cefprozil and cefaclor are at least two to four times more active than cephalexin. cefixime is more active against these organisms. against gram-positive cocci, cefprozil is at least two to four times more active than cefaclor and cephalexin; cefixime has limited gram-positive activity, and is particularly inactive against staphylococci (mic90 32 mg/l). cefprozil is highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (unlike cefixime). those strains of this genus that display intermediate resistance to pneumococci are more susceptible to cefprozil than cefaclor. neisseria species and moraxella catarrhalis are susceptible to cefprozil (mic90 0.06 and 1 mg/l). beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae appear to be susceptible to cefprozil, as the reported mic90 is 2-4 mg/l. enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and those strains of the enterobacteriaceae that commonly possess a chromosomal cephalosporinase (e.g., providencia, morganella and enterobacter) are generally considered to be resistant to cefprozil as well as to other oral cephalosporins. cefprozil appears to display enhanced stability to the commonly encountered tem-1 and shv-1 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, as found in haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and the enterobacteriaceae. cefprozil is rapidly absorbed, reaching a maximum concentration 0.9 to 1.2 h post-dose. following oral doses of 250 and 500 mg, the cmax is 6.2 and 10.0 mg/l  respectively. serum half-lives are generally reported as between 1.2 and 1.4 h, and urine recovery is high, 57-70%.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the antibacterial activity of opc-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. the pharmacokinetic profiles of opc-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. opc-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. opc-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the mics of this compound for  90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. the in vitro antibacterial activity of opc-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. opc-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. in comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of opc-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. opc-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. this excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.

TI  == bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis in human immunodeficiency virus infection.
AB  == background: bacterial pneumonia and sinusitis are important causes of morbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. we noted an increased incidence of bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis in our patients with hiv infection. methods: this study was conducted on persons with hiv infection at a county hospital and clinic. bronchiectasis was diagnosed by bronchogram and computed tomography in one patient and by computed tomography alone in two others. bacterial bronchitis was defined by a gram's stain showing an abundance of neutrophils with a predominance of one or more bacteria and by a  confirmatory sputum culture. bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage was performed in patients with bronchitis to eliminate other causes of bronchial inflammation. results: eighteen episodes of bacterial bronchitis in 10 patients are described. the mean cd4 lymphocyte counts for these patients was 0.061 x 10(9)/l (range, 0.001 to 0.203 x 10(9)/l). the most common pathogens in 18 episodes of bacterial bronchitis were haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae (five episodes each) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (four episodes). response to antibiotic therapy was usually rewarding though recurrences were frequent. three patients with well-defined bronchiectasis who appeared to have developed, or who became symptomatic during the course of, hiv infection are described. their mean cd4 cell count was 0.03 x 10(9)/l (range, 0.024 to 0.037 x  10(9)/l). haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas cepacia, and p aeruginosa were recovered from these patients; the p aeruginosa was a mucoid strain. conclusions: recurrent bacterial bronchitis should be added to the list of bacterial infections that occur with increased frequency with hiv infection. repeated bacterial bronchitis may lead to bronchiectasis, which may be more common in hiv infection than generally appreciated.

AB  == a prospective study of specimens of lower airway secretions was carried out in order to investigate the association of specimen quality and results of microbiological culture. the quality of expectorates (exp) or aspirates from larynx/trachea (alt) was assessed on the basis of numbers per low power field (<  1, 1-10, 11-25, and > 25) of squamous epithelial cells (sec) and leukocytes, respectively. specimens were classified as either acceptable, a (< or = 10 sec),  partly acceptable, b (11-25 sec, > 25 leukocytes), or not acceptable, c (the remaining specimens). six hundred and six specimens (385 exp, 221 alt) from 408 patients were included, and the distribution among categories was a 373 (62%), b  88 (15%), and c 144 (24%). for isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 42) and  haemophilus influenzae (n = 51) there was a statistically significant association with specimen quality, and for aerobic bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa  a trend was noted. however, isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 105), staphylococcus aureus (n = 61), yeasts (n = 45) and branhamella catarrhalis (n =  7) were not associated with specimen quality. it is concluded that a defined set  of criteria allows a useful classification of exp and alt by direct microscopy and that it is justifiable not to cultivate specimens found not to be acceptable  (category c).

TI  == soluble human complement receptor type 1 inhibits complement-mediated host defense.
AB  == soluble complement receptor type 1 (scr1) is a powerful inhibitor of complement activation. because of this ability, scr1 may prove to be an important therapeutic agent that can be used to block the immunopathologic effects of uncontrolled complement activation in a variety of clinically significant disorders. although several previous studies have examined the ability of scr1 to inhibit complemented-mediated immunopathologic damage, there is no information on its ability to interfere with the host's defense against infection. in the current experiments scr1 exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the phagocytosis of streptococcus pneumoniae by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro. not only di scr1 inhibit complement-dependent opsonization of the pneumococcus but at higher concentrations it also inhibited the ingestion  of bacteria which had been previously opsonized. furthermore, when rats were injected with scr1, it inhibited both their serum hemolytic activity and serum opsonic activity in a dose-dependent fashion. finally, for rats treated with scr1, the 50% lethal dose was s. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. these data demonstrate that scr1 significantly inhibits complement-mediated host against bacterial infection.

TI  == pharmacokinetic considerations in the treatment of bacterial keratitis.
AB  == the eye is relatively impermeable to micro-organisms and other environmental elements. however, if corneal integrity is breached by trauma, a sight-threatening bacterial infection can result. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common bacterial pathogens associated with infection of compromised corneas. bacterial enzymes and toxins, as well as factors associated with the host immune response,  can lead to tissue destruction during corneal infection. for successful therapy,  an antibacterial agent must be active against the pathogen and must be able to overcome the permeability barrier of the cornea. topical application of antibacterial agents adequately delivers drugs to the cornea and aqueous humour.  however, drug concentrations at the site of infection are not always sufficient to rapidly kill infective organisms. infections with antibiotic-resistant strains present an even greater therapeutic challenge. in addition, sterilisation of the  cornea by antibacterial agents does not eliminate inflammation and corneal scarring that accompany infection. steroidal and non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents limit corneal scarring during experimentally induced bacterial keratitis.  however, although promising, concomitant use of these drugs with antibacterial agents remains controversial. two ocular drug delivery systems that provide high  and sustained concentrations of drug to ocular tissues are corneal collagen shields and transcorneal iontophoresis. the collagen shield, originally designed  as a bandage lens, prolongs drug contact with the cornea. chemotherapeutic studies of experimental bacterial keratitis demonstrate that shields hydrated with antibacterial agents reduce bacteria in the cornea as well as or better than frequent applications of fortified antibacterial drops. transcorneal iontophoresis uses an electric current to drive charged drugs into the cornea. in experimentally induced bacterial keratitis, transcorneal iontophoresis of antibacterial agents is superior to topically administered ocular drops for reducing the numbers of bacteria in the cornea. although both drug delivery systems appear to be well tolerated and nontoxic in animal models, clinical trials in patients are required to determine the usefulness of these drug delivery systems in clinical trials. based on present experimental results, future therapy of bacterial keratitis will involve efficient drug delivery devices, the use of new antibacterial agents or combinations of presently available antibacterial agents, and careful use of adjuvant anti-inflammatory agents.

AB  == forty-three medical centers participated in a national (united states) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500  strains, 200 per laboratory). all laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips. quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. the most common isolates were escherichia coli (1648), staphylococcus aureus (1408), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against gram-positive aerobes. several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the united  states: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, including e. coli and klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (14.9%). fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an esbl and resistance to aminoglycosides. clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. this national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of  emerging resistant bacteria. continued us surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize  its occurrence.

TI  == penicillin g/ofloxacin versus erythromycin/amoxicillin-clavulanate in the treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == in a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, the efficacy of penicillin plus  ofloxacin was compared to that of amoxicillin-clavulanate plus erythromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. one hundred seventeen hospitalized patients presenting with severe community-acquired pneumonia received either penicillin 3 x 10(6) u/6 h plus ofloxacin 200 mg twice daily (group a) or amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g/6 h plus erythromycin 1 g/8 h (group b). initial assessment included clinical examination, determination of simplified acute physiology score (saps), chest x-ray and evaluation of microbiological data obtained from blood, sputum and/or bronchoscopy. follow-up was documented at 72 h and at 30 days. both groups were comparable for age, sex, saps, chest x-ray, hypoxemia and microbiological data. the causative pathogen was identified in 54 cases (53%), streptococcus pneumoniae being most frequent isolate (54.7%). all organisms cultured were susceptible to at least one of the antibiotics of each combination of the protocol, with the exception of two strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. a favorable outcome was observed in 76% of the patients, equally distributed between the two groups. after completion of therapy there were 12 clinical failures in each group (20.5%). six patients in each group (10.3%) died  of infection. tolerance was similar for both regimens, apart from an increased rate of superficial thrombophlebitis in patients receiving intravenous erythromycin. the combination of penicillin with ofloxacin is as effective and as safe as a previously recommended regimen combining amoxicillin-clavulanate and erythromycin in treating patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == [s. pneumoniae sternoclavicular arthritis in a patient with hiv infection].
AB  == hiv infection is a predisposing factor for pneumococcic infection. while pneumonia is the most frequent location, other locations (articular, meningeal, endocardiac, etc) have been less frequently described. among the articular infections described in patients with hiv infection, the sternoclavicular affection is extremely rare and it usually develops in association with parenterally drug addiction, being staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa the most frequently germs involved. we describe the first case of sternoclavicular arthritis by streptococcus pneumoniae in a patient with hiv infection. in our case, the chronic hepatopathy associated to alcohol consumption is a predisposing factor related to the pneumococcic infection. our case suggests the need to formally investigate the hiv infection in young patients with invasive pneumococcic infection.

TI  == efficacy and safety of long-term ciprofloxacin in the management of severe bronchiectasis.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of long-term ciprofloxacin therapy in the management of severe bronchiectasis were retrospectively assessed in patients who had taken oral ciprofloxacin continuously for at least 90 days. the drug was well tolerated, with only one reported side effect. treatment resulted in a symptomatic improvement in seven of the ten patients and significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rate and residual volume. there was a decrease in the number of infective exacerbations from 6.2 +/- 2.9 during 365 days to 0.5 +/- 0.53 during 412 days. resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in 2 patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and this was associated with clinical deterioration, but in a further two patients with p. aeruginosa the pathogen was  eradicated. two patients had persistent streptococcus pneumoniae cultured from sputum but this was not associated with clinical deterioration. the study suggests that ciprofloxacin is effective and safe in the long-term treatment of chronic bronchial sepsis due to bronchiectasis, but emergence of p. aeruginosa resistance is of some concern.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sepsis-induced apoptosis of the thymocytes in mice.
AB  == intraperitoneal injection of gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) induces thymic atrophy in mice. the thymus weight, cell number, and viability began to decrease at 3 h, and reached their lowest level at 72 h. the thymocyte death was associated with dna fragmentation of approximately 200 base pairs in ladder form. the kinetic study on histopathology revealed the process of thymocyte death and thymic atrophy. flow-cytometric analysis showed that cd4+cd8+ thymocytes decreased predominantly. lps caused thymocyte apoptosis, but only in lps-responder mice, unlike gram-negative bacteria that induced apoptosis in both lps-responder (c3h/hen) and lps-nonresponder (c3h/hej). gram-positive bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae also  caused apoptosis in lps-nonresponder (c3h/hej) and lps-responder mice (b6). the kinetics of serum tnf-alpha production after gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria injection was slightly different. e. coli induced serum tnf-alpha peak at 1 h in b6 mice, whereas s. pneumoniae induced a peak at 6 h in c3h/hej and at  9 h in b6 mice. similarly, s. pneumoniae induced thymocyte apoptosis around 9 to  12 h, which was 6 to 9 h later than that observed with e. coli in b6 mice. anti-tnf-alpha ab completely blocked the e. coli-induced thymocyte apoptosis, but was only partially inhibitory on the s. pneumoniae-induced thymocyte apoptosis. furthermore, thymocyte apoptosis induced by e. coli was inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin d. these data indicate that both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria could induce thymus atrophy via apoptosis, and that tnf-alpha is a common denominator released and might be responsible for the thymocyte apoptosis.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  == the antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, dtic, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin g, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-fc, and amphotericin b were studied on 57 bacterial strains. the bacterial species investigated were escherischia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. the antineoplastic drugs were diluted in muller-hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. for the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the pdm epsilometer test. seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents  displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. a most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased  sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.

TI  == nutritional profile and antimicrobial spectrum of the spice aframomum danielli k. schum.
AB  == the spice, aframomum danielli, on a wet weight basis with a moisture content of 10.5%, protein content of 8.2% (dry matter basis) and caloric value of 469.7 kcal/100 g, contains in varying amounts, minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc and copper. amino acids found in varying concentrations in a. danielli include l-threonine, l-serine, l-valine, l-proline, l-glutamic acid, glycine, l-leucine and l-lysine. using minimum inhibition zone of 20-22 mm in diameter, a. danielli inhibited the growth of salmonella enteriditis, psudomonas fragi, pseudomonas fluorescens, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, aspergillus flavus, a. parasiticus, a. ochraceus and a. niger. the minimum concentration (mic) determined for klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 in 320 whilst the mic for s. aureus was 1 in 8,000.

TI  == [antibiotic activities of cefpirome against fresh clinical isolates resistant to  multiple drugs].
AB  == using multiple drug-resistant clinical isolates isolated since september 1992, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpirome (cpr) were determined. several control drugs were also used, and these mic-determinations were made to determine the antibiotic activity of cpr. the obtained results are summarized as  follows: 1. antibiotic activities of cpr against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, and benzylpenicillin-insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae showed that expanded antibacterial spectrum of cpr and its enhanced antibiotic action against gram-positive bacteria. we suggest that among the existing fourth-generation cephem antibiotics, cpr is "characteristically strong against gram-positive bacteria". 2. strong antibiotic  activities of cpr were recognized against bacteria of family enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to the third-generation cephems. the strong antibiotic activities appeared to be due to cpr's stability and decreased affinity for beta-lactamase. 3. antibacterial spectrum of cpr was expanded against non-glucose fermented gram-negative bacilli including pseudomonas aeruginosa. it appears that this expansion of antibacterial spectrum is due to cpr's affinities for a wide range of penicillin-binding proteins as well as its improved permeability into tissues.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect associated with rabbit primary aqueous humour.
AB  == viability curves were recorded for a variety of bacteria suspended in rabbit primary aqueous humour. controls included neat rabbit serum, dilute rabbit serum  (1/50), dilute heat treated fetal bovine serum (1/50), and balanced salt solution. rabbit aqueous humour was bactericidal in vitro for staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. micrococcus spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and  escherichia coli were not affected. the factor mediating the bactericidal effect  survives filtration (0.2 micron porosity) and freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees c) but is labile when stored in air at temperatures of 4 degrees c, 25 degrees c, and 37 degrees c for 1 hour. the bactericidal effect was stable when aqueous humour was stored in an atmosphere of 5% co2 at 37 degrees c for 3 hours. the antibacterial component in rabbit aqueous humour has yet to be identified.

TI  == the antibody response of vitamin a-deficient rats to pneumococcal polysaccharide  is enhanced through coimmunization with lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == although the antibody response of vitamin a-deficient rats immunized with pneumococcal polysaccharide (sss-iii) was barely detectable, coimmunization with  sss-iii plus 2 or 20 micrograms of pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (lps) resulted in an anti-sss-iii response that was equal to or greater than that of vitamin a-sufficient rats immunized only with sss-iii. doses of 2 and 20 micrograms of lps, but not 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms, produced significant adjuvanticity, and lps functioned as an adjuvant when given concomitantly with sss-iii (day 0) or up to 3 days later. thus, vitamin a deficiency per se does not preclude the anti-sss-iii response, and lps or factors released in response to lps, even after initiation of the response to sss-iii, may substantially enhance  antibody production to this thymus-independent, type 2 antigen.

TI  == comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  == the study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/l for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. for the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/l for ofloxacin. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) and serum bactericidal activity (sba) for each  drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter anitratus, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against a. anitratus. mbcs for the two drugs were similar for h. influenzae and s. aureus. oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent sba. similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent sba. for the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak sba was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. at peak concentrations, both drugs had modest sba against p. aeruginosa, a. anitratus, and s. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == re-evaluation of pneumonia requiring admission to an intensive care unit: a prospective study.
AB  == background: appropriate treatment of severe community and hospital acquired pneumonias requiring admission to a medical intensive care unit depends on knowledge of the likely aetiological agents in any community. little is known about the pattern and outcome of patients with such pneumonias in saudi arabia. methods: in a prospective study 113 patients with pneumonia were investigated in  the medical intensive care unit at king khalid university hospital, riyadh, saudi arabia between september 1991 and december 1992. the diagnosis was established by microscopy and culture of sputum, blood culture, or serological examination. a standard proforma was used to collect demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. results: a microbiological diagnosis was made in 80% of the cases with a single pathogen accounting for 69% of the isolates and multiple pathogens for 11%. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common infecting agent (16%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), staphylococcus aureus (9%), and mycobacterium tuberculosis (8%). pneumonia due to legionella pneumophilia was diagnosed in three patients and infection due to mycoplasma pneumoniae in two. these five cases were identified by serological examination. gram negative rods were the predominant pathogens in both community and hospital acquired pneumonia. the aetiology of pneumonia was not identified in 20% of cases. the overall mortality  was 37%. patients with hospital acquired pneumonia had a higher mortality than those with a community acquired pneumonia. similarly, a high mortality was found  in patients who had a serious underlying disease, abnormal mental state, diastolic blood pressure < 60 mm hg, blood urea > 7 mmol/l, abnormal liver function tests, serum albumin < 30 g/l, those who required mechanical ventilatory support, and those with apache ii scores > 20. conclusions: this study highlights two major findings which differ from previous reports on the aetiology of pneumonia. firstly, gram negative rods were the predominant pathogens in community acquired pneumonia and secondly, m tuberculosis was an important cause  of pneumonia in these patients, indicating that tuberculous pneumonia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia in saudi arabia.

TI  == microbiology and management of otitis media.
AB  == otitis media is a complex and multifactorial condition with four defined stages:  myringitis, acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants,  mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. the rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation has been associated with the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. in acute otitis media the major organisms, present are haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. in chronic otitis media these organisms, plus staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. the microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. empirical therapy can  be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. however, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromised and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. the growing resistance of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. by adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as pseudomonas spp. where present.

TI  == the role of hsv-induced fc- and c3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  == herpes simplex virus type-1 (hsv-1) induces fc- and c3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. the role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to hsv-infected and non-infected hep-2 cells. a flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of fitc-labelled bacteria, was developed. opsonisation of staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in  adherence to hsv-infected cells and revealed a role for c3b(i)r- and fcr-mediated adhesion. however, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment  to non-infected cells. increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and  pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the hsv-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of e. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to hsv-infected cells.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

TI  == cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  n-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria rapidly. in addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. it has good affinity for pbps 2 and 3 of escherichia coli and for pbp 3 of pseudomonas aeruginosa. its broad-spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. it is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against enterobacteriaceae. the mic90 for p. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those  of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. other gram-negative organisms, haemophilus influenzae, neiserria meningitidis, neiserria gonorrhoeae, moraxella  catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. among gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae. only strains of p. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. in experimental infections such as meningitis, induced  with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.

AB  == since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. we evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (uti) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (s/sti) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either uti or lrti (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned uti and lrti groups. amongst the pathogens isolated (36 gram-positive, 150 gram-negative), the most predominant species were escherichia coli in uti and bacteraemia (n = 81), streptococcus pneumoniae in lrti and bacteraemia (n = 23),  haemophilus influenzae in lrti (n = 16), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in s/sti. the mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial uti, lrti and s/sti, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. the bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species  of aerobic gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in  hospitalized patients.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin following multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers.
AB  == fourteen adult males participated in a randomized three-way crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (sbts) of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen a), 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (regimen b), and 400 mg of ofloxacin (regimen c) administered every 12 h for seven doses. mean steady-state  peak concentrations in serum for regimens a, b, and c were 3.0, 4.4, and 6.5 micrograms/ml, respectively (p < 0.01, all comparisons) and mean half-lives were  4.5, 4.3, and 6.5 h, respectively (p < 0.05, c versus a and b). mean steady-state areas under the concentration-time curve were 14.1, 21.1, and 48.1 micrograms/h/ml for regimens a, b, and c, respectively (p < 0.05, all comparisons). sbts were determined at different times postdose for three isolates each of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mean steady-state peak sbts for regimens a, b, and c, respectively, were as follows: s. pneumoniae, < 1:2, 1:8, 1:8, s. aureus, 1:16, 1:16, 1:16; e. coli, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; e. cloacae, 1: > or = 128, 1: > or = 128, 1:64; p. aeruginosa, 1:8, 1:8, 1:2. these  differences in sbts within each genus were statistically significant. the majority of predicted sbts were within one dilution of measured sbts. areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for e. coli, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa were significantly higher for ciprofloxacin; areas under the serum bactericidal time curves for s. pneumoniae and s. aureus were significantly greater for ofloxacin. ofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in serum than ciprofloxacin,  but differences in in vitro activity were a more important determinant of sbts.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == [a clinical study of chronic lower respiratory tract infections with pseudomonas  aeruginosa by transtracheal aspiration].
AB  == we investigated the yearly changes of the incidence of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) isolated from chronic lower respiratory tract infections (clrti), and also performed a clinical study on clrti with p. aeruginosa by transtracheal aspiration (tta) to clarify the recent trend of p. aeruginosa infection in clrti  and the predisposing clinical factors to the acute exacerbation. the isolation rate of p. aeruginosa among the total isolated bacteria in clrti between december 1978 and march 1983 was 8.4%, but it increased to 23.1% between april 1988 and march 1993. in 69 episodes (40 cases) of p. aeruginosa isolated from clrti between april 1983 and march 1993, monomicrobial infections of p. aeruginosa were 42 episodes (60.9%) and polymicrobial infections were 27 episodes (39.1%). when the diseases were classified into acute exacerbated and non-exacerbated phases, polymicrobial infections were seen more in the former phase, and the principal organisms detected with p. aeruginosa were haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. in the acute exacerbated cases, predisposing conditions concerning the exacerbation were divided into four patterns: 1. polymicrobial infections with h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae, 2. after acute upper respiratory  tract infections due to viral superinfection, 3. early phase from bacterial replacement by p. aeruginosa, 4. immunocompromised states such as adrenal corticosteroid administration or systemic underlying diseases. these results suggest that the importance of p. aeruginosa in clrti is increasing year by year  and we must pay attention to the fact that p. aeruginosa alone may also cause acute exacerbation in the latter 2 patterns of the condition.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in infants and children in southern taiwan: emphasis on haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  == during a four-year period from november 1988 to october 1992, 41 cases of bacterial meningitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid (csf) culture and/or csf antigen test were collected at the national cheng kung university hospital. the ages of the subjects ranged from 32 days to 13 years, with a median of seven months. the male to female ratio was 2.4:1. the most common causative agent was haemophilus influenzae type b (hib, 29.3%), followed by group b beta-hemolytic streptococci (gbs, 24.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae (22.0%), escherichia coli (4.9%), neisseria meningitidis (4.9%), salmonella species (4.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%), and viridans streptococci (2.6%). the onset of gbs meningitis was always prior to four months of age. of the 41 cases studied, 27 (65.9%) were aged from two months to five years; 12 (44.4%) of these had meningitis caused by hib. most of the cases (90.2%) had a fever as the first clinical manifestation. ampicillin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin was effective against most of the causative pathogens. the most frequently encountered short-term sequelae were seizures (64.7%), subdural effusion (55.9%) and ventriculomegaly (44.1%). observations on  long-term sequelae are ongoing. while the case-fatality rate was as high as 33.3% in s. pneumoniae, and 25% in hib-infected patients, the overall mortality rate was 17.1%. there is a need for greater emphasis on prevention through the use of  available vaccines, including the newly introduced conjugate vaccines against hib which are capable of eliciting immune responses in infants as young as two months.

TI  == [the bactericidal effect of oxybuprocaine. a possible cause of false negative results in bronchoalveolar lavage].
AB  == new approaches in the diagnosis of pneumonia, especially in intensive care units, are quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar (bal) fluid or the protected specimen brush. the sensitivity of these methods, however, has often been found to be as low as 50-60%. one possible explanation for the low sensitivity of these diagnostic tools is the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used in bronchoscopy. therefore, we investigated the bactericidal properties of oxybuprocaine, a topical anaesthetic used for bronchoscopy in our clinic, in order to test the reliability of specimens obtained from bal. methods. the bactericidal activity of oxybuprocaine in concentrations of 1%, 0.1%, 0.05% and 0.01% was tested by constructing time-kill curves for streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. five stains of each bacterial species were tested. the inoculum size was 10(4) ml, and bacteria were counted after 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min. results. the resulting time-kill curves are demonstrated in figs. 1-4. the most sensitive bacteria were  s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae, in which significant bactericidal activity could be shown even with a 0.01% solution of oxybuprocaine. e. coli and p. aeruginosa were also inhibited, but only at the highest concentration of 1%. conclusions. the use of local anaesthetics before material is taken for culture, e.g. from bal, may give rise to false-negative results and should therefore be avoided or reduced. for each local anaesthetic used in bronchoscopy, the concentrations that can be used without the risk of false-negative results should be determined.

TI  == gastric and pharyngeal flora in nosocomial pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation.
AB  == we studied the interrelations between gastric, pharyngeal, proximal, and distal airway bacterial flora in ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) on 36 patients with nosocomial pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation (mv) and 27 mechanically ventilated control subjects without pulmonary infection. gastric, pharyngeal, and endotracheal (ea) sampling for quantitative cultures were performed upon all patients, as well as fiberoptic bronchoscopy with protected specimen brush (psb) sampling. mean bacterial and fungi colony counts were significantly increased in pharyngeal, ea, and psb samples in patients with vap compared with control subjects. the overall increase in colonization was due to gram-positive cocci in all samples. in addition, gram-negative bacilli and fungi  mean counts increased significantly in psb pneumonia samples versus control samples. however, mean gastric colonization was similar in both patients with vap and control subjects. in the former group there was an increase in coincident microorganisms isolated from gastric, pharyngeal, and ea samples in relation to psb samples compared with control samples. among the different quantitative cultures analyzed, only those obtained from ea significantly correlated with psb  cultures in patients with pneumonia (r = 0.67, p = 0.001). in summary, the present study shows that the coincidence between microorganisms isolated in psb cultures and those from gastric and oropharynx increase in mv patients with pneumonia, indicating that both reservoirs play a key role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. conceivably, preventing both gastric and pharyngeal colonization may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. from all the noninvasive samples studied only endotracheal aspirate cultures were useful for inferring the etiology of some vap pneumonias.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

AB  == a 4.5 kb scai chromosomal dna fragment of a clinical isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 was cloned in escherichia coli. combined genetic and molecular analyses have allowed the localization, in a 781 bp ecorv subfragment,  of a gene (cap3-1) directly responsible for the transformation of an unencapsulated, serotype 3 mutant to the capsulated phenotype. comparison of the  deduced amino acid sequence of cap3-1 with the protein sequences compiled in the  data banks revealed that the cap3-1 polypeptide was highly similar to the amino-terminus of the gdp-mannose dehydrogenase of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an enzyme that participates in the synthesis of the mucoid polysaccharide of this species. in addition, the 32 n-terminal amino acids of cap3-1 perfectly matched structures common to nad(+)-binding domains of many dehydrogenases. our results indicate that the 4.5 kb scai fragment might also contain genes common to 13 different pneumococcal serogroups or serotypes tested. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a gene of the capsular complex of s. pneumoniae has been cloned and sequenced. the findings reported here provide new  insights for the study of the molecular biology of the main virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections and might represent a basic step in the identification of cross-reactive antigens that should allow the preparation of new and improved vaccines.

AB  == e-4868, (-)-7-[3-(r)-amino-2-(s)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-(2,4- difluorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with an azetidine moiety at the 7 position. the in vitro activity of e-4868 has been compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin, while the activity of ciprofloxacin was used as reference for in vivo studies. the mics of e-4868 for 90% of the isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.06 to  0.5 microgram/ml against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus spp. in general, the in vitro potency of e-4868 against gram-positive bacteria was higher than those of all of the other fluoroquinolones tested. mic90s against members of the family enterobacteriaceae  between 0.03 and 1 microgram/ml were observed, with the exception of those against serratia marcescens and providencia spp., and a mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml  against pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained. e-4868 inhibited 90% of the clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp. at 2 micrograms/ml and was twofold more active than ciprofloxacin. an increase in the mg2+ concentration from 1 to 10 mm  increased the mic between two and three times. human urine caused a significant decrease in activity of e-4868, which was more pronounced at ph 5.5 than at ph 7.2. the presence of serum also decreased the activity of e-4868. fifty percent effective dose (ed50) values against experimental escherichia coli hm-42 infections in mice were 3.9 mg/kg of body weight with e-4868 and 3.5 mg/kg of body weight with ciprofloxacin. corresponding ed50 values against p. aeruginosa hs-116 were 93.2 and 107.8 mg/kg, respectively, and those against staphylococcus  aureus hs-93 were 6.5 and 44.6 mg/kg, respectively. in experimental infections with streptococcus pneumoniae 84551, the ed50 value of e-4868 was 154.4 mg/kg, while ciprofloxacin proved totally inactive at a dose of 400 mg/kg. when e-4868 was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg in mice, the area under the concentration-time curve (0 to 4 h) value was 28.4 microgram . h/ml, while an area under the concentration-time curve value of 2.3 microgram . h/ml was observed for ciprofloxacin at the same dose. in these studies, levels of the two  agents in blood 1 h postadministration were 7.6 and 1.2 microgram/ml, respectively.

TI  == pre- & post-fumigation bacteriological surveillance of hospital environment.
AB  == study of bacteria in the environment and surfaces of hospital wards revealed klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis, acinetobacter species, coagulase negative staphylococci and serratia marcescens to be the predominant bacterial isolates. surface sampling following fumigation showed significant reduction in most of the isolates. bacterial counts in the air also showed considerable decline. fumigation under proper technical supervision showed significant reduction in bacterial count as compared to that carried out without such supervision. this study highlights that certain bacterial species are predominantly found in the hospital environment and emphasises the need for frequent supervisory monitoring  of hospital wards.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6r, 7r)-7-[[(z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1h-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with  those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. fk-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. of 98 isolates of  homogenous methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of fk-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. the mic of fk-037 for 90% of the strains tested (mic90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci,  streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus bovis. the mic90 for many of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. the mic90 for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. k. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime mics of > 32 micrograms/ml with bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of fk-037 per ml. e. cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and s. aureus stably resistant to fk-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of fk-037. the fk-037 mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. xanthomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter anitratus, and bacteroides species were resistant to fk-037 (mic, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). mbcs were identical to or within twofold of  the mics except for a 32-fold greater mbc for p. aeruginosa. inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of fk-037. fk-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by  2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. nonetheless, fk-037 inhibited bacteria possessing tem-3, -5, and -7 and shv -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. overall, fk-037 has lower mics against staphylococci and p. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae  comparable to that of cefepime.

TI  == infectious diseases that result in slowly resolving and chronic pneumonia.
AB  == familiarity with the natural history of common pneumonias is obligatory for the clinician to determine whether a specific case of pneumonia is resolving at the expected rate. to many clinicians, the term slowly resolving pneumonia conjures an association with underlying neoplasm and/or less common pathogens. in reality, host factors or common pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and legionella  pneumophila are more likely responsible for delayed resolution. familiarity with  the pattern of resolution of pneumonias caused by these organisms should allow the clinician to follow such patients and avoid premature invasive evaluation. in contrast, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia species rarely result in slowly resolving pneumonia. chronic bacterial pneumonia is an infectious syndrome that may present in the absence of systemic symptoms. the presentation is varied and may mimic neoplasm, interstitial lung disease, or chronic fungal or mycobacterial infection. bacteria most commonly associated with chronic pneumonia include haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci (not  s pneumoniae), and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == characterization of pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot.
AB  == immunological characterization of various pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by sds-page and western blot using sera from infected humans and  from patients with other bacterial infections. somatic (som) and partially purified cell extracts (pce) gave more complex sds-page patterns: m(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kda, respectively. the culture-filtrated antigens (cf) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands m(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kda. pce and cf reacted specifically with infected human sera; som did not. the components with m(r) of 40 kda in cf reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. stutzeri. this peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in cf thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is an oxime-type cephem antibiotic with a  1-hydroxyethyl-5-amino-pyrazole moiety at the 3 position. fk037 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, fk037 was twofold or more  active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic for 90% of the strains [mic90] = 32 micrograms/ml), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 micrograms/ml), group a  streptococci (mic90 = 0.015 microgram/ml), and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). in addition, the activity of fk037 was equal to or greater than that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone against streptococcus pneumoniae  (mic90 = 0.12 microgram/ml) and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). fk037 was more active in vitro than cefepime (two- to fourfold) and cefpirome (twofold) against s. aureus. in murine systemic infection models, fk037 showed potent activity against p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant s. aureus. fk037 was also efficacious in a mouse model of pyelonephritis caused by s. aureus or klebsiella pneumoniae and in a mouse model  of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by s. pneumoniae. additional studies on this compound to assess its potential clinical utility are warranted.

TI  == immunodiagnosis of group-a streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  == etiology and pathology of equine placentitis.
AB  == placentas from aborted, stillborn, and premature foals were examined during the 1988 and 1989 foaling seasons, and 236 of 954 (24.7%) had placentitis. microorganisms associated with placentitis were isolated or demonstrated from 162 of 236 (68.6%) placentitis cases. leptospira spp. and a nocardioform actinomycete were 2 important, newly emerging bacteria associated with equine placentitis. major pathogens identified in decreasing order were streptococcus zooepidemicus,  leptospira spp., escherichia coli, a nocardioform actinomycete, fungi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus equisimilis, enterobacter agglomerans, klebsiella pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus. pathogens were not recovered in 64 cases (27.1%) and overgrowth by saprophytic bacteria was recorded in 10 cases (4.2%). twenty-seven cases (16.6%) had mixed bacterial growth and 93  cases (57.4%) had bacteria cultured from both placenta and fetal organs. the majority of the placentitis cases caused by bacteria, with the exception of leptospira spp. and the nocardioform actinomycete, occurred in 2 forms. one was acute, focal or diffuse; had an infiltration of neutrophils in the intervillous spaces or necrosis of chorionic villi; was associated with bacteremia; and frequently occurred in the placenta from fetuses expelled before or at midgestation. the other was observed from foals expelled at late gestation, was mostly chronic and focal or focally extensive, and occurred mostly at the cervical star area. chronic placentitis was characterized by the presence of 1 or a combination of the following lesions: necrosis of chorionic villi, presence of  eosinophilic amorphous material on the chorion, and infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells in the intervillous spaces, villous stroma, chorionic stroma,  vascular layer, and allantois.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections.
AB  == an open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy  and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary  pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. the combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). the control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h; amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h; or kinetically dosed tobramycin plus ticarcillin, 3 gm to  4 gm q4h. the two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and clinical  characteristics. among the 84 patients, organisms from the enterobacteriaceae family accounted for the largest proportion of isolates (44%) including escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella species (14%), and serratia species (9%). other commonly identified organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), haemophilus influenzae (15%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and staphylococcus  aureus (8%). results of this trial included clinical response rates of 83% in both groups (p = 0.951) and a microbiologic cure rate of 75% in the aztreonam group and 63% in the control group (p = 0.291). in the 59 patients with documented aerobic gram-negative pneumonia, microbiologic eradication rates were  72% in the aztreonam group versus 57% in the control group (p = 0.359). duration  of treatment tended to be shorter in the aztreonam group than in the control group, with a median 10 days of therapy versus 12 days of therapy (p = 0.095), respectively. in addition, the percentage of patients requiring nonstudy antimicrobial agents tended to be lower in the aztreonam group than the control group, involving 21% of patients in the aztreonam group compared with 36% of patients in the control group (p = 0.086). all regimens were well tolerated, and  no patient was withdrawn because of adverse reactions to the study medications. two patients, both in the control group, required dose reduction, which was necessitated by possible aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. this trial shows  that aztreonam is an effective agent with an excellent safety profile when used in combination regimens for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. a well-controlled trial is needed to verify the trend toward shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for additional antimicrobial agents seen with the aztreonam regimen when compared with those receiving aminoglycoside-combination regimens.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == fk037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. in murine systemic infections, fk037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa). it was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae, except serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except mrsa and p. aeruginosa against which fk037 was more  effective than cefpirome. these results correlated well with its in vitro activity. in murine local infections, with few exceptions, fk037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against klebsiella pneumonia in ed50 values and against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with staphylococcus epidermidis, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with s. aureus and e. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. it is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of fk037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its  in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and p. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. in addition, the therapeutic effects of fk037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to mssa, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for mssa, 0.063 to 0.125 g for k. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for p. aeruginosa). fk037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect  (pae) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with mssa in neutropenic mice. these results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == enap-2, a novel cysteine-rich bactericidal peptide from equine leukocytes.
AB  == we purified a novel cysteine-rich antibiotic peptide, enap-2 (m(r), approximately 6,500), from acid extracts of equine neutrophils by sequential gel filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determined its partial  n-terminal amino acid sequence. although its cysteine motif distinguished enap-2  from all other currently known endogenous antibiotic peptides, including defensins and granulins, it showed substantial sequence similarity to wdnm1, a putative member of the four-disulfide-core protein family that also includes animal and human antiproteases, snake venom neurotoxins, and rat and mouse whey proteins. the antibacterial properties of enap-2 were tested against several equine uterine pathogens, namely, streptococcus zooepidemicus, escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. killing of s. zooepidemicus was very efficient, as evidenced by a 94% decrease in numbers of cfu per milliliter after exposure to 100 micrograms of enap-2 per ml (approximately 15 microm) for 2 h. exposure of e. coli and p. aeruginosa to 200 micrograms of enap-2 per ml for 2 h resulted in 90.2 and 77.6% reduction, respectively, in the  numbers of cfu per milliliter. bacteriostasis, without bactericidal activity, occurred after k. pneumoniae was incubated with 200 micrograms of enap-2 per ml.  additional studies will be required in other species and cell types to determine  whether enap-2 is restricted to equine neutrophils or is the index member of a larger family of endogenous antibiotics.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == early mucosal changes in experimental sinusitis.
AB  == normal mucociliary flow is a significant defense mechanism in the prevention of acute sinusitis. we have undertaken a study to examine the early sinus mucosal and mucociliary changes that occur in response to acute infection. twenty rabbits were evaluated for 5 days after an obstructed maxillary sinus was inoculated with either streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or a sterile saline solution. data collected included measurements of sinus mucosal ciliary beat frequency, quantitation of ciliated cell losses, and electron microscopic observations. results demonstrate statistically significant  (p < 0.05) changes in mucosal ciliary beat frequency that were either excitatory  or inhibitory, depending both on the length of the infection and the specific organism. no changes in ciliary beat frequency were observed in the control animals (p > 0.55). control animals likewise demonstrated no loss of ciliated cells from mucosal epithelium; however, dramatic losses of ciliated cells from the sinus mucosa of the experimental groups were observed. these losses occurred  at different rates, depending on the infecting organism, but all infected groups  demonstrated a > 86% decrease in the number of viable ciliated cells from the sinus mucosa after sinusitis of 5 days duration. we conclude that a significant loss of ciliated cells from sinus mucosa and a corresponding disruption of normal mucociliary flow occurs early after exposure to pathogenic organisms and is a significant predisposing factor in the development of acute sinusitis.

TI  == optimum use of selective plated media in primary processing of respiratory tract  specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == a total of 258 respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis were inoculated onto nine different plated media, and the rates of recovery of potential pathogens were compared. media included sheep blood agar, enriched chocolate agar, macconkey agar for gram-negative bacilli, chocolate agar containing bacitracin for haemophilus spp., bromcresol green agar for yeasts, cetrimide agar for pseudomonas spp., sheep blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid for gram-positive cocci, mannitol salt agar for staphylococcus aureus, and oxidation-fermentation agar containing 300 u of polymyxin b per ml and 2 u of bacitracin per ml (of-pbl medium) for pseudomonas cepacia. with two exceptions, all of these media proved useful in recovering potential pathogens from respiratory tract specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis. the two exceptions were cetrimide agar and colistin-nalidixic acid-supplemented sheep blood agar, which were found to be superfluous. in addition, the results of this  study further delineated the prevalence of selected bacteria and fungi in respiratory tract secretions from patients with cystic fibrosis. in rank order of frequency of isolation, we recovered isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, candida albicans, s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae,  molds, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, yeasts other than candida albicans, miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, p. cepacia, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == recurrence of microbial keratitis concomitant with antiinflammatory treatment in  an animal model.
AB  == recurrence of pseudomonas keratitis during treatment with corticosteroids has been reported previously in humans. rabbits with keratitis due to pseudomonas aeruginosa or streptococcus pneumoniae were treated with antibiotics and either vehicle, methylprednisolone acetate, flurbiprofen, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (ndga). cultures performed after 7 days were negative, and antibiotics were discontinued. two weeks later, pseudomonas keratitis recurred in 6 of 7 (85.7%) steroid-treated rabbits, 1 of 8 (12.5%) flurbiprofen-treated rabbits, 1 of 8 (12.5%) ndga-treated rabbits, and none of 8 vehicle-treated rabbits. none of the  31 rabbits infected with streptococcus pneumoniae experienced recurrence. these data confirm the clinical observation that pseudomonas keratitis may recur if antibiotic therapy is discontinued and corticosteroids are administered; the risk of recurrence appears to be much less with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.

TI  == identification of enap-1, an antimicrobial peptide from equine neutrophils.
AB  == endogenous, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides known as defensins are prominent components of human, rabbit, and rat neutrophils, yet little is known about their occurrence in other mammalian species. although we did not detect mature (i.e., processed) defensins in equine neutrophil granules, we found that these granules  contained small amounts of other cysteine-rich peptides with antimicrobial activity. one of these, enap-1, was purified by a combination of gel permeation and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography from acid extracts prepared from the cytoplasmic granules of equine neutrophils. the molecular mass  of enap-1 was approximately 7.2 kda, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. amino acid analysis revealed that enap-1 had an unusually high cysteine content and that it was relatively enriched in alanine, glycine, lysine, and proline residues. the partial (n-terminal) amino acid sequence of enap-1 was dvqcgeghfchdxqtccrasqggxaccpysqgvccadqrhccpvgf. thirty-six of these residues (78.3%) were identical to those of a recently cloned human neutrophil peptide of  unknown function and belonging to the granulin family. homologous peptides have also been noted in rat bone marrow cells and rat kidney epithelins. we tested the ability of enap-1 to kill several equine uterine pathogens. streptococcus zooepidemicus was killed most effectively, sustaining a greater than 99.8% decrease in cfu per milliliter after a 2-h exposure to 100 micrograms of enap-1 per ml (approximately 15 microm). escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were somewhat less susceptible, manifesting 87.0 and 87.1% mean decreases in cfu  per milliliter, respectively, after incubation for 2 h with 200 micrograms of enap-1 per ml. klebsiella pneumoniae numbers were not significantly reduced after exposure to enap-1. these antimicrobial properties suggest that enap-1 may contribute to phagocyte-mediated host defense against equine infections.

AB  == rp 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of rp 57669 and rp 54476. the activity of rp 59500 and its two components against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. rp 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal  to 1 mg/l (range 0.06-2 mg/l). both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of s. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and  ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group c and g streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the mic90 was 4 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59500 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of rp 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were bacteroides spp. rp 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. mbcs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, compared with mbcs in broth, but rp 59500  was as active at ph 6 as at ph 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. rp 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == du-6859, (-)-7-[(7s)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1r,2r)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. the mics for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (mic90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. mic50s of du-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those  of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. du-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml,  respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. although the activity of du-6859 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the mic50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the mic90 level. du-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. strains of bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to du-6859; mic90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. du-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the action of du-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the mics. du-6859 activity was not affected by different media, ph, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.

TI  == safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin versus cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == in two multicenter trials, lomefloxacin and cefaclor were compared as treatments  for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. in total, 522 adult outpatients were enrolled at 50 centers in the united states. patients were randomized to treatment groups receiving either 400 mg lomefloxacin orally once daily (n = 259) or 250 mg cefaclor every 8 hours (n = 263) for 7-10 days. both groups were comparable in terms of age, severity of exacerbation, smoking history, theophylline use, and baseline pathogens. the most common baseline pathogens were haemophilus influenzae, found in 32% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and in 29% in the cefaclor group, pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%  and 16%, respectively), moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (12% and 13%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (10% in both groups). bacterial eradication rates 1-4 days after the completion of treatment for all patients with baseline pathogens were 81.8% in the lomefloxacin group and 62.7% in the cefaclor group (p less than 0.001). clinical success (disappearance or improvement of presenting signs and symptoms) was noted in 80.0% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and 64.7% in the cefaclor group (p = 0.002). eradication rates for the subgroup of patients who had pathogens susceptible in vitro to both study drugs and who completed treatment were 97.1% for lomefloxacin and 84.6% for cefaclor (p = 0.002). clinical success rates in this subgroup were 92.4% for lomefloxacin and 90.1 for  cefaclor (p = 0.585). treatment-related adverse events were reported for 7% of patients in the lomefloxacin group and 5% in the cefaclor group. the most common  adverse events in both groups were nausea and diarrhea. six patients were withdrawn from treatment with lomefloxacin and four from the cefaclor group because of adverse events. there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of theophylline interaction with either treatment. once-daily oral administration of 400 mg lomefloxacin was an effective, well-tolerated alternative to 250 mg of cefaclor three times daily in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

TI  == animal models as predictors of outcome of therapy with broad spectrum cephalosporins.
AB  == broad spectrum cephalosporins have been studied extensively in animal models of experimental infections. there is generally good correlation between the results  of therapy of experimental infections and clinical trials in humans. however, the results of animal model studies are better predictors of the failure than of the  success of a chemotherapeutic regimen. cefotaxime and the new 'fourth' generation agent, cefpirome, were comparable in the treatment of experimental meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. cefpirome was the most effective cephalosporin as therapy for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus experimental endocarditis. the most effective broad spectrum cephalosporins for the treatment of gram-negative experimental pneumonia were cefpirome, cefotaxime  and cefodizime. cefpirome was equivalent to ceftazidime or cefazolin as treatment for pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-susceptible s. aureus experimental osteomyelitis. because of its potent activity in vitro and in animal models of experimental infections caused by methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and gram-negative bacilli, cefpirome may offer a therapeutic advantage over currently available broad spectrum cephalosporins.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (l-ofloxacin), an optically active ofloxacin.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. in general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against  staphylococcus aureus, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter, proteus, providencia, salmonella, and yersinia spp.; and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both compounds were equally active against pseudomonas cepacia. the in vitro dna gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an e. coli enzyme. in vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin  in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. this study presents some potential advantages of the pure l isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of opc-17116 were compared with those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, and tosufloxacin. the mics of opc-17116 for 90% of the strains tested were 0.125 to 8 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria such as members of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus: less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml  against members of the family enterobacteriaceae; and less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml against glucose-nonfermentative bacilli such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of opc-17116 against gram-positive organisms was comparable to that of tosufloxacin and higher than those of other reference drugs. the in vitro activity of opc-17116 against gram-negative bacteria was similar to those of the reference drugs. in experimental systemic infections in mice with various organisms, the efficacy of opc-17116 was similar to that of tosufloxacin and greater than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. in a pyelonephritic model in mice with p. aeruginosa ku-1, opc-17116 was as active as ciprofloxacin and more active than ofloxacin, enoxacin, and tosufloxacin. in respiratory tract infections in mice with staphylococcus aureus smith, streptococcus pneumoniae tms 3, and klebsiella pneumoniae 3k25, the efficacy of opc-17116 was generally greater than that of tosufloxacin. the peak level of opc-17116 in the lungs of mice was 10 times higher than that in serum and was significantly greater than levels in lung achieved with an equivalent dose of the other quinolones. the therapeutic efficacy of opc-17116 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its high concentration in tissue.

TI  == in vitro activity of sparfloxacin compared with those of five other quinolones.
AB  == the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 857 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and lomefloxacin. the mic of sparfloxacin for 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested was 0.5 microgram/ml (range, 0.06 to 4.0 micrograms/ml); only for members of the genera serratia, citrobacter, and providencia were mics above 1 microgram/ml. some 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 8 micrograms of the drug per ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus spp. and enterococcus faecalis were 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. all (100%) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. the inoculum size had little effect on either the mic or the mbc of sparfloxacin. an increase in the magnesium concentration from 1.1 to 8.4 mm increased the mic between 2 and 10 times, depending on the genus tested. sparfloxacin was less active at ph 5. the antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin  against gram-positive bacteria was generally higher than those of the quinolones  with which it was compared; against streptococcus pneumoniae, sparfloxacin was four- and eightfold more active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the activity of sparfloxacin against gram-negative rods was generally comparable  to that of ciprofloxacin except against enterobacter and acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas cepacia, xanthomonas maltophilia, and alcaligenes and flavobacterium  spp., against which sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone.

TI  == [a clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (cs-976, papm/bp), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical  efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. the duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. when clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. it was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. it was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. papm/bp was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses  daily to 10 cases. for the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. the efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. the overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. as pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. they were gram-positive cocci including 2  strains each of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus viridans  and a strain of streptococcus spp., and gram-negative rods including 9 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas spp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1.  its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in  vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects  were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, l-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the attainable inhibitory ratios (ar) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amx/ca), ofloxacin (ofl), l-ofloxacin (l-ofl), cefuroxime (cefu), ciprofloxacin (cip), and enoxacin (eno), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. ar of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the mics achieved at the respiratory  site. bacteria tested included staphylococcus aureus, group-a and group-b streptococci, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, brahamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae,  h. parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella pneumophila. the antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against gram-positive cocci. ofloxacin and l-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ars against respiratory pathogen, including,  l. pneumophila, h. influenzae, and b. catarrhalis. all agents showed no, or inadequately low ars for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [the effect of biomaterials and other industrial materials on the growth of several aerobic bacterial species in vitro].
AB  == the article deals with interactions between bio-vitro-materials and bacteria species in vitro. the growth of s. aureus, sc. salivarius, e. coli and ps. aeruginosa in a salt solution with and without addition of biomaterials was examined until the day 60 in a static culture. by counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. the data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. we found, that ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. the same can be said about the last materials and e. coli. in contrast as well ca- and p-containing as--free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. changes  of multiplying of s. aureus and sc. salivarius seldom were observed. it ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. this may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. it is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. materials with indifferent behavior or low anti-microbiological effect have to be favoured.

TI  == controlled comparison of the bact/alert and bactec 660/730 nonradiometric blood culture systems.
AB  == in a collaborative study at three university hospitals, the recovery of microorganisms and the speed of detection of microbial growth by the bact/alert (organon teknika corporation, durham, n.c.) and bactec 660/730 (becton-dickinson  diagnostic instrument systems, sparks, md.) nonradiometric blood culture systems  were compared. a total of 5,918 comparisons were made between bact/alert aerobic  and bactec nr 6a bottles and 5,992 comparisons were made between bact/alert anaerobic and bactec nr 7a bottles. each bottle was inoculated with 5 ml of blood. the overall recoveries of microorganisms from the two aerobic bottles were comparable; members of the family enterobacteriaceae were recovered more often from bact/alert aerobic bottles alone (p less than 0.001). the overall recoveries of microorganisms from the anaerobic bottles were not significantly different. growth of staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than 0.01), streptococci (p less than 0.001), escherichia coli (p less than 0.01), other members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.02), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.05) was detected earlier in bact/alert aerobic bottles. growth of s. aureus (p less than 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than 0.05), enterococci (p less than 0.01), streptococcus pneumoniae (p less than 0.02), viridans group streptococci (p less than 0.05), e. coli (p less than 0.001), klebsiella pneumoniae (p less than 0.01), and other members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001) was detected earlier in bact/alert anaerobic bottles. in a system-versus-system comparison, more gram-positive cocci were recovered from the bactec system alone (p < 0.05), and more members or the family enterobacteriaceae were recovered from the bact/alert system alone (p < 0.001). as a system, the bact/alert system detected growth of s. aureus (p < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.01), streptococci (p < 0.001), e. coli (p < 0.001), other members of the familyenterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001), and p. aeruginosa (p < 0.05) earlier than the bactec system did. significantly fewer (40 versus 1,183) false-positive results occurred with the bact/alert system. we conclude that the  bact/alert and bactec 660/730 nonradiometric systems are comparable for recovering clinically significant microorganisms form adult patients with bacteremia or fungemia, but that the bact/alert system detects microbial growth earlier than the bactec system does, with significantly fewer false-positive results.

TI  == [respiratory tract infections in the elderly, advances and limitations in the diagnosis and treatment].
AB  == advances and limitations in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory tract infections were discussed in relation to the prognosis of the elderly patients. haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae are the major pathogens in the community-acquired respiratory tract infections. on the other hand, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the major pathogens in the nosocomial respiratory tract infections. detection of  mrsa-pbp genes and antibiotic sensitivity tests are important for the diagnosis of mrsa. vancomycin or arbekacin is the first-choice antibiotic for the treatment of severe infection caused by mrsa, and a combination therapy using one of the above agents and a partner antibiotic is necessary in some cases of mrsa infections. reports concerning the significance of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in japan have been rare, presumably because procedures to recover anaerobic bacteria from specimens other than sputum, for example transtrancheal aspiration (tta), bronchoscopic procedure and transcutaneous lung biopsy, are required for the diagnosis of the anaerobic respiratory tract infections. nowadays, identification of cytomegalovirus (cmv) is a prerequisit for the rapid diagnosis of cmv infection. therefore attempts are being made to detect a specific substance, for example messenger rna during the stage of reactivation of cmv. prophylaxis as well as treatment is necessary for the control of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections. in this regard, long-term administration of a small dose of erythromycin or new-quinolone is promising.

TI  == effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  == in vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (nhu). primary cultures of nhu cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in f-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (fcs). optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of nhu cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in f-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% bpe) and 0.05% bsa. results indicated that insulin in the f-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less igf-1. further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that pge1 is growth stimulatory and can replace bpe as a growth factor requirement. this finding was in agreement with the fact that bpe growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl camp. these results suggested that both bpe and cholera toxin operated by activation of a camp-dependent mitogenic pathway. seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (lt) were tested for their effects on nhu clonal growth. three out of the five lps derived from escherichia coli (strains 055:b5, 0128:b12, and 0127:b8), lps from klebsiella pneumoniae, and lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. lps derived from e. coli strain (0111:b4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). in contrast, lt  derived from streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureas, and bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [lt] less than 50 micrograms/ml. lt from strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. the growth inhibitory effects of lps were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that lps effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. we speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by lps produced by gram-negative bacteria. however, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. the growth-stimulating activity of lts produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due  to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.

TI  == intranasal immunization with bacterial polysaccharide containing liposomes enhances antigen-specific pulmonary secretory antibody response.
AB  == enhancement of bacterial antigen-specific secretory iga (siga) titres in the lungs may enhance resistance to infections, such as pneumonia, occurring at this  mucosal surface. to examine this issue, we intranasally administered liposomes containing bacterial polysaccharide antigens from aerobacter levanicum, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae. in each case, increased titres of bacterial polysaccharide-specific siga could be achieved in the lungs following intranasal immunization with antigen encapsulated in liposomes. in comparison with oral immunization, which required high doses of polysaccharide antigen even when coadministered with adjuvant, intranasal administration of liposomes containing polysaccharide antigens achieved a similar pulmonary siga response with approximately 1/30 the amount of antigen necessary with oral immunization. in the case of p. aeruginosa, the magnitude of the siga response following intranasal immunization was sufficient to significantly reduce mortality from pneumonia produced by this organism. these results demonstrate that liposome-based mucosal immunization strategies can induce increased bacterial polysaccharide antigen-specific siga titres in the lung, and reduce susceptibility to pneumonia.

AB  == infections of the respiratory airways are frequently responsible for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and attacks of asthma. however, the causal infectious agents in practice are rarely precisely identified. we have undertaken a prospective study with the aim of researching into the bacteria and viruses associated with these exacerbations. forty-seven patients who were in hospital between 1987 and 1989 for attacks of asthma (13 episodes) or exacerbations of copd (35 episodes) were included in this study. the microbiological analysis consisted of: 1) the bacteriology of expectorated material or the products aspirated by fibroscopy with direct examination, quantitative cytology and culture; 2) samples taken from the nasal airways to identify and isolate pneumotropic viruses and mycoplasma; 3) serial serology looking for antibodies against pneumotropic bacteria and viruses. one of more infectious agents were shown in 47% of the episode studies of which 57% were exacerbations of copd and treated 23% attacks of asthma. in the cases copd bacteria were identified in 13 cases including haemophilus influenzae [3], streptococcus pneumoniae [3], pseudomonas aeruginosa [3]. amongst the 14 viruses  recovered, the influenza virus [8] and the respiratory syncytial virus (vrs) [4]  predominated. in 14 cases of acute asthma only 4 infectious agents were shown; mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza a, vrs and parainfluenza virus. the influenza virus was the agent most frequently discovered (26%) during the course of exacerbation of copd and of asthma.

TI  == comparative efficacy of contact lens disinfection solutions.
AB  == using the d value method of analysis, we evaluated the relative antimicrobial effectiveness of eight contact lens disinfection solutions against a standard population of challenge organisms as defined in the microbiological guidelines proposed by the food and drug administration (fda). six bacteria (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens) and two fungi (aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans) were investigated. the disinfectants included hydrogen peroxide (aosept, mirasept, oxysept), chlorine-based solutions (aerotab  and softab), soaking solutions containing synthetic, high molecular weight preservatives (renu and opti-free) and a thimerosal preserved soaking solution (hydrocare cleaning and soaking solution). the one-step hydrogen peroxide system  (aosept) was evaluated both with and without the catalytic disk. to facilitate comparison of the disinfecting solutions, we defined a new measure of performance, namely "power" of solution. this has an advantage over the "safety factor" because the solution power is independent of the size of the initial inoculum. because different approaches to analysis may yield a wide range of d values for one set of survival data we call for adoption of a standardized approach. our results suggest that one of the chlorine-based solutions fails to meet the fda recommendations for bacterial challenge. most solutions performed poorly against mycotic challenge. however, when used over longer disinfecting periods, 3% hydrogen peroxide and the hydrocare solution gave adequate performance against fungi.

TI  == a randomized trial of cefepime (bmy-28142) and ceftazidime for the treatment of pneumonia.
AB  == cefepime is a new cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. to study the efficacy and safety of cefepime for treatment of pneumonia, 65 patients were randomized to therapy with either cefepime or ceftazidime at a two to one ratio. of the 57 evaluable patients, 89% of the cefepime patients and 84% of the ceftazidime patients were cured clinically or improved. haemophilus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria spp. were common pathogens. bacteriological cure was achieved in 31 (91%) of cefepime patients and 17 (100%) ceftazidime patients. adverse clinical and laboratory reactions possibly due to study drug occurred in  9 (21%) cefepime patients and in 1 (5%) ceftazidime patient. most reactions were  mild and resolved with discontinuation of study drug. in this study, cefepime appeared as effective as ceftazidime for the treatment of pneumonia.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of different beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated. a postantibiotic effect (pae) was induced for different bacterial species by exposure to 10x mic of several beta-lactam antibiotics for 2 h in vitro. the antibiotic-bacterial combinations used in this study were imipenem-pseudomonas aeruginosa, benzylpenicillin-streptococcus pneumoniae and -streptococcus pyogenes, cefcanel-s. pyogenes, ampicillin-escherichia coli, and piperacillin-e. coli. after the induction of the pae, the exposed cultures as well as the unexposed controls were washed and diluted. thereafter, the cultures in the postantibiotic  phase (pa phase) and the cultures not previously treated with antibiotics were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x mic of the relevant drug and the growth curves were compared. when bacteria in the pa phase were exposed to sub-mics, a substantial prolongation of the time before regrowth was demonstrated, especially in antibiotic-bacterial combinations for which a pae was found. in contrast, sub-mics on cultures not previously exposed to suprainhibitory antibiotic concentrations yielded only a slight reduction in growth rate compared with the controls. thus, it seems important to distinguish the direct effects of sub-mics  on bacteria not previously exposed to suprainhibitory concentrations from the effects of sub-mics on bacteria in the pa phase.

TI  == [microbiological care of ventilated intensive care patients. feasibility of diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary infection].
AB  == pulmonary infections are the most life-threatening infections in mechanically ventilated patients. methods to avoid these infections by prophylactic systemic or local administration of antibiotics may promote resistance and selection of distinct groups of pathogens. in mechanically ventilated patients we studied the  impact of early diagnosis and specific therapy on the prevention of pulmonary infections. due to the very short interval between colonization and infection, daily microscopic and microbiologic examinations of tracheobronchial secretions proved to be essential for early and successful therapy and even prevention of pulmonary infections. patients and methods. the present study comprised a total of 190 patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit who required mechanical ventilation for a period of at least 48 h: 56 were admitted for multiple trauma; 38 had peritonitis; and the remainder had postoperative complications such as renal failure, cardiac problems, septicemia or pneumonia. multitraumatized patients (16.5 days) and those with peritonitis (13.8 days) needed the most extensive ventilatory support. after admission antibiotic therapy was started with a second-generation cephalosporin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. further antibiotic treatment was directed strictly against the isolated pathogens. tracheobronchial secretions were monitored daily by microscopy and cultures. microscopic evaluation was essential to discriminate between colonization and inflammation, and often indicated the infective agent. if infections were suspected provisional antibiograms were performed on the material. this procedure allowed a specific antibiotic treatment to be initiated  8-12 h later. in patients with pulmonary infections, additional bronchoscopic material was taken in order to correlate these findings with those gained from the tracheobronchial secretions. results. in 85% of cases massive colonization of the trachea with pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteria, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae resulted in pulmonary infections 24-48 h later. the reduced virulence of pseudomonas species (non-aeruginosa) and acinetobacter species is reflected by an infection rate of 50% and an extended period of time to establish an infection (2-4 days). only 30% of patients highly contaminated with candida developed pulmonary infections after 3-6 days. a fair correlation (86%) was found between pathogens isolated in tracheobronchial secretions and bronchoscopic material. in the population studied, 68 patients (35.7%) developed  pulmonary infections, 32 of them pneumonia (16.8%), and the others purulent tracheobronchitis with fever. both groups were treated with antibiotics. patients with multiple trauma, often accompanied by lung contusion, were most frequently affected. in 59 patients (87%) pulmonary infections were treated successfully by  specific antibiotic therapy; 9 patients died so rapidly, that the pulmonary complication could not account for the fatal outcome. in 38 patients with massive contamination of the tracheobronchial system by enterobacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa or staph. aureus, progression from colonization to infection was prevented by early administration of specific therapy. conclusions. because pulmonary infections in most cases arise very soon after pathogens have gained access to the tracheobronchial system daily monitoring of tracheobronchial secretions is required for early initiation of specific therapy.

TI  == dual-action cephalosporins: cephalosporin 3'-quinolone carbamates.
AB  == a series of cephalosporins has been prepared in which the 3'-position was linked  to the nitrogen of the antibacterial quinolone ciprofloxacin through a carbamate  function. like the ester-linked and quaternary-linked dual-action cephalosporins  reported earlier, these carbamate-linked compounds exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum derived from both cephalosporin-like and quinolone-like activities, suggesting a dual mode of action. studies to elucidate details of the mechanism of action have been inconclusive. ciprofloxacin liberated as a consequence of bacterial enzyme-mediated reactions may contribute to the second mode of action, although some evidence indicates that the intact carbamate-linked bifunctional molecules may possess intrinsically both beta-lactam and quinolone activities.

AB  == two hundred sudanese children (105 males, 95 females) with otitis media (om) were studied. their age range was from 3 months to 15 years, with 41.5% being below 2  years of age. the presenting symptoms included ear discharge in 96% and pyrexia in 26.5% of patients. ear ache and itching were reported in 22.5% and 7.0% respectively and impaired hearing in 7.0%. bacterial pathogens were isolated from 115 (70.1%) of 164 cultures from children with chronic discharging ears. organisms isolated in order of frequency were: proteus species, klebsiella with other coliforms, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. sixty of 84 (71.4%) cultures from children with acute om grew pathogenic bacteria. staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella with other coliforms were the commonest pathogens. proteus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less frequent but beta-haemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli were the least common. antibiotic sensitivity results show that  the majority of isolates from children with discharging ears were sensitive to gentamicin, followed by co-trimoxazole and streptomycin. the majority of organisms showed poor sensitivity to ampicillin and penicillin. the results of this study show that cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for treating children with om.

AB  == the major pathogens causing acute otitis media (aom) are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, with moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. the same organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. in chronic suppurative otitis media, pseudomonas aeruginosa and s aureus are most frequently found. antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating aom are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. currently, about 20% of aom cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually h influenzae or m catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in aom  than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.

(ii) chromosomal penicillinase producing species: k. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and k. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (iii) chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: e. cloacae and c. freundii 1-  greater than 128: s. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + proteus 0.06-0.12. activity of cbt was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, cbt was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. cbt was inactive on p. aeruginosa (mic greater than or equal to 32) and  on a. baumannii (8- greater than 128). haemophilus and gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to cbt (mic 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for meningococci; b. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin g) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin g). cbt was inactive on staphylococci. enterococci and streptococci b were generally resistant; streptococci a, c, g were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (mic 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas mic for other streptococci 0.12 to 128 (mic 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). these antibacterial properties particularly against enterobacteriaceae placed cbt in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.

TI  == [combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  == it has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (azt) and  clindamycin (cldm) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. we, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. azt and cldm in combination had synergistic effects on staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to cldm, in the presence of cldm at mic or sub-mic. 2. for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are  not sensitive to cldm, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of cldm at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. the 2 drugs showed no antagonism.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

AB  == the medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, haemophilus influenzae type b, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and eikenella corrodens. no organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. a thickened pleural "peel," scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural ph and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. a scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. in patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (p less than 0.001).

TI  == bacteremia during diarrhea: incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome.
AB  == to determine the importance of bacteremia in hospitalized patients with diarrhea  in bangladesh, from september 1982 through august 1983 the authors obtained blood for culture from 1,824 patients who were suspected of having sepsis (44% of all admissions). nontyphoid bacteremia occurred in 243 patients. the most common pathogens were the enterobacteriaceae (n = 66 episodes), staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-glucose-fermenting bacilli (n = 50),  streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 40), and haemophilus influenzae (n = 16). when compared with an equal number of control patients without bacteremia, bacteremic  patients were significantly (p less than 0.05) more likely to be under 1 year of  age (46.5% of bacteremic patients vs. 30.0% of control patients) and more often had abdominal tenderness (20.1% vs. 11.5%), hypoproteinemia (a serum protein level less than 60 g/liter) (58.9% vs. 42.9%), and a prior intravenous infusion (49.0% vs. 30.9%). the case-fatality rate was 29.7% in bacteremic patients versus 7.8% in controls (relative risk (rr) = 3.8, p less than 0.001). factors that were associated with an increased risk of death in bacteremic patients were infection  with a gram-negative pathogen (rr = 2.48), decreased peristalsis (rr = 2.66), hypoproteinemia (rr = 3.36), hypothermia (rr = 2.54), and hypotension (rr = 2.19). bacteremia appears to be an important link between diarrheal illness and death in bangladesh. in children with diarrhea who are suspected of being septic, early implementation of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against the broad range of pathogens identified appears to be indicated.

AB  == efficacy of cefoperazone versus cefoperazone plus sulbactam was studied in a rabbit neutropenic site infection model against a broad range of clinical isolates including six isolates each of staphylococci, enterococci, pneumococci,  enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapy of cefoperazone plus sulbactam demonstrated enhanced efficacy against the staphylococci, pseudomonads, and enterobacteriaceae. the activity of cefoperazone against enterococci and pneumococci was not enhanced or inhibited by the addition of sulbactam. increased concentrations of cefoperazone found at the infection sites when sulbactam was added to the therapeutic regimen indicates that sulbactam provided a protection to cefoperazone from beta-lactamases produced by staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae. the combination improved the efficacy of cefoperazone in this animal model.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == microbial-host interactions in the airways in chronic respiratory infection.
AB  == the pathogenic events that take place in chronic respiratory infection highlight  the successful microbial strategy of survival by persistence, or colonization. microorganisms implement their strategy of persistence by two principal tactics:  (1) sabotage of the host's bronchial defenses (ie, direct microbe-mediated damage to the host), and (2) subversion of the host's normally protective defenses into  damaging host tissue itself (ie, indirect host-mediated damage provoked by the microbe). among the various ways in which microorganisms directly damage host defenses and facilitate their own persistence in the respiratory tract are inhibition of ciliary function, inhibition of mucociliary transport, alteration of ion transport in respiratory epithelium, stimulation of mucus production, and  damage to respiratory epithelium. patients with chronic respiratory infection suffer a vicious circle of events leading to progressive lung damage and cardio-respiratory failure. treatments to break this circle include antimicrobial therapy to reduce microbial colonization and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive  therapy to modulate damaging host responses.

TI  == [comparative study of nosocomial and community acquired lower respiratory tract infections. a prospective study of 232 cases].
AB  == quantitative sputum culture, single catheter protected specimen brush, blood culture, culture of pleural and other body fluid were used in a prospective study of 232 cases of lower respiratory tract infection. 123 cases of nosocomial infection (group 1) and 109 cases of community acquired infection (group 2) were  analyzed comparatively. significant underlying diseases were present in 100% of group 1 and 66.1% of group 2. 74.8% of group 1 and 9.2% of group 2 had previous antimicrobial therapy with two antibiotics or more. 123 species of bacteria were  isolated in 82 cases (66.7%) in group 1. the predominant pathogens were gram-negative bacilli (60.6%), such as enteric coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa etc. in group 2, 89 species were obtained in 83 cases (76.2%). gram-positive streptococcus was 48.6% (streptococcus pneumoniae 15.6%). polymicrobial infections, fungal infections and bilateral involvement on radiography were more  common in group 1 than in group 2. mortality was 8.1% in group 1 and 0 in group 2 (p less than 0.01). it is suggested that patients who had underlying diseases and inappropriate antibiotic therapy were at increased risk for nosocomial infections.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities of quinolones in combination with clindamycin, metronidazole, and ornidazole.
AB  == to enhance the antimicrobial spectrum of the quinolones against anaerobic organisms and gram-positive bacteria, we investigated in two studies the parenteral combinations of ciprofloxacin (200 mg) and ofloxacin (200 mg) with metronidazole (500 mg) or clindamycin (600 mg) and the oral combinations of enoxacin (400 mg) and fleroxacin (400 mg) with metronidazole (400 mg), clindamycin (300 mg), or ornidazole (500 mg) (only with fleroxacin). the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (sbas) against 5 aerobic and 2 anaerobic species (total, 58 strains) were determined in two groups of 10 healthy volunteers by using a randomized crossover study design. the additions of metronidazole, clindamycin, and ornidazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the quinolones. the combination of clindamycin with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, fleroxacin resulted in an increase of the sba against gram-positive strains (mean peak titers): staphylococcus aureus, ciprofloxacin alone, 1:5.5; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:19.9; ofloxacin alone, 1:3.6; ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:17.5; fleroxacin alone, 1:4.3; fleroxacin-clindamycin, 1:8.1; streptococcus pneumoniae (fleroxacin and enoxacin were not tested), ciprofloxacin alone, 1:2.0; ciprofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:53; ofloxacin alone, 1:2.6; and ofloxacin-clindamycin, 1:49.2. the high sba of quinolones against gram-negative bacteria was not affected by the combinations; however, relatively  low activities against pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected. in general, against  anaerobic bacteria, low bactericidal activities were determined in both studies (mean peak titers ranged from 1:2.1 to 1:3.1; mean trough titers range from 1:2.0 to 1:2.9). in clinical settings with severe mixed infections, a parenteral therapy consisting of modern quinolones together with clindamycin or imidazole derivatives seems to be active and offers no obvious interactions.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == pefloxacin therapy for nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit.
AB  == nosocomial infections occurring in an intensive care unit (icu) are commonly caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli or staphylococcus aureus, which are frequently multi-resistant and difficult to treat and contribute significantly to the patients' morbidity in the icu. pefloxacin, with its wide range of antimicrobial activity, lack of serious side-effects and advantageous kinetics, is a useful drug for use in this group of critically ill patients. pefloxacin has achieved a greater than 70% clinical cure rate and a microbiological response of  over 80% in cases of nosocomial pneumonia in the icu. failure and superinfection  has occurred with the development of resistance, particularly in pseudomonas aeruginosa in a small number of cases, but this can be prevented by combination antimicrobial therapy. serious side-effects, including confusion, psychiatric disturbance and other neurological abnormalities were rare and resolved on withdrawal of the drug. drug interactions occur with cimetidine and theophylline  but are usually not clinically relevant; significant interaction with warfarin occurs and the dose of warfarin needs careful adjustment. pefloxacin is a valuable drug for use in bacteriologically proven sensitive infections and combination with aminoglycosides or beta-lactam agents should prevent the development of resistance.

TI  == [the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone agents against pathogenic organisms in respiratory tract infections and its clinical effect].
AB  == the efficacy rate, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), and resistance of fluoroquinolone agents against causative organisms in respiratory tract infections from january to march, 1988 were investigated. of 333 pathogenic strains 85% consisted of 5 major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus). in 61 (59 cases) of these 333 strains, including 3 cases of acute pharyngitis, 5 of acute bronchitis, 3 of pneumonia, and 48 of chronic lower respiratory tract infection fluoroquinolone agents were administered. the efficacy rate was 76.3% in all cases, and 75% in cases with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. the fluoroquinolone agents were 100% effective in h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis, though the efficacy rate was 67% in s. aureus and 40% in p. aeruginosa. the susceptibility of all strains to fluoroquinolone agents were investigated. there  was no resistant strain in h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis, though resistant strains to fluoroquinolone agents have increased in s. aureus and p. aeruginosa.  the efficacy rate was investigated using the mic of administered fluoroquinolone  agent against causative organisms. it is surmised that the efficacy of that agent has an mic of 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml.

TI  == temafloxacin in acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == temafloxacin hydrochloride, a new fluoroquinolone, was given orally in doses of 300 or 600 mg twice daily for ten days to 36 patients, all hospitalized because of severe acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. sputum cultures before, during and after treatment showed that the infection was eliminated in 12/18 evaluable patients given 300 mg and in 13/16 receiving the 600 mg doses. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae were effectively eliminated, but only half the pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were  eradicated. mics for most pathogens were 1 mg/l or less (including the majority of the pneumococci) but the mics for ps. aeruginosa ranged from 0.5 to greater than 16 mg/l, those for 10 of the 22 strains being greater than 2 mg/l. pharmacokinetic studies on serum and sputum specimens showed serum cmax values of 3.5 and 6.0 mg/l, the sputum cmax being 2.35 and 4.17 mg/l after the different doses. no interaction with concomitant theophylline could be found. two patients  complained of moderate nausea or water-brash. temafloxacin can be considered safe and effective at these dosages, but for ps. aeruginosa infections higher dosages  need to be investigated.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == stability of viable-bacterium counts in liquid media used for preparation of inocula and subsequent impact on antimicrobial susceptibility test results.
AB  == we evaluated the consequences of prolonging the time between initial bacterial inoculum suspension preparation and susceptibility test inoculation. extending the current national committee for clinical laboratory standards-recommended time of 15 min between suspension preparation and test inoculation should allow laboratories more flexibility to optimize efficiency from the standpoint of workflow. we assessed the length of time for which viable-bacterium counts remain stable in three liquid media at room temperature. fifty isolates were examined in water, saline, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broth (csmhb). disk diffusion and microdilution mic tests were performed on nine of these. our results suggest that directly prepared inoculum suspensions of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci, and enterococci can be held for up to 6 h in water or saline prior to inoculation of disk diffusion and mic tests without compromising test accuracy. the same organisms can be held for at least 1 h in csmhb. viridans group streptococci can be held for up to 6 h in saline and csmhb and for up to 3 h in water. similarly, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates may be held in csmhb for up to 3 h. because of an early decrease in viable-bacterium counts in water and saline with some h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae isolates, we recommend that  national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommendations be followed  for these species.

AB  == new approaches to antimicrobial therapy for ocular pathogens must overcome organisms that are resistant to current therapeutic modalities. this investigation examined the antimicrobial activity of novel antimicrobial neutrophil peptides (defensins np-1 and np-5) against isolates from clinical ocular microbial infections in humans and horses. the test panel of human clinical isolates included candida albicans, an alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and morganella morganii. the test panel of equine pathogens included three clinical isolates of p aeruginosa and two clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus. the equine isolates were chosen for their relative resistance to commonly employed antimicrobial therapy.  the two defensins differed markedly in their bactericidal activity. defensin np-5, at a 50-micrograms/ml concentration, exhibited minimal bactericidal activity against the majority of isolates of the test panel. the inferior microbicidal activity of np-5 is consistent with previously published results. however, at this concentration, np-5 did exhibit appreciable bacteriostatic activity against human ocular pathogens m morganii (74%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (57%), and p aeruginosa (93%) during the 2-hour incubation period.  in contrast, defensin np-1 at 10 micrograms/ml exerted potent microbicidal activity against all isolates, effecting a 2 to 3 log10 decrease in colony-forming units within a 60-minute incubation period. under the assay conditions employed, these findings demonstrate: (1) two distinct mechanisms by which defensins exert their antimicrobial activity against microbial pathogens associated with clinical ocular disease in humans and horses, and (2) that rabbit defensin np-1 is a potent antimicrobial agent against a wide array of ocular pathogens.

TI  == [activity of cefuroxime against bacterial strains isolated from acute otitis media].
AB  == the acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. the treatment of this disease  is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. the activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from  children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. these strains were: 112 strains of h. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of s. aureus; 14 strains of enterobacteriaceae, and  32 strains of corynebacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. the mics of cefuroxime against h. influenzae were low and similar (mic 50 = 1 mg/l; mic 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. overall, 90% and 98%  of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. these results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated  from acute otitis media.

TI  == antibody production in vitamin a-depleted rats is impaired after immunization with bacterial polysaccharide or protein antigens.
AB  == vitamin a nutritional status has been implicated as important in maintaining the  integrity of immune functions. we have determined the effect of vitamin a (retinol) depletion on the ability of young animals to produce antibodies after challenge with various bacterial antigens. male lewis rats raised on vitamin a-free or adequate diets were immunized either near 40 days of age, before signs  of vitamin a deficiency were apparent, or near 47 days of age when symptoms of deficiency were beginning to be manifest. for rats immunized with polysaccharide  antigens from streptococcus pneumoniae or neisseria meningitidis, antibody production did not exceed 0-19% of the response of control rats. vitamin a depletion also severely compromised the response to two t cell-dependent antigens, tetanus toxoid and sheep red blood cells. in striking contrast, retinol-depleted rats immunized with lipopolysaccharides from pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcesens produced an antibody response indistinguishable from retinol-sufficient animals. these lipopolysaccharides could elicit antibodies in rat pups, whereas the capsular polysaccharide antigens could not. this is consistent with the characteristics of type 1 and type 2 antigens, respectively. these studies indicate that retinol status is an important determinant of the humoral immune response to certain types of antigen and suggest that antibody production to capsular polysaccharides and t cell-dependent antigens is particularly dependent on adequate retinol status.

TI  == bacterial meningitis: recent advances in pathophysiology and treatment.
AB  == purpose: to review recent advances in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying bacterial meningitis that may lead to the  development of adjunctive strategies for treating this disorder. data identification: studies published from 1975 to 1989 were identified using index medicus and by reviewing the bibliographies of identified articles. study selection: we reviewed the experimental and human studies evaluating pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and antimicrobial treatment of bacterial meningitis, as well as those reviews that have contributed to our understanding of meningitis. data extraction: we evaluated the data on the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment of bacterial meningitis and considered in depth the information from animal models that may have potentially important applications in the treatment of human disease. results of data synthesis: penicillin and ampicillin remain the drugs of choice for meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria meningitidis. the third-generation cephalosporins have revolutionized the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis; one such agent, ceftazidime, is also useful for treating pseudomonas  aeruginosa meningitis. modification of subarachnoid space inflammation by anti-inflammatory agents may lessen many of the pathophysiologic consequences of  bacterial meningitis. a recent study of adjunctive dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis showed that the incidence of long-term neurologic sequelae was lower in the corticosteroid group. conclusion:  future therapy for bacterial meningitis will use recent developments in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this disease. additional studies using monoclonal antibodies against specific virulence factors and investigations into the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial cell products may lead to additional treatments that decrease the high morbidity and mortality in patients with bacterial meningitis.

TI  == serious pediatric infections.
AB  == third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. they are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. strains of haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. however, listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. as with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. cefotaxime and ceftriaxone  are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. in many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == effect of bacterial products on neutrophil migration in vitro.
AB  == chronic bronchial inflammation is associated with migration of large numbers of granulocytes into the bronchial tree. a study was designed to find out whether products of bacteria commonly isolated in chronic bronchial infection stimulate neutrophil migration in vitro. neutrophils from healthy donors were studied by a  modified boyden chamber technique. bacterial culture filtrates stimulated neutrophil migration over a wide dilution range and the chemotactic activity was  heat stable. culture filtrates derived from pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae were significantly chemokinetic and directionally chemotactic, whereas filtrates from staphylococcus aureus were only chemotactic. gel filtration of s aureus and p aeruginosa culture filtrates yielded high, medium, and low molecular weight fractions showing chemotactic activity. s pneumoniae and h influenzae yielded fractions with only low molecular weight chemotactic activity. neutrophil chemotactic responses, occurring in response to all bacterial species tested, appear to represent a defence mechanism by the host. chemoattractant activity may, however, contribute to bronchial damage mediated by products released from continuously attracted, activated neutrophils.

AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

TI  == in vitro studies of ciprofloxacin and survey of resistance patterns in current isolates.
AB  == we studied the activity of ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics against both routine and multiresistant (multi-r) clinical isolates. ciprofloxacin inhibited more than 98% of most species of enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. only acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and to a much lesser degree, providencia and serratia, were resistant. most pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible. only 1% of staphylococci were resistant; the test panel included 1200 mrsa. for most species of streptococci, the mic90 was 1 microgram/ml; for enterococci, it was 2 micrograms/ml. we also surveyed resistance in our current isolates. resistance to ciprofloxacin has increased in  a. calcoaceticus and providencia, and in streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococci. ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates tended to show increased resistance to other antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and, later, cephalosporins.

TI  == bacterial pneumonia in solid organ transplantation.
AB  == approximately 4% of recipients of solid organ transplants in the united states develop bacterial pneumonia in the posttransplant period, often in the first 3 months following transplantation. the incidence of bacterial pneumonia is highest in recipients of heartlung (22%) and liver transplants (17%), intermediate in recipients of heart transplants (5%), and lowest in renal transplant patients (1  to 2%). the crude mortality of bacterial pneumonia in solid organ transplantation has exceeded 40% in most series. beyond those risk factors identified for nosocomial pneumonia, the occurrence of primary cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection,  graft rejection, maintenance antirejection therapy with prednisone, azathioprine, and antilymphocyte globulin, antirejection therapy with high-dose corticosteroids or okt3 and splenectomy have been associated with a significantly increased risk  of bacterial pneumonia in these patients. in the first 3 months posttransplant, gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus and legionella predominate and mortality is very high, in excess of 60%. thereafter, bacterial pneumonias are caused primarily by streptococcus pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae, with considerably lower mortality. bacterial pneumonia must be suspected in any transplant patient presenting with fever and cough, especially associated with dyspnea or infiltrates on chest radiograph. if large numbers of bacteria and polymorphonuclear leukocytes are not visualized in respiratory secretions the work-up should proceed directly to fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and/or protected brush specimen to establish the microbiologic diagnosis as accurately as possible. for presumptive gram-negative bacillary pneumonia, the initial regimen must be effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa. prevention of bacterial pneumonia in transplant patients must begin with immunization against s pneumoniae and influenza a, and include precautions taken to prevent nosocomial pneumonia. it further may include measures to prevent cmv infection and the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during the first year posttransplantation. ultimately, novel technologies such as selective antimicrobial decontamination and/or protective isolation during the early postoperative period may prove effective.

TI  == therapy of otitis media.
AB  == the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, complications and sequelae, and therapy of otitis media are reviewed. otitis media is one of the most common infections in infants and children. epidemiologic studies have identified season  of the year, bottle versus breast feeding, socioeconomic status, race, sex, and daycare attendance as factors associated with the occurrence of otitis media. the condition is believed to arise secondary to eustachian tube dysfunction in the presence of viral or bacterial invasion of the nasopharynx. diagnosis is often made by direct observation of the tympanic membrane with an otoscope. if untreated, the infection can spread to other structures in the aural cavity or even to the brain and meninges. the most frequent complication of otitis media is hearing loss, which may result in speech and learning difficulties. oral antimicrobial agents--notably ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, bacampicillin, cyclacillin, erythromycin ethylsuccinate-sulfisoxazole, cefixime, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole--are the mainstay of treatment. selection of the agent should be based primarily on its spectrum of activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. other considerations include the presence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of h. influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis, adverse effects, cost, and  compliance. in cases of recurrent otitis media, antimicrobial prophylaxis or surgery may be indicated. chronic otitis media with effusion may be treated with  oral antimicrobials, but surgery may also be necessary. chronic suppurative otitis media often requires hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy with agents effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa. oral antimicrobial agents represent the treatment of choice for otitis media, but such therapy addresses only one of the several etiologic factors identified.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in sendai city  during the period from march in 1988 to february in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. three hundred strains of potential (greater  than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. many strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. on the other hand many strains of branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. the sensitivity of 45  antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (eiken, japan). no strain of the haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. none of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. none of the staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. we conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.

TI  == bacteria causing respiratory infections in children and their sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == the author lists the most frequent bacterial agents isolated from the nose and pharynx samples of children that visited the child health centre from 1983 to 1986. the gram-positive bacteria found most often were: staphylococcus aureus (44% in 1983, 40% in 1986). streptococcus pneumoniae (6% in 1983, 12% in 1986), and streptococcus haemolyticus of group "a" (14% in 1983, 19% in 1986). the isolated gram-negative bacteria were: e. coli (14%), klebsiella enterobacter (8%), and proteus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 to 4% [4, 6, 7, 16]). according to the author's analyses staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to cloxacilline (96%, no changes in the 4-year period), then to sulphametoxasol-trimetropin (95%), to lincomycine (85% no change), while to penicillin it is entirely resistant. streptococcus pneumoniae proved sensitive to ampicillin, lincocine and erythromycin (96%), to cephalosporins (83%) and to sulphamides (85%). streptococcus haemolyticus from group "a" reacted to penicillin excellently. the greatest sensitivity to gram-negative bacteria e. coli related to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (96%), chloramphenicol (91%), and to cephalosporines (90%, in 1986 only 60%). klebsiella enterobacter reacted to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (92%) and chloramphenicol (83%) and pseudomonas to aminoglycosides (95%), gentamycin (92%), while to cephalosporines and ampicillin preparations it proved totally resistant.

TI  == overview of experience with ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection.
AB  == ofloxacin is highly active against common respiratory pathogens including haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis and has clinically applicable  activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. sputum, lung tissue and bronchial mucosal concentrations of ofloxacin equal or, in most cases significantly exceed the mics of such pathogens. these in vitro attributes are reflected in the results of the worldwide ofloxacin clinical trial program which achieved overall response rates of 98% in lower respiratory tract infections, 83% in pneumonias and 87% to 95%, in open and comparative studies respectively, in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  (cb). overall bacterial eradication rates ranged from 70% for pneumococci and 84.5% for b. catarrhalis to 88.5% for h. influenzae. in lower respiratory infection ofloxacin gave equal or superior clinical results to amoxycillin or erythromycin therapy together with an overall bacterial eradication rate of 100%. clinical results comparable with standard agents were also obtained in pneumonia, cure rates ranging from 77-89% at various dosages. eradication rates proved greatest for h. influenzae (92%) and were satisfactory for klebsiella spp. (80%), although less so for pneumococci (73%). bacteriological eradication rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis ranged from 68% for pneumococcal infections, to 85% in b. catarrhalis and 94% in h. influenzae infections. ofloxacin compared favourably with pivampicillin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline  clinically. a daily oral ofloxacin dose of 400 mg produced a good clinical response in 92% of patients or more. the available clinical data therefore substantially confirm the claim of ofloxacin to offer an effective alternative in many forms of acute bacterial respiratory infection, especially where h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis are involved.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
AB  == since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. in the period from october, 1987 to september, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562  patients with respiratory tract infections. strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. the taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (120), haemophilus influenzae (170), mucoid-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), non-mucoid-producing p. aeruginosa  (87), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (35), brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. of these strains, 629 were used to determine mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. most of the major causative organisms, such as h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but  s. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of s. aureus (mcrsa) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the  patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed  by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the sensitivity of staph. aureus, staph. warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, strep.  pneumoneae and strep. faecalis to eleven 4-quinolone antibacterials was compared  by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations on nutrient agar. in all cases where the minimum inhibitory concentration was less than 10 micrograms/ml then the frequency at which 4-quinolone-resistant mutants arose was estimated using each drug at 5, 10 and 20 times its minimum inhibitory concentration. it was found with all five bacterial species tested that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most potent antibacterial and that no mutants could be detected in 10(12) bacteria for either drug with staph. warneri, strep. pneumoneae and strep. faecalis. on the other hand, mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both  5 and 10 times (but not 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected at similar frequencies in the 10(12) bacteria tested. with staph. aureus, mutants resisting 5 times (but not 10 or 20  times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were  detected in the 10(12) bacteria tested at similar frequencies. however, all mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin retained the ability to produce coagulase while the majority of ofloxacin-resistant mutants had lost their ability to produce coagulase. hence clear evidence for pathogenicity loss was observed with  ofloxacin but not with ciprofloxacin.

TI  == the role of bacterial adhesion in cystic fibrosis including the staphylococcal aspect.
AB  == the bacteriology of cystic fibrosis shows a unique and predictable progression of colonizing micro-organisms. the reason for this sequence is still not known, but  thought must be given to the idea that it may be related to the genetic disorder  in some way. if this were to be true, an understanding of the colonization mechanisms at all stages in this progression could provide valuable insights for  the development of novel therapies. as far as can be ascertained from published studies, mucus is the site of colonization in cystic fibrosis. while there is no  doubt that the major pathogen, pseudomonas aeruginosa, adheres to injured cells more avidly than to intact cells, the overwhelming evidence indicates that it also attaches more avidly to mucus than to intact airway cells by means of specific adhesin-receptor mechanisms. studies with staphylococcus aureus, the other major pathogen, are also in progress. these indicate that this organism also has an affinity for mucus. at this time the studies suggest a lesser affinity than p. aeruginosa, at least with adult mucins. these two organisms do not however appear to share the same receptor. in addition to these two major pathogens, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, pathogens of lesser importance also adhere to mucus. therefore adhesion to mucus or mucins may be a recurring theme in all airway colonization. a knowledge of the factors which control these tropisms ought to provide insights into the bacterial specificity seen in cystic fibrosis and other diseases.

TI  == sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of salmonella typhi.
AB  == enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (o), flagellar (h) and capsular (vi) antigens of salmonella typhi. the assay based on anti-o monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect s. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (lps) isolated from s. typhi. anti-h moabs detected motile s. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect vi-containing s. typhi as well as soluble vi antigen. the three assays reported here detected s. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing salmonella senftenberg, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis or streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia.  the assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.

TI  == randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == we compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours,  with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. the most commonly isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cure  rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. nine patients did not  improve. patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (k.  pneumoniae). another patient with bacteremia (pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia  (proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (p. vulgaris, providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. the third patient (s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. undrained s. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of s. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. one ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. another had persistent staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. two other patients had pneumonia (s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed  full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in  the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
AB  == enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to  various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. the following is a report of the 1986 findings. during the period from september, 1986 to march, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. of these strains, 75 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 108 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of haemophilus influenzae, 107 of pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of p. aeruginosa (mucoid production  type), 32 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, and 55 of branhamella  catarrhalis were subjected to mic determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. in addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. mic determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. from the 558 cases of  respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. of these strains, 603 could be used for mic determination. an overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, p. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. when the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. the percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. the disease which was comparatively frequent in all  age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. the next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at  an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and  also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml  cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone anti-infective agent, was evaluated against 419 ocular bacterial isolates of 55 species to determine its potential as a topical agent for the treatment of ocular infections. other agents tested in this study, in which a modified tube-dilution procedure was used, include norfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin b. ofloxacin demonstrated good to excellent activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of all bacterial strains tested (mic90) of ofloxacin was 0.5 microgram/ml for staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis, 2 micrograms/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa. these species were more susceptible to ofloxacin than to any of the nonquinolones tested. the mic90 of ofloxacin was lower than that of norfloxacin, another quinolone, against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and st. pneumoniae and equal to that of norfloxacin against p. aeruginosa. because of its broad spectrum of activity and excellent in vitro activity, we concluded that ofloxacin has the potential for development into a superior topical treatment for ocular infection.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

TI  == cefixime. a review of its antibacterial activity. pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefixime, previously designated fk027, fr17027 and cl284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. it is particularly active against many enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. cefixime has little activity  against staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. several comparative trials  in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor  20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. the most  frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. it is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == therapeutic activity of meropenem in experimental infections.
AB  == meropenem and comparative antibiotics were evaluated in five models of infection. all antibiotics were administered parenterally; imipenem was used in combination  with cilastatin but meropenem and other agents were given alone. generalized infections in mice caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa all responded to low doses of meropenem or imipenem. immunocompromised mice infected with ps. aeruginosa responded to slightly higher doses of meropenem or gentamicin but required four to seven times the dose of other agents. those given a greater challenge of ps. aeruginosa were treated most successfully by meropenem. treatment with meropenem, imipenem or ceftazidime caused significant reductions of e. coli in the urinary bladder and kidneys of mice challenged per urethram. infection with ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. lung infections caused by ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. these results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.

TI  == pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  zimbabwe, central africa.
AB  == during the 11 month period up to 30 september 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. hiv was heterosexually transmitted. predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

TI  == penetration of newer cephalosporins into cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == a review of the world literature on the penetration (ratio of concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid to concentrations of serum) and attainable antibiotic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans for cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefamandole, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone indicates that, with the exceptions of cefamandole and cefoperazone, all agents appear equivalent. we conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. for the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly escherichia coli and klebsiella (excluding pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for p. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin sc 47111 (ny-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  == the bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x mic)  and suprainhibitory (4 x mic) concentrations. five strains each of the following  microorganisms were studied: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by mics. however, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x mic and 4 x mic were tested. for many of  the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. the low mics seen for the gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x mic were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

AB  == imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. to test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several medical centers in brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding mic were  carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of s. paulo, rio de janeiro and salvador. our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this  country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding mic correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

TI  == histamine synthesis by respiratory tract micro-organisms: possible role in pathogenicity.
AB  == five bacterial species considered to be potential pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia--branhamella  catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae--were evaluated for their potential to synthesise histamine in vitro. bacterial species commonly isolated from infected  sputum but generally not considered to be pathogenic--enterobacteriacae, neisseria pharyngis, coagulase negative staphylococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, and candida albicans--were similarly studied. of the "pathogens", the gram negative species b catarrhalis, h parainfluenzae and ps aeruginosa synthesised clinically important amounts of histamine; this was not the case for  the gram positive species s aureus and s pneumoniae. of the "non-pathogenic" species, only the enterobacteriacae, as a group, were found to synthesise clinically important amounts of histamine. these results show that some gram negative bacteria, associated with acute exacerbations in respiratory infections, produce histamine and possibly other inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to their pathogenecity in the lower respiratory tract in vivo.

TI  == opsonic activity of a new intravenous immunoglobulin preparation: pentaglobin compared with sandoglobulin.
AB  == standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use consist predominantly of igg (greater than 95%). we have compared the ability of a standard preparation (sandoglobulin) with that of a new preparation (pentaglobin, containing 12% igm and 12% iga) to improve the opsonic activity of antibody-deficient human sera in  vitro. panhypogammaglobulinaemic sera were poorly opsonic for five of six organisms tested, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, but opsonized staphylococcus aureus almost normally. both immunoglobulin preparations significantly improved the opsonic activity of the antibody-deficient sera for most organisms. the major difference between the  two preparations was the ability of pentaglobin to supply opsonins for p. aeruginosa, e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, while sandogloblin was significantly more potent in opsonins for haemophilus influenzae. pentaglobin demonstrates significant in vitro opsonic activity, particularly for enterobacteria (coliforms) and p. aeruginosa. its content of igm antibodies appears to confer special properties on pentaglobin not seen with standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use. its place in clinical practice remains to be determined but it may have a possible role in augmenting host defence mechanisms in gram-negative septicaemia.

TI  == role of fluoroquinolones in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin are promising agents in the treatment of serious bronchopulmonary infections due to susceptible gram-negative micro-organisms such as haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and even pseudomonas aeruginosa. their moderative activity  against streptococcus pneumoniae may limit the use of these agents in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and in the empiric management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. further prospectively designed studies are needed to address this issue. the ability of quinolones to effectively penetrate bronchial mucosa and to be concentrated within macrophages  may afford additional advantage to these agents. they should not be used as a sole agent in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia nor anaerobic pleuropulmonary disease. quinolones are very active in experimental models of legionnaire's disease and deserve further clinical study. ciprofloxacin is a promising alternative to standard parenteral drugs in the management of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in adults with cystic fibrosis. the potential for drug interactions with theophylline must be kept in mind for patients on both of these drugs.

(ii) of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were  gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) of these gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were enterobacteriaceae were enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious gram negative bacilli. (iv) the more common species among the members of enterobacteriaceae were escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). the other common species included enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and proteus vulgaris. the frequencies of salmonella species and shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. the most common isolate among other glucose fermentative gram negative bacilli was aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). the finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in taiwan. (v) of these glucose nonfermentative gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) pseudomonas species.

AB  == many of the major alterations in plasma proteins characteristic of the hepatic acute phase response are regulated by ifn-beta 2/il-6. using a specific bioassay  for ifn-beta 2/il-6, which relies on the induction of the hepatic acute phase plasma protein alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in the human hepatoma cell line hep3b clone 2 and its inhibition by anti-rifn-beta 2/il-6 antiserum, we have detected high levels of ifn-beta 2/il-6 in the body fluids of patients with acute bacterial infections. cerebrospinal fluid from four patients with acute bacterial meningitis (streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, two cases of listeria monocytogenes) all had high levels of ifn-beta 2/il-6 (up to 500 ng/ml). two of these patients with concomitant bacteremia had lower concentrations of ifn-beta 2/il-6 in the serum (5 to 70 ng/ml). three additional patients with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria meningitidis bacteremia had high levels of serum ifn-beta 2/il-6, as did the ankle fluid of a patient with streptococcus canis arthritis. normal cerebrospinal fluid and serum had little detectable ifn-beta 2/il-6. a combination of immunoaffinity chromatography and immunoblotting procedures were used to characterize the ifn-beta 2/il-6 species present in a representative sampling of serum and cerebrospinal fluids. multiple immunoreactive species of ifn-beta 2/il-6 in the size range 23 to 30 kda as well as immunoreactive complexes in the range 60 to 70 kda were detected in human body fluids. this is the first demonstration that previous descriptions of  heterogeneity in human ifn-beta 2/il-6 species produced in cell culture correspond to observations in the infected host.

TI  == the frog palate mucosa as a model for studying bacterial adhesion to mucus-coated respiratory epithelium.
AB  == most of the methods proposed to quantify bacterial adherence to respiratory mucosa differ mainly from in vivo conditions in the absence of the mucus blanket  and in the exposure of the sub-mucosal connective tissue (smct) to the micro-organisms. we propose the frog palate as a model to study bacterial adhesion to the respiratory mucosa, with a system which allows the mucus to be preserved and the bacterial adhesion to be quantified in a standardized mucosal area, where mucociliary transport is still active. in order to evaluate the role  of respiratory mucus in bacteria-mucosa interaction, we compared the adhesion of  radiolabelled pneumococci to 12 mucus-coated and 10 non-mucus-coated frog palate  mucosae. the presence or absence of mucus was controlled by scanning electron microscopy (sem). after a 10 min incubation period, the bacterial adhesion to mucus-coated palate mucosa was five times greater (p less than 0.01) than that to uncoated mucosa. by sem, bacteria were never seen attached to ciliated cells but  could be detected on small areas where mucus was not totally eliminated. even after a 120 min contact of bacteria to uncoated mucosa, bacterial adhesion remained only half that to mucus-coated epithelium. in order to ascertain whether the exposure of the smct represented a means of attraction to bacteria, we incubated the frog palate mucosa face-down with radiolabelled pseudomonas aeruginosa. as much as 44 per cent of added bacteria adhered to exposed smct and, by sem, numerous micro-organisms were seen attached to connective tissue. in contrast, only a few bacteria were observed adhering to the mucosa, mainly to granules of mucus.

AB  == blood cultures are extremely useful in diagnosing various bacteremic diseases in  childhood. the results obtained in this study are presented in relation to two periods of equal length (1972-1978, 1979-1985). at the present time there are about 22 relevant isolates from blood cultures per 1000 admitted children and year in the department of pediatrics, and about 3 isolates per 1000 admitted children and year in the department of pediatric surgery, respectively. from newborns we isolated most frequently e. coli, staph. aureus, b-streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and yeasts. from children beyond the first month of life haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, neisseria meningitidis, and staph. aureus were the most frequent identified etiologic agents. the main factors influencing the spectrum of agents  causing bacteremia are: age of patients, status of hospitals, and applicated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

TI  == broad-host-range plasmid and m13 bacteriophage-derived vectors for promoter analysis in escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a set of bacteriophage and plasmid vectors containing xyle as a reporter gene was constructed for the analysis of promoters functional in escherichia coli and in other gram-negative bacteria. two m13 bacteriophage derivatives, m13mvdx18 and m13mmk010, were designed for rapid cloning, screening and sequencing of dna fragments promoting transcription in e. coli. to demonstrate their utility, total cellular dna from a variety of bacterial species including pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pao was shotgun cloned in m13 vectors and clones displaying promoter activity in e. coli were isolated. these randomly cloned promoters from p. aeruginosa, borrelia burgdorferi, streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacterial species were sequenced without a need for further subcloning manipulation. the promoter activity of p. aeruginosa clones was verified by subcloning inserts on a broad-host-range promoter probe vector pvdx18 and assaying the xyle transcription from these promoters in p. aeruginosa. the pvdx18 vector was also used for initial characterization of the algd promoter controlling mucoidy in p. aeruginosa. the activities of the wild-type and deletion clones of the algd promoter were compared. results indicated that the region containing direct and inverted repeats at -55 to -110 bp upstream of the mrna 5' end was important for  the activation of the algd transcription in mucoid p. aeruginosa infecting cystic fibrosis patients.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == based on a quantitative analysis of sputum cultures, pathogenic bacteria in respiratory ailments isolated in our laboratory during 1984 to 1986 were classified and analyzed. during the study period, the most frequently isolated agent was haemophilus influenzae followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, branhamella  catarrhalis and streptococcus pneumoniae. they together consisted of 70 approximately 74% of all the respiratory pathogenic bacteria isolated in our study. susceptibilities of above pathogens to antimicrobial agents were investigated using the agar dilution method. results are summarized as follows. 1. ratio of proportion of beta-lactamase producing strains among non beta-lactamase producing strains of h. influenzae markedly decreased in 1986 (6/70, 8.6%) as compared to previous years (11/73, 15.1% in 1984 and 8/49, 16.3%  in 1985). in consequence, mic90 values for penicillins reduced considerably in 1986. among the antibiotics examined cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefotaxime (ctx) were  the most active agents against h. influenzae. a development of resistance to other cephems and new quinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) was not  evident during the 3-year survey. 2. against s. pneumoniae, benzylpenicillin was  still the most active agent despite gradual increase of frequency of isolation. ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), cmx and ctx were also potent against s. pneumoniae. s. pneumoniae were frequently isolated from patients treated with new quinolones or minocycline (mino). this phenomenon may be explained by higher mic  values of these agents against s. pneumoniae. 3. of b. catarrhalis strains isolated, more than 80% were beta-lactamase positive, although mic90 were not so  high (1.56 micrograms/ml for abpc and 0.20 micrograms/ml for pipc). among the antibiotics tested, latamoxef was the most active agent against b. catarrhalis and inhibited all the strains at a concentration of 0.05 micrograms/ml or less. no resistant strains were observed against cephems, new quinolones, erythromycin  or mino. 4. p. aeruginosa appeared to be rapidly developing resistance against new quinolones in patients with chronic p. aeruginosa respiratory infections who  had been treated with these agents. in treating chronic respiratory infection due to p. aeruginosa, one must be watchful of rapid development of resistance by the  organism or its replacement with s. pneumoniae.

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

AB  == the in vitro activity of pd 127,391, a dihalogenated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and cefuroxime against 525 recent isolates and well-characterized antimicrobial agent-resistant  strains. the mics of pd 127,391 against 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria sp.,  and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. some 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci were susceptible to 0.25 micrograms of pd 127,391 per ml. against most strains, pd 127,391 was 2- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, but it was 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against b. fragilis. strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all of the quinolones tested, including pd 127,391. the mic and minimum lethal concentration of pd 127,391 against three strains of chlamydia trachomatis were each 0.06 microgram/ml, and the mic against 90% of 21 strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis was 1 microgram/ml. pd 127,391 was less active at ph 5, its maximal  activity being at ph 7 to 8. the presence of urine at ph 5.9 decreased the bactericidal activity. the protein binding of pd 127,391 was 2 to 7%, and serum had little effect on activity.

TI  == the epidemiology of respiratory tract pathogens in southern netherlands.
AB  == results of sputum cultures and susceptibility tests have been reviewed for the years 1977-1986, with approximately 1,700 positive cultures per year. haemophilus influenzae always occupied the first place, being grown in 65% of positive specimens in 1977 and 37% in 1986. streptococcus pneumoniae occupied the second place, rising from 17 to 27% in the same period, during which branhamella catarrhalis rose from 5 to 26%. based on the frequency of occurrence of individual bacterial species in the sputum cultures and on the percentage of strains resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and ofloxacin, theoretical chances of failure of blind therapy were calculated and found to be most advantageous for ofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. no explanation could be given for the increase in beta-lactamase production by b. catarrhalis, but the disappearance of haemophilus parainfluenzae may have been due to improvements in the identification procedure.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of e-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. e-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. e-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis. in general, e-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics giving 90% inhibition for e-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the activity of e-3846 increased at acid ph; in contrast, acid ph caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. in vivo, e-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental s. faecalis, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.

AB  == the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (sc-47111; ny-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. the mics of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. ninety percent of neisseria sp. and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. there was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. the protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. however, urine at ph 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at ph 7.0

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

TI  == bacterial species-dependent inhibition of human granulocyte elastase.
AB  == lung infection with streptococcus pneumoniae causes the recruitment of many granulocytes (pmn) to the alveoli, but little damage to lung structure ensues, as opposed to infections with other bacterial species that induce a similar pmn response and cause lung damage. elastase, a proteolytic enzyme of pmn, has been implicated as an agent of lung injury. we studied the interaction of different bacterial species with human pmn in vitro to determine if pmn elastase activity is affected by the species of bacteria ingested. pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and s. pneumoniae were grown, opsonized, and incubated with human pmn. after 1 h of incubation, intracellular and extracellular elastase activity was measured. s. pneumoniae reduced pmn elastase activity by 48%, whereas the other 3 species tested had only minimal effects on elastase activity. loss of elastase activity occurred with s. pneumoniae: pmn ratios as low as 2:1. adherence or ingestion of bacteria by the pmn was necessary for the decrease in elastase activity to occur; interventions that decreased phagocytosis, such as not opsonizing the bacteria, pretreatment of the pmn with cytochalasin b, and separation of bacteria from pmn by 0.22-mu filters, increased elastase activity. elisa and western blot analysis of elastase levels in these experiments suggested that normal amounts of elastase were present. thus, the loss of elastase activity we observed may be due to an elastase inhibitor present in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == evaluation of ceftriaxone and other antibiotics against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pneumoniae under in vitro conditions simulating those of serious infections.
AB  == in pursuit of an in vitro system capable of reliably predicting the activities of antibiotics in serious infections and in infections occurring in immunocompromised hosts, we evaluated the abilities of four drugs to achieve virtually complete killing of bacterial cells growing in human body fluids in amounts which are very high and close to those likely to be present in serious infections; drug concentrations varied with time as they vary in human bronchial  secretions or blood or urine (dynamic concentrations). the rationale for such a test was (i) to set up in vitro conditions as close as possible to those the antibiotics encounter in serious infections and (ii) to hold the drugs capable of almost completely killing the bacteria used in the assay to be highly active in vitro and likely to be the most efficacious in the treatment of serious infections. among the antibiotics used, ceftriaxone proved to be highly active under conditions simulating pulmonary infections and septicemias caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (bacteria grown in bronchoalveolar fluid or blood; antibiotic concentrations varying with time as in human bronchial secretions or blood) and under conditions simulating blood and urinary infections caused by escherichia coli (bacteria grown in human blood or urine; antibiotic concentrations varying as in the various fluids). gentamicin (not tested against  pneumococci) appeared to be highly active only under conditions simulating urinary infections caused by e. coli; aztreonam (not tested against pneumococci)  and ampicillin (tested only against pneumococci) did not appear to be highly active under any of the test conditions. only the combination of gentamicin plus  either ceftriaxone or aztreonam appeared to be highly active under conditions simulating serious septicemias and urinary infections caused by psudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == a low dose of recombinant interleukin 1 protects granulocytopenic mice from lethal gram-negative infection.
AB  == natural and synthetic immunomodulators that increase nonspecific resistance to infection induce interleukin 1 (il-1) production. therefore, we investigated the  effect of the administration of il-1 on the survival of lethally infected granulocytopenic mice. mice with cyclophosphamide-induced granulocytopenia were injected with approximately 10(7) pseudomonas aeruginosa in the thigh muscle at time 0; gentamicin was administered 6 hr and 23 hr later. when recombinant human  il-1 beta (one of the two forms of il-1) was given as a single i.p. injection 24  hr before the infection, survival was increased. using 80 ng of il-1 beta per mouse, survival compared to control animals was 98% vs. 71% at 24 hr, 98% vs. 60% at 30 hr, 86% vs. 36% at 36 hr, and 61% vs. 11% at 48 hr (p less than 0.001) after the infection. no effect of il-1 was observed when it was given 0.5 hr before or 6 hr after the infection. animals not treated with gentamicin also benefited from the il-1. administration of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen did not affect the activity of il-1. numbers of bacteria cultured from the blood, thigh muscle, liver, spleen, and kidney were similar in il-1-treated and control  animals. superoxide production by peritoneal macrophages was also similar in the  two groups. these studies demonstrate that il-1 pretreatment protects granulocytopenic mice against lethal pseudomonas infection and suggest that this  protection occurs through a noncellular mechanism.

TI  == a survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the united states. data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. the unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. the  duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections  (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. in 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. after treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. of 411 isolates of p. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 escherichia coli and 80% of 248 staphylococcus aureus isolates. also eradicated were 95% of 166 klebsiella, 96% of 139 proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other proteus, 94% of 123 enterobacter, 100% of 68 haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 citrobacter, 89% of 45 serratia, 95% of 41 streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 salmonella, 100% of 38 morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 providencia isolates. adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. the most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated sgot, sgpt, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). crystalluria,  judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == pharmacokinetics of enoxacin and its penetration into bronchial secretions and lung tissue.
AB  == pharmacokinetic data were obtained from four healthy volunteers after oral administration of a single 400 or 600 mg dose of enoxacin. enoxacin was absorbed  quickly and absorption was increased when enoxacin was ingested after a meal. renal clearance of enoxacin and 4-oxo-enoxacin decreased after simultaneous administration of probenecid. in addition, pharmacokinetic parameters of enoxacin and its 4-oxo metabolite were determined for plasma and sputum from 19 patients treated with enoxacin, 400 or 600 mg bd, for a respiratory tract infection. the half-life of both enoxacin and 4-oxo-enoxacin was 5-6 h; during treatment with 400 and 600 mg bd, the plasma concentrations exceeded mic values for most bacteria isolated in respiratory tract infections, including most pseudomonas aeruginosa strains; streptococcus pneumoniae was an exception. diffusion from plasma to sputum was approximately 100%. of an ingested dose, 60-65% was recovered in the urine in 24 h. in a third study, a single 600 mg dose of enoxacin was given to 15 patients undergoing thoracotomy. subsequent lung tissue  concentrations of enoxacin were significantly higher than plasma concentrations at the same time after ingestion.

TI  == enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  == enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. the mbcs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the mics, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. no single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. in systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against  one strain each of enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia rettgeri and ps. aeruginosa, and two staphylococcus aureus strains. single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.

TI  == enoxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a comparison with amoxycillin.
AB  == a total of 43 hospitalized adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis due to gram-negative bacteria were randomized to receive either enoxacin (400 mg bd) or amoxycillin (1,000 mg tid) for 7-12 days.  micro-organisms isolated included 24 haemophilus influenzae (three beta-lactamases positive), 11 branhamella catarrhalis (six beta-lactamase positive), two pseudomonas aeruginosa and two neisseria meningitidis in 37 evaluable patients. in the enoxacin group (23 patients) 82.6% of the patients were clinically cured or improved against 93% of patients in the amoxycillin group (14 patients). in the enoxacin group 76% of the pathogens were eradicated with two failures (p. aeruginosa), one relapse (h. influenzae) and three superinfections (streptococcus pneumoniae). in the amoxycillin group, 71% of the  pathogens were eradicated with 29% relapses. the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. an increase in theophylline concentration occurred in 15 of 16 patients receiving simultaneous administration of theophylline, without clinical evidence of toxicity when theophylline dosage was reduced and enoxacin continued. enoxacin appears to be as effective as amoxycillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to  susceptible gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vivo postantibiotic effect in a thigh infection in neutropenic mice.
AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. we demonstrated and standardized the in vivo pae in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant paes. against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce paes against streptococci. with few exceptions the in vivo pae correlated well with the pae reported in prior in vitro studies. residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the pae. theoretically, the presence of a pae may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  == collaborated studies on species of respiratory tract infection (rti)-related organisms for their identification and drug susceptibilities have been carried out since 1981 at about 20 centers in japan. on this occasion, the data obtained  between 1982 and 1985 were reanalyzed to determine whether or not drug susceptibilities differed depending upon diseases, from which the organisms were  isolated. the results summarized below were obtained in this study. 1. among staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa examined, differences in drug susceptibilities according to different diseases were found among s. aureus and also mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa. 2. susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was definitely lower in s. aureus strains isolated from pneumonia than in those isolated from chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasia. 3. the isolation frequency of methicillin-and cefazolin-resistant strains of s. aureus was 30.3% and 25.9%, respectively, and was especially high among strains isolated from pneumonia. the antibiotic potency of minocycline against s. aureus, including methicillin resistant s. aureus, was the strongest among 9 drugs examined; s. aureus maintained relatively sufficient sensitivity to dicloxacillin among beta-lactam antibiotics. 4. mucoid producing strains of p. aeruginosa isolated from chronic bronchitis had slightly lower drug susceptibility than those isolated from bronchiectasia. 5. when drug susceptibilities of h. influenzae were compared among groups separated according to diseases using mic50, mic80 and mic90 as indicators, there were no clear differences. the isolation frequency of ampicillin (abpc)-resistant strains, however, was clearly  different among diseases; namely, resistant strains were the most and the least frequently isolated from chronic bronchitis and from pneumonia, respectively. in  addition, the drug susceptibility of h. influenzae isolated in 1985 was analyzed  in relation to the production of beta-lactamase. as a result, it was suspected that some factors, other than beta-lactamase, participated in the mechanism of abpc-resistance. 6. these results suggest that drugs to be used for the chemotherapy of rti should be selected considering the fact that drug susceptibilities of the pathogens differ, even among the same species, according  to diseases.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  == broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. we evaluated the management  of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of  catheter. seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. the catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. the most common microorganisms isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group d enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms p. aeruginosa and candida albicans. based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. these findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.

AB  == the new fluoroquinolones have activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in order to differentiate between the compounds, the authors have compared their in vitro activities and correlated these results with their in vivo efficacies. norfloxacin (n), pefloxacin (p), enoxacin (e), ofloxacin (o), difloxacin (d), ciprofloxacin (c), fleroxacin (f), a-61827 (a), temafloxacin (t)  and lomefloxacin (l) were used in these studies. in vitro, c was the most active  compound against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and a was the most active compound against gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. in mouse protection  tests, c, d, a, o, t and f had similar activities against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d, t and a were the most active quinolones against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes and strep. pneumoniae in mouse protection tests. d was the most active agent against intracellular infection with salmonella typhimurium, followed by o, t, a and f. the other compounds were  ineffective in this test. all the quinolones were effective in treating e. coli pyelonephritis in mice. the doses required to treat p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis  in mice were four times greater than those required to treat e. coli. resistant p. aeruginosa mutants could be isolated from the kidneys after quinolone treatment. systemic infections with e. coli, staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa in neutropenic mice required high doses of the fluoroquinolones and f, t and a were  ineffective at doses of 100 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa in this model. differences in in vitro potencies were not reflected in in vivo efficacies.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  == the microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. phase i validated the ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose  injection and testing for recovery. phase ii validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions. phase iii compared inpatient and home tpn microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase ii. test organism inocula used in  phase i and ii were candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. all contaminated  solutions in phase i showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. all phase ii-contaminated tpn solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. one hundred postinfusion tpn samples were collected randomly during phase iii from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. none of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient tpn samples developed visible turbidity. subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. this described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates  of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.

AB  == nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (nho) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot  puncture (3). infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). in 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: staphylococcus aureus (9), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter sp. (2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == respiratory infections: clinical experiences with the new quinolones.
AB  == nearly 300 patients, admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease, have been treated with various newer quinolones: 26  patients received enoxacin, 50 pefloxacin, 80 ciprofloxacin and 143 ofloxacin. dosages varied from 400 mg once daily to 1000 mg twice daily. orally for five to  10 days. patients were evaluated bacteriologically and clinically before, during  and after treatment. nearly all infections associated with haemophilus influenzae and/or branhamella catarrhalis were successfully eradicated. some streptococcus pneumoniae infections relapsed, some could not be eradicated, and a number of patients developed new infections with these organisms. approximately half of the pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were eradicated. nearly all patients received concomitant theophylline but this only caused serious problems in those given 600 mg doses of enoxacin twice daily. five patients given ciprofloxacin had to discontinue because of unwanted effects (mostly hallucinations), one patient given pefloxacin had gastric pain and two patients given ofloxacin developed a skin rash. apart from the theophylline interaction, the unwanted effects did not  appear to be dose-related. the best overall clinical results were noted after 800 mg doses of ofloxacin once daily for seven days.

TI  == effect of antimicrobials on blood cultures in endocarditis.
AB  == to study the effect of antimicrobials on bacterial growth in blood cultures, we used both simulated blood cultures and cultures obtained from rabbits with experimental endocarditis. four strains of bacteria were incubated individually with six antimicrobials in nine blood culture media. positivity rates varied with the ratio of the antimicrobial concentration to the mic of the organism: 161 of 162 cultures (99%) were positive when the ratio was less than 1/10; 52 of 108 (48%) were positive when the ratio was between 1/10 and one; and none of 54 were  positive when the ratio was greater than one. endocarditis was produced in 28 rabbits with either e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, or viridans streptococcus. following a single dose of an antimicrobial, blood was taken for culture in eight media. only for viridans streptococcus did recovery rates vary significantly in different media. recovery rates for this organism in two supplemented peptone broths (78% and 89%) and in hypertonic supplemented peptone (78%) were each higher than in thioglycolate (22%), columbia (22%), bactec aerobic and anaerobic  (11%), and trypticase soy broths (11%) (p less than 0.05 for each pair). growth of bacteria in blood cultures containing antimicrobials depended on the ratio of  the antimicrobial concentration to the mic and, for viridans streptococcus, the blood culture medium.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  == cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. it  inhibits the majority, 90%, of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes,  branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it inhibits 90% of the other members of the  enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii, cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, listeria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. in general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.

TI  == epidemiology of microbial keratitis in southern california. a multivariate analysis.
AB  == two hundred twenty-seven cases of microbial keratitis reported in nonreferral county practice were studied. the staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae, were the major isolates. a multivariate statistical model was developed to evaluate possible predisposing and outcome determinants. several racial and age-related relationships were shown. the interaction of numerous local ocular and systemic factors played a fundamental role in causing disease. the authors found significant association between s. pneumoniae and topical steroid use, and direct and indirect linkage of s. aureus with diabetes and trauma, respectively. s. pneumoniae and moraxella were risk factors for major complications (24% of cases); s. pneumoniae was related to enucleation and late perforation. corneal exposure and prior topical steroids were associated with prolonged hospital stays. hypopyon was associated with pneumococcal infection, 60 years of age or older, and trauma. the identification of groups at high-risk for  microbial keratitis and problems of preventive management are discussed.

TI  == bacterial capsular polysaccharides--biochemistry, immunity and vaccine.
AB  == the biochemical basis of immunogenicity to bacterial capsular polysaccharides (pss) has been extensively studied. antibody responses to ps antigens can be greatly affected by their physico-chemical properties, e.g. molecular size, specific determinants, conformation etc. at present, three bacterial ps vaccines, including meningococcal, pneumococcal, and h. influenzae type b, have been licensed in the u.s.a. many other pss, such as group b streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella, are still in various stages of vaccine development. studies on the type distribution of pneumococcal isolates from asian populations  showed that the types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine were considerably fewer in asia than that observed in the u.s.a.: the proportion of types was 62.9% in taiwan, 72.9% in japan and 87.9-92.8% in the u.s.a. a large number of pneumococcal types found in taiwan and japan, such as 15a, 23a, 24f and 34, are not present in the pneumococcal vaccine. immunization with one type of group 9 or 19f ps induced a poor antibody response to the other type. all 9n, 9v, 19f and 19a pss are required in the vaccine to induce sufficient antibodies against group 9 and 19 infection. extensive cross-reactions have been found between pneumococcal pss and pss from other bacteria. klebsiella k2 ps could enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to 19f ps. the structure of streptococcal 14636/74 was found to be identical to pneumococcal 19f ps. a difficult problem in the development of vaccines against bacterial diseases is the poor immune response of young children to purified pss. antibodies against the pss can be elicited when ps antigens are conjugated to a protein carrier. in  mice, the maternal immunization with pneumococcal ps during pregnancy or before mating, did not cause suppression or other observable harmful effect, rather it may provide sufficient antibodies for protection against infection during early life.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber.
AB  == tertiary amine was covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber and examined for antibacterial activity. the tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber (taf) showed a high antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli. taf exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, and  serratia marcescens) than against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis) or candida albicans. this activity against e. coli was accentuated by 0.1% deoxycholate or 10 mg of actinomycin d per ml, to which e. coli is normally not susceptible. this implies that taf causes an increase of  the bacterial outer membrane permeability. on the other hand, the antimicrobial activity was inhibited by adding mg2+ or by lowering the ph. this suggest an electrostatic interaction between the bacterial cell wall and taf. scanning electron microscopy showed that e. coli cells were initially attached to taf, with many projections on the cell surface, but then were apparently lysed after contact for 4 h. taken together, these results imply that bacteria initially interact with taf by an electrostatic force between the anionic bacterial outer membrane and the cationic tertiary amine residues of taf and that longer contact  with taf damages the bacterial outer membrane structure and increases its permeability.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  == it has been more than 4 years since third-generation cephems were introduced into clinical practice. the range of our drug selection definitely tends to increase,  because we today have more antibiotics with wider spectrum, antibiotics with strong activities only against gram-negative strains, such as monobactams, and those with tremendously high activities such as quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, in comparison to those we had in the past. among isolates obtained mainly from sputa of 567 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 16 institutions throughout japan between september of 1985 and march of 1986, 741 strains were determined to be causative organisms. mic's of various antimicrobial agents were determined against 67 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of non-mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40 strains of mucoid p. aeruginosa, 29 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 strains of escherichia coli and for 42 strains of branhamella catarrhalis out of the above 741 strains to determine their drug sensitivities. as for types of lower respiratory tract infections found in 1981--1983, 57.9--64.5% of the infections were chronic respiratory infections; i.e., chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. these chronic infections, including diffuse panbronchiolitis (dpb), were found in 63.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in 1984. their incidence dropped to 54.0% in 1985, even though dpb was included; i.e., the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis  was 5.5%, that of dpb was 7.1%, and that of bronchial asthma associated with lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was 8.8% which was twice as much as that found in 1981--1984. although bacterial pneumonia was found in 24.8% of all  the cases in 1981, its incidence was reduced to 11.0% in 1983, 15.1% in 1984, and 17.6% in 1985. this reduction seemed to have resulted from gradual decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia among the young population. as with usual years, a high incidence rate in a total lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was found among older patients; namely, 73.5% was at the age of 50 or over (417/567). next, we determined relationships between clinical isolates and isolates from respiratory infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and dpb. h. influenzae was isolated from 50.5% of patients with these infections in 1981; however, the detection rate decreased by  about 20% to 29.7% in 1985. p. aeruginosa was consistently isolated, between 24.1% and 30.4% every year.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. a broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. in a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees c, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). median age was 7 years (2 months-16  years). in patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was  added after 48 hours. the effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. the first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. bacteria were isolated in 39 children: escherichia coli: 9, staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, staphylococcus aureus: 8, streptococcus: 6, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, haemophilus: 1, klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, proteus: 1, serratia: 1, flavobacterium: 1. in these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and  netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. all blood culture were negative after the first combination. the median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). there were no death, no superinfection. tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. we conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.

TI  == post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the post-antibiotic suppressive effect (pae) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a pae against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the paes of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis were determined. the differences in pae determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for s. aureus and e. coli. ciprofloxacin had a pae by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. a ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in mueller-hinton broth, ph 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a pae of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for s. aureus, but had no effect on s. faecalis. exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour pae for e. coli, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae. use of mueller-hinton broth with a  magnesium concentration of 8 mm, ph 5.5, yielded similar results. using human serum, a four-hour pae was found for p. aeruginosa. there was a progressive increase in the pae as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from  0.9 hours to three hours. increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to  eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for p. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the mbc for e. coli did not cause a significant difference  in the pae using a two-hour exposure. overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent pae for most gram-negative bacteria and for s. aureus, but not for s. faecalis. a pae caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the ph adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. these results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment  of tissue and urinary infections.

TI  == efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of serious respiratory infections.
AB  == fifty-two patients with serious respiratory infections were treated with orally administered ciprofloxacin; 42 patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis  and all were evaluable for determining adverse reactions. cures were achieved in  24 patients with infections (14 with bronchitis, 10 with pneumonia) caused by hemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, or branhamella catarrhalis, and  pathogens were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. seventeen patients had infections (seven bronchitis, 10 pneumonia) caused by enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa; many of these patients were critically ill and were enrolled in the study because their pathogens were resistant to multiple drugs or because their infections had not responded to alternate antimicrobial therapy. all patients had favorable clinical responses, and members of the enterobacteriaceae were rapidly eradicated from respiratory secretions. however,  five of 12 strains of p. aeruginosa persisted during treatment; minimal inhibitory concentrations for these strains increased 4- to 16-fold as infections continued to resolve. one patient with staphylococcus aureus infection also showed a response. ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea, vomiting, or both in three of the 52 patients and possibly contributed to similar symptoms in another  three patients (6 to 12 percent). other possible adverse reactions, including central nervous system symptoms, were also observed but were not clearly drug-related.

TI  == [recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in japan (1979-1984). part 4. a classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  == the survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (ac) filters on a bench scale was investigated. the results revealed that  after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized ac absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). after a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/g of ac. when klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. the numbers of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida, however, decreased immediately  and showed no regrowth in nonsterile ac from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). these bacteria reduced e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. the  hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. competition  for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

AB  == twenty-five infants and children with acute osteomyelitis (n = 7), suppurative arthritis (n = 11), or both (n = 7) were treated with imipenem and cilastatin sodium. patients ranged in age from 5 months to 11.3 years. needle aspiration of  infected sites was performed in all patients, and 11 (44%) required further surgical drainage. imipenem and cilastatin sodium in a dosage of 100 mg/kg/d was  used for children 3 years of age or younger, while older ones received 60 mg/kg/d intravenously, divided in four equal doses. bacterial pathogens were identified in 15 patients (60%): staphylococcus aureus in five, haemophilus influenzae b in  four, pseudomonas aeruginosa in two, streptococcus pneumoniae in one, group a streptococcus in one, kingella kingae in one, and citrobacter amalonaticus in one. all isolates were susceptible to imipenem in vitro. imipenem and cilastatin  therapy was continued for a median of six days followed by treatment with appropriate orally administered antibiotics. median peak serum bactericidal titers after imipenem and cilastatin infusions were 1:512 for s aureus, 1:32 for  h influenzae b, 1:512 for streptococci, and 1:16 for gram-negative rods. all but  one patient with p aeruginosa osteomyelitis responded favorably to imipenem and cilastatin. the median duration until resolution of symptoms was six days. imipenem and cilastatin infusions were well tolerated, and side effects included  maculopapular rash in one patient, watery diarrhea in one, and mild transient elevation of alanine aminotransferase levels in three. because of imipenem and cilastatin's unusually broad spectrum of activity and its relative safety, this drug combination can be used for the initial, empiric therapy of acute bone and joint infections in pediatric patients.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a semisynthetic penem derivative, was compared with that of sch 34343, imipenem, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and ceftazidime and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 628 recent isolates and other beta-lactam-resistant strains. the mics of cgp 31608 against 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., bacteroides spp., clostridium spp., staphylococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae were between 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. the susceptibility of beta-lactamase-producing strains and known porin mutants of the enterobacteriaceae suggests that cgp 31608 is resistant to many important beta-lactamases (including the mutationally derepressed chromosomal enzymes) and  is not excluded from the bacterial cell in strains expressing these known porin mutations. generally, cgp 31608 was less active than imipenem, sch 34343, and the cephalosporins, except against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of cgp 31608  against staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) was greater than that of the cephalosporins. the major target site in escherichia coli k-12 for cgp 31608 was penicillin-binding protein 2. the serum protein binding of 5 micrograms of cgp 31608 per ml was 14%, and serum had little effect  on activity.

TI  == [significance of haemophilus influenzae and other microorganisms for the pathogenesis and therapy of chronic respiratory infection].
AB  == the host's respiratory defence mechanisms are transformed to chronic inflammatory reactions by the persistence of microorganisms and hence inflict damage on the host's own tissues. this change primarily reduces the capability of the mucociliary defence mechanisms. such impairment can result from modifications to  the mucus's physical chemical properties after an infection, or from damage to the ciliary epithelium. haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae cause ciliary dyskinesia and eventually lead to the destruction of the ciliary epithelium. encapsulated type b h. influenzae strains  appear to slow down the cilia most markedly. there is a fundamental difference between acute and chronic infections. in the case of acute infections the patient's normal defence mechanisms are usually intact. in chronic infections the chronic inflammatory response to the microorganisms causes the disease to progress. in such cases treatment must be considerably more aggressive since the  host's "cleansing" capability is diminished. thus, antibiotics must be applied which can effectively penetrate the bronchial tree and which also remain stable and bioactive in the presence of beta-lactamase producing microorganisms such as  h. influenzae. it is conceivable that, in the future, antibiotic therapy will have to be combined with antiphlogistic agents.

TI  == penetration of ofloxacin into bronchial secretions.
AB  == the penetration of ofloxacin into bronchial secretions was evaluated in 16 patients after administration of a single oral dose of ofloxacin 400mg. bronchial secretions were aspirated at bronchoscopy after 1 to 6 hours and serum was collected simultaneously. ofloxacin concentrations were measured by a microbiological assay method. considerable individual variations in serum and bronchial aspirate concentrations were recorded: bronchial aspirate concentrations varied between 1.1 mg/l and 4.5 mg/l but exceeded 1.5 mg/l in 14 of 16 patients between 1 and 6 hours. the ratio between simultaneous mean bronchial aspirate and serum concentrations ranged between 0.53 in the second hour and 0.92 in the fourth hour. it is likely that inhibitory activity will be sustained over at least 6 hours against most potential respiratory pathogens including haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa may have minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values lower than ofloxacin concentrations achieved in bronchial secretions, although some isolates are less sensitive. clinical studies should establish the relevance of pharmacokinetic data to respiratory infections  caused by organisms of borderline susceptibility.

AB  == the synthesis of new cephalosporin antibiotics has provided agents which can effectively be used to treat most of the different forms of meningitis. none of the first generation cephalosporins can be considered acceptable as agents to treat meningitis. cefuroxime can be used to treat meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis in children. agents such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are appropriate for neonatal meningitis due to escherichia coli and group b streptococci, but not listeria monocytogenes. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and ceftazidime have all proved effective as therapy of meningitis in children and adults when the pathogens are pneumococci,  h. influenzae or n. meningitidis, but they have not been shown to yield an improved mortality or lower morbidity in spite of much greater cerebrospinal fluid (csf) bactericidal titres. cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime have been effective as therapy of meningitis due to e. coli, k. pneumoniae and proteus species, but failures have occurred with all of the cephalosporins when used to treat meningitis due to enterobacter spp. and serratia marcescens. only ceftazidime yields adequate csf concentrations to treat meningitis due to pseudomonas aeruginosa. overall, the cephalosporins can now be  considered a major component of the therapy of acute bacterial meningitis irrespective of the age group to be treated.

AB  == the distribution of respiratory tract infections (rti) among the general population is not uniform. the incidence in neonates and the elderly (older than  65) is 2 to 3 times higher than that in adults. examinations to determine the responsible pathogen are conducted in less than 1% of cases of rti. the overall incidence of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae in hospitalized  patients amounts to 13 to 27%. the incidences of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella and pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units are approximately 20% each. the management of the disease should be based on an aetiological diagnosis, and must take the individual patient's condition into account. examination of the sputum or bronchial rinsing fluid is still the most reliable form of diagnosis, however, a sufficient number of quantitative methods must be applied. in hospitalized--and especially intensive care--patients these methods are often successful in isolating h. influenzae and pneumococci which we cannot afford to ignore as pathogens.

TI  == [prevention of gram-negative and gram-positive infections with 3 intravenous immunoglobulin preparations and therapy of experimental polymicrobial burn infection with intravenous pseudomonas immunoglobulin g and ciprofloxacin in an animal model].
AB  == three immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous infusion were compared in vivo  to determine their relative protective capacity against several gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. polyglobin n is a conventional igg concentrate. psomaglobin n is identical in formulation to polyglobin n but is prepared from the plasma of donors who have naturally high levels of antibody to lipopolysaccharide antigens of pseudomonas aeruginosa. iggma is a conventional igg concentrate containing 12% igg and 16% iga. in a murine model of burn wound sepsis the three igg preparations were similarly protective against three or ten  strains of p. aeruginosa. psomaglobin n and polyglobin n were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.015) more protective than iggma against six of ten and three of ten strains of p. aeruginosa, respectively. in a murine model of streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 pneumonia, the three ig preparations were similarly protective. iggma was significantly more protective (p less than or equal to 0.025) than psomaglobin n and polyglobin n against salmonella typhimurium in murine peritonitis. however, the mean protective dose (pd50) of the two later preparations was less than or equal to 20 mg/kg body weight. in models of peritonitis both psomaglobin n and polyglobin n were more protective than iggma (p less than or equal to 0.004) against haemophilus influenzae b, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens 06:h3 and group b streptococcus types  1b and 1c. psomaglobin n and ciprofloxacin were employed to treat established polymicrobial murine burn wound sepsis resulting from contamination of the burn site with mixtures of p. aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == postantibiotic effect of imipenem on gram-positive and gram-negative micro-organisms.
AB  == the bactericidal effect (be) of an antibiotic reduces the infective population, and its postantibiotic effect (pae) assures a persistent inhibition of bacterial  cells after a short exposure to the antimicrobial agent. both effects prevent the early regrowth of the infecting organisms when the antibiotic tissue levels decrease to below the mic value. the be and the pae of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were investigated with viable counts and continuous impedance monitoring of broth cultures. imipenem and gentamicin gave similar high be and pae values at low concentrations and with short drug exposures in most strains tested. pae is low or non-existent for gram-negative strains with other beta-lactam antibiotics. these results suggest the possibility of future clinical studies with new experimental dosage schedules for imipenem.

AB  == the added risk of infectious complications due to splenectomy in patients already immunocompromised because of chronic leukemia was studied over a 22 year period.  when compared to patients with chronic leukemia who did not undergo splenectomy,  survival was not influenced. splenectomy did significantly increase the total number of serious infections (65 percent versus 35 percent, p less than 0.001), the number of infections per patient (p less than 0.05), and the interval between infections (p less than 0.01) in this patient population. fatal septic episodes were not due to streptococcus pneumoniae, but did occur significantly more often  in the splenectomy group (22 percent versus 7 percent, p less than 0.05). although the location of infection was similar, there was a significant difference in the number of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in the patients who had undergone splenectomy (p less than 0.05). consideration must be given to the  significantly increased risk of postoperative infectious morbidity in patients with chronic leukemia when evaluating the usefulness of splenectomy.

AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to determine the mic50 and mic90 of imipenem  in comparison with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin and azlocillin. eight hundred and eighteen of the 828 (98.8%) unselected gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by imipenem at a concentration of 8 mg/l or  less. imipenem was shown to be superior to the other four beta-lactam antibiotics against acinetobacter calcoaceticus (40 strains), all the staphylococcus aureus (80 strains, 10 of them penicillin- and methicillin-resistant), streptococcus faecalis (20 strains) and salmonella spp. (50 strains). imipenem and cefotaxime were the most active against str. pneumoniae (20 strains). against escherichia coli (52 strains) the activity of imipenem was similar to that of ceftadizime and superior to the other three antibiotics. imipenem was two-fold inferior to cefotaxime and four-fold inferior to ceftazidime against serratia marcescens (52  strains) and superior to piperacillin and azlocillin. against pseudomonas aeruginosa (300 strains), ps. cepacia (104 strains) and indole positive proteus (52 strains), only ceftazidime was better than imipenem. this study confirms published results that point to the impressive spectrum of activity offered by imipenem.

TI  == experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the intensive care unit.
AB  == twenty-two patients admitted to the icu with a severe nosocomial infection caused by multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli were treated with imipenem combined with cilastatin. we treated nine cases of meningo-ventriculitis, eight cases of septicaemia, four cases of mediastinitis, and one case of pneumonia. the bacteria responsible were acinetobacter spp. (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), enterobacter cloacae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), proteus spp. (2), streptococcus spp. (2), serratia marcescens (1). more than one pathogen was isolated in five cases. the dosages ranged between 1.5 g to 4 g per day by intravenous infusion; the highest doses were used for the treatment of meningitis. the mean duration of treatment was 17 days. an aminoglycoside was combined with imipenem in 18 cases. cure was obtained in 17 out of the 22 cases.  very rapid sterilization of the csf in the cases of meningitis and ventriculitis  was noted. two patients died rapidly despite eradication of the bacteria. one case of meningitis relapsed but cure was subsequently obtained with continuation  of the same treatment. in three cases of ps. aeruginosa infection, resistant mutants were isolated from the sites of infection and were responsible for two failures and one colonization. imipenem appears to be an antibiotic of choice in  severe nosocomial infections including meningo-ventriculitis, especially those caused by acinetobacter spp. and ps. aeruginosa. it is also one of the few antibiotics active against both streptococci and multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli. careful bacteriological monitoring is recommended during treatment.

TI  == bacteria associated with obstructive pulmonary disease elaborate extracellular products that stimulate mucin secretion by explants of guinea pig airways.
AB  == certain cell-free filtrates from broth cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa, hemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae stimulate secretion of glycoconjugates by explants of guinea pig trachea. the stimulatory effect is not  related to toxicity or damage to the respiratory mucosa, as well as could be determined by ultrastructural examination of the explants after exposure. bacteria isolated from patients with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease (p aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis, h influenzae, and s pneumoniae from chronic bronchitis) do not demonstrate increased frequency of positive strains or greater stimulation of secretion than organisms isolated from other individuals.  at least three stimulatory substances are found in cell-free filtrates of p aeruginosa. they appear to be proteins of molecular weight 60,000-100,000 as determined by gel filtration. within the crude filtrate, they are relatively stable to heat, proteolysis, and storage at 4 c and in liquid nitrogen. the stimulatory activity is not lost upon subculture of the bacteria. when isolated from the filtrate by column chromatography, they become labile to heat and trypsin. isolated active fractions show proteolytic activity coinciding with mucin-stimulating capacity, suggesting a relationship with pseudomonas proteases. stimulatory substances released by s pneumoniae and h influenzae appear to be different from those elaborated by pseudomonas. they are extremely labile to heat and storage, and the capacity to stimulate secretion is lost on subculture. preliminary gel filtration indicates the s pneumoniae stimulatory substance(s) is in a molecular weight range of 100,000-300,000 daltons, while that of h influenzae is between 50,000 and 200,000. the results suggest bacteria which chronically infect or colonize respiratory airways of individuals suffering from  obstructive lung disease can elaborate extracellular product(s) capable of stimulating secretion of mucin. thus, the bacteria themselves may contribute to local manifestations and, ultimately, to the pathogenesis of obstructive disease.

TI  == [antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from surgical infections (first report)].
AB  == in vitro activities of several antimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with primary and postoperative infections were investigated in 1982 and 1983. antimicrobial agents examined were as follows: sulbenicillin (sbpc), piperacillin (pipc), cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm), cefoperazone (cpz), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftizoxime (czx), cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), lincomycin (lcm), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk). specimens for bacterial isolation included plus, fluid drawn by centesis, or bile. blood samples of septicemia were excluded. the antimicrobial activities of these drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution method of the japanese society of chemotherapy. there were 123 strains obtained in the 1982 survey and 252 strains in the 1983 survey. little or no differences were seen in frequencies of isolation between the isolates of principal species in 1982 and those in 1983. isolation frequencies of pathogens in primary infections were, in an order of decreasing frequency, e. coli (25.6%), anaerobes (21.1%), streptococcus sp. (14.3%), staphylococcus sp. (11.3%); in postoperative infections, streptococcus sp. was most frequent (28.6%), followed by pseudomonas sp. (17.6%), anaerobes (12.6%), e. coli (10.9%), staphylococcus (10.1%). against s. aureus, cez, ctm, lcm and gm had similar degree of activity with cet being somewhat more active. cmx was the most active drug among the third generation cephems tested against s. aureus. no strain was ctm, cez, and lcm-resistant at the same time. over 90% of e. coli, were sensitive to ctx, czx and cmx, inhibited by 0.10 microgram/ml, while e. coli were slightly less susceptible to cpz and lmox. penicillins were not very active against k. pneumoniae, and only 60% of k. pneumoniae were inhibited by pipc at concentrations of 12.5 micrograms/ml. third generation cephems, ctx, cmx and czx, proved highly active against k. pneumoniae; over 90% of k. pneumoniae was inhibited by ctx, cmx and czx at a concentration of 0.10 microgram/ml. about 60%  of p. aeruginosa was inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml of pipc and gm but was resistant to sbpc. this survey should be very useful for the selection of an appropriate drug for prophylaxis if the frequencies of incidences of pathogens in postoperative infections are taken into account in selecting the most active antibiotic agent(s) against the most frequent genus, genera and species of pathogens.

TI  == beta-lactam antibiotics: structural relationships affecting in vitro activity and pharmacologic properties.
AB  == the essential nucleus of beta-lactam antibiotics is the four-membered ring, which can exist fused to form bicyclic ring structures or with moieties alone affixed to the four atoms. penicillins, penems, carbapenems, and clavams have asymmetric  centers at c-5 and c-6; cephalosporins and oxacephems have asymmetric centers at  c-6 and c-7. penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams require a beta-acylamino group for antimicrobial activity. cephalosporins can undergo modification at c-3 and c-7 in both the alpha and beta position. sulfur can be replaced with oxygen to achieve a more reactive nucleus. the most useful 7-beta-acylamino groups have been a 2-aminothiazolyl and an iminomethoxy or carboxypropyl group. substitutions on the 7-alpha position increase beta-lactamase stability but decrease activity against staphylococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. c-3 substitutions, particularly pyridinium groups, increase activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. carbapenems possess 6-alkyl substitutions in a trans configuration and inhibit aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive, and gram-negative bacteria. monobactams are activated by sulfonic, phosphoric, or carboxyl groups, and their properties are related to the c-3-acyl side chain and their beta-lactamase stability to the c-4  grouping. beta-lactamase inhibitors acylated by beta-lactamases can be penicillanic acid derivatives or clavulanates.

AB  == the growth-enhancing effects of culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae, as well as normal floral bacteria other than neisseria perflava and branhamella catarrhalis on l-forms of h. influenzae were examined in vitro, using five species of major respiratory pathogenic bacteria and seven species of normal floral bacteria commonly isolated from the sputum of patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. the growth-enhancing factor(s) was present in the filtrates prepared from the culture of respiratory pathogenic streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, the effects of which were as potent as those of a culture filtrate of b. catarrhalis  used as the positive control. the culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae had weak growth-enhancing effects on h. influenzae l-forms. the culture filtrates of 21 strains of normal floral bacteria isolated from the sputum including alpha-hemolytic streptococci,  non-hemolytic streptococci, micrococcus roseus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and neisseria spp. had growth-enhancing effects on the l-forms of h. influenzae.  these data elucidate the significance of l-forms of h. influenzae in recurrent infections due to h. influenzae in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections.

AB  == the activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, ro 15-8074 and ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. both were highly active (mic for 90% of the strains tested [mic 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin  and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. there was no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against morganella morganii (in the case of ro 15-8074), enterobacter sp., and citrobacter sp. staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to ro 19-5247 (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), but ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. the protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for ro 19-5247. the major target  site for the two cephalosporins was pbp 3.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  == timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. all patients had neutropenia (pmn less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees c). febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, alkaligenes faecalis, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. one patient had a polymicrobial infection (p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. the mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes  improved. among 11 infections due to gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. the polymicrobial infection also resolved. in only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. these data suggest that the combination of timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  == forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. there were five types of infections. infections commonly associated with a t-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with salmonella species, listeria monocytogenes, cryptococcus neoformans, and histoplasma capsulatum. infections commonly associated with a b-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, staphylococcus aureus, and mixed s. aureus and group g streptococcus. other infections occurring out of  the hospital included those with s. aureus, clostridium perfringens, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group b streptococcus. because two thirds of  the septicemias were caused by organisms other than t-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == eighty hospital patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  associated with haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis or pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated with ciprofloxacin. the patients were divided into four groups of 20 patients each and administered either 500 mg, 750 mg (two different batches of tablets) or 1000 mg twice daily for ten days. most of the patients with haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis infections were treated successfully but the results in patients with streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were less satisfactory. although the ciprofloxacin mics for the latter organisms were relatively low, mean serum and sputum concentrations measured on the first day of treatment did not exceed 2-3 mg/l and 1-2.3 mg/l respectively. the overall clinical results for all dosage regimes were only fair, mainly due to failure to  eradicate streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. adverse effects (nausea, stomach pain or hallucinations) were seen in eight patients, causing treatment to be discontinued in five. it is concluded that ciprofloxacin is only  of limited use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections unless streptococcus pneumoniae is absent.

TI  == in-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  == nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. the 4-quinolones were regularly active (mic90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, different enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, agrobacter spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., neisseria meningitidis. other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, nocardia asteroides, p. maltophilia, achromobacter xylosoxydans and alcaligenes denitrificans. ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. all the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. the mbc/mic ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with streptococcus agalactiae, str. faecalis and l. monocytogenes. a two- to eight-fold increase of mic was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. susceptible bacterial population of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the mic) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the mic). supplementing the media with mgso4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented  agar, with all quinolone or strains. less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with znso4 or ca(no3)2.

AB  == a-56619 and a-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a-56619 and a-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection with salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with a-56619 (50% effective dose [ed50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ed50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). e. coli or pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with a-56619 or a-56620 than with norfloxacin. after oral treatment, the  ed50s of a-56619 and a-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against e. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against e. coli or p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. a-56619 and a-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. a-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and a-56620  was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against klebsiella pneumonia in mice. a-56619 and a-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. a-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas a-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. the peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of a-56619 and a-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. the serum hal-lives of a-56619 and a-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.

TI  == [infections of the central nervous system in malignant hemopathies].
AB  == central nervous system (cns) infections in immunocompromised hosts are often accompanied by subtle disorders because immunosuppression usually decreases the inflammatory response. cns infections in immunocompromised patients are usually caused by organisms different from those found in the general population. the organism causing cns infection in an immunocompromised host can often be predicted if the type of immune abnormality of the patient is known. the common causes of cns infection in immunocompromised hosts are reviewed here. meningitis  in patients with neutropenia is usually due to enteric gram negative bacilli that live in the patient's own digestive tract. pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common  and is followed by e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter and proteus. a major risk in patients with abnormal immunoglobulins or splenectomy is infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis. meningitis caused by any of the encapsulated bacteria can be fulminant. listeria monocytogenes is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in patients with impaired cellular immunity. nocardia asteroides is a leading cause of brain abscess in patients with hematologic malignancy. most patients have evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions. fungi are among the most common organisms involving the cns in immunocompromised hosts. susceptible patients include those with lymphoma or leukemia and those who receive therapies aimed at suppressing delayed hypersensitivity. cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal cause of cns infection in immunocompromised hosts. the primary site of infection is the lung.  spread to the cns is via the blood stream. the clinical course is highly variable: meningitis, meningoencephalitis and focal mass lesions. candida causes  meningitis or meningoencephalitis characterized by multiple small abscesses in neutropenic hosts. organisms reach the cns via the blood stream usually from the  digestive tract or infected intravenous catheters. aspergillus causes brain abscess, cerebral infarction and focal meningitis in patients with neutropenia. the primary infection is in the lung. the parasites that infest the cns of immunocompromised patients are usually those that exploit a t-lymphocyte, mononuclear phagocyte host defect. the most common are toxoplasma gondii and strongyloides stercoralis. there have been a few cases of amebiasis with dissemination to the brain in patients with hematologic malignancies. toxoplasma  gondii causes major cns disease in immunocompromised hosts: meningoencephalitis or mass lesions.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  == cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. in this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men,  6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high  performance liquid chromatography. serum bactericidal activity (sba) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. the mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. at eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. the total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. up to ten hours, the sba of ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. at one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a sba of 1:4 for staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the addition of netilmicin, median sba against staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. netilmicin enhanced  the sba of ceftazidime. the combination was not effective against streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == safety and effectiveness of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium in treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the safety and effectiveness of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium was evaluated in an open study of 43 patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. the mean age of the 28 patients in whom bacteriologic evaluations were possible was 55 years; at least two thirds of the  patients had a history of alcoholism or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. a  pathogen was isolated from sputum samples in 23 patients; five of these 23 also had documented bacteremia. there were five additional cases of bacteremia associated with clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia but with no organisms isolated from sputum cultures. thirty-five pathogens were isolated from the 33 evaluable infection sites, primarily streptococcus pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae. s. pneumoniae was the causative organism in all 10 cases of bacteremia. ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium (3 g of ticarcillin and 100 mg of clavulanic acid) was administered intravenously for a mean of six days. all 35 organisms isolated before treatment were eradicated. in one patient a superinfection with pseudomonas aeruginosa developed after treatment with ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium. a clinical evaluation was possible for 32 of the 33 infection sites; clinical cure was achieved at 31 sites and improvement was seen at the other site. all 43 patients were monitored for adverse reactions  by both clinical observation and laboratory tests. in one patient, reversible thrombocytopenia developed that required discontinuation of ticarcillin plus clavulanate potassium. in another patient, there was a slight decrease in the potassium level during therapy. no systemic adverse reactions occurred, nor was there any instance of local effects associated with the intravenous infusion of the drug.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1983)].
AB  == bacterial isolates from the patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over these 3 years, in collaboration with investigators at 13 hospitals in various parts of japan for the study on frequency of isolation of pathogens among the patients and their drug susceptibilities. possible causative pathogens  mainly isolated from sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract infections during period from september 1983 to march 1984, were collected. the frequency of bacterial isolates from the sputum and their drug susceptibility on h. influenzae among the various pathogens are discussed. the kinds of bacterial species isolated from the patients with respiratory tract infections associated with chronic bronchitis, chronic capillary bronchitis or bronchiectasis and their relative frequency of isolation were as follows; total numbers of bacterial isolates collected from various hospitals were 220 strains in 1981, 168 strains 1982 and 258 strains in 1983. h. influenzae was always isolated with highest frequency of 50.5% in 1981, 45.8% in 1982 and 40.7% in 1983, and followed by p. aeruginosa (24.1%), s. aureus (8.2%), s. pneumoniae (7.3%) and k. pneumoniae (5.9%) and e. coli (4.1%) in 1981; p. aeruginosa (30.4%), s. pneumoniae (11.9%),  s. aureus (4.8%), k. pneumoniae (3.0%) and e. coli (1.8%) in 1982; p. aeruginosa  (26.7%), s. pneumoniae (10.1%), s. aureus (7.8%), k. pneumoniae (3.5%) and e. coli (3.5%) in 1983. the drug susceptibility test of h. influenzae to ampicillin  (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), mezlocillin (mzpc), sulbenicillin (sbpc), gentamicin (gm), amikacin (amk), cefotiam (ctm), cefmetazole (cmz), cefoperazone (cpz), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftizoxime (czx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and latamoxef (lmox) was done by using agar micro-broth dilution methods. h. influenzae was most markedly  susceptible to cephems of the third generation, especially to cmx, czx and ctx by which about 95% of h. influenzae tested were inhibited the growth under the concentration with less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml of the drugs. furthermore, annual changes in susceptibility of h. influenzae to various antibiotics was analyzed over the period from 1981 to 1983. the frequency of s. pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis was about 10% in this survey. however, in the case of respiratory infections associated with bacterial pneumonia, the frequencies were as follows; 24.8% (77 cases/311 cases) in 1981, 17.7% (44 cases/248 cases) in 1982, and 11.0% (39 cases/355 cases) in 1983. the frequency of isolation of s. pneumoniae decreased every year.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel arylfluoroquinolone antibacterial agents.
AB  == a series of novel arylfluoroquinolones has been prepared. these derivatives are characterized by having a fluorine atom at the 6-position, substituted amino groups at the 7-position, and substituted phenyl groups at the 1-position. structure-activity relationship (sar) studies indicate that the in vitro antibacterial potency is greatest when the 1-substituent is either p-fluorophenyl or p-hydroxyphenyl and the 7-substituent is either 1-piperazinyl, 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl, or 3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl. the electronic and spatial properties of the 1-substituent, as well as the steric bulk, play important roles in the antimicrobial potency in this class of antibacterials. as a result of this study, compounds 45 and 41 were found to possess excellent in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy.

TI  == clinical experience with aztreonam in europe: a summary of studies in belgium, england, finland, ireland, the netherlands, norway, portugal, and sweden.
AB  == therapeutic results are given for 342 patients treated with various doses of aztreonam in 20 studies. one hundred sixty-five patients had urinary tract infections; 40 of these patients were bacteremic. favorable clinical response was reported for 91.5% of the patients, and only one bacteremic patient failed to respond to treatment. pneumonia was treated in 99 patients, 11 of whom were bacteremic; 86 responded favorably to treatment. in 22 patients with bacteremia of unknown focus, only one failure was noted. of 368 bacterial isolates, 323 were eliminated during treatment. pseudomonas aeruginosa was eradicated in 28 of 41 infections. adverse reactions were rare and led to discontinuation of aztreonam treatment in only one patient. in 37 patients superinfections with 42 bacterial strains were reported. four of these patients, all of whom were seriously debilitated by underlying conditions, had staphylococcal septicemia and died. one patient developed bacteroides septicemia but recovered. in seven patients with pneumonia, superinfections with streptococcus pneumoniae were reported. the use of aztreonam in combination with antibiotics active against gram-positive and/or  anaerobic organisms should be considered in treatment of infections other than those of the urinary tract.

TI  == a preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in nigeria.
AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

TI  == pefloxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == forty-three patients admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were treated with 400 mg pefloxacin twice daily for ten days.  the first 20 patients were given the first dose of the drug as a 60 min intravenous infusion. serum and sputum concentrations of pefloxacin were measured microbiologically at intervals on the first treatment day and the sputum was cultured before, during, and after the course of pefloxacin. two patients died from unrelated causes during the follow-up and one refused to continue treatment. all strains of haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis were eradicated at end-of-treatment but eight strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and three of pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured and the sputum remained purulent despite the pefloxacin. peak serum concentrations averaged approximately 4.5 mg/l after the infusion and 5 mg/l on oral administration, the corresponding sputum concentrations being 3.8 and 4.6 mg/l, respectively. mics for h. influenzae were  0.06 mg/l, or less. mode mics for the pre- and post-treatment strains of str. pneumoniae were 4 and 16 mg/l, and the corresponding values for ps. aeruginosa were 2 and 16 mg/l. the poor results in pseudomonas and pneumococcal infections could largely be explained by the degree of resistance among these organisms.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of a novel penem fce 22101 compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == fce 22101 is a penem antibiotic which inhibits the majority of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/l. it inhibits staphylococci, haemolytic streptococci  and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species are resistant. bacteroides fragilis and  clostridium species are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 mg/l. fce 22101 is not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chrosmosomal beta-lactamases. it shows minimal discrepancy between mic and mbc values and there is minimal effect of inoculum size. although fce 22101 is generally less active against enterobacteriaceae than are cefotaxime and ceftazidime, it does inhibit some enterobacter spp. resistant to these agents. fce 22101 and imipenem are similar in activity against gram-positive and anaerobic species.

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

AB  == the worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin as of november 7, 1983, in the  intravenous therapy for severe and moderately severe infections of the lower respiratory tract is reviewed. of 204 assessable patients treated in 77 studies conducted by 70 investigative groups (43 in the united states, 27 in other countries), 173 (85%) were cured of their infections or showed improvement. imipenem was tested against 289 of 303 bacterial pathogens isolated before therapy, and 284 (98%) were found to be susceptible. principal pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella species, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. a total of 76% of infecting pathogens were eradicated during therapy. of 54 imipenem-susceptible infecting strains of p. aeruginosa, however, 57% were eradicated, 19% acquired resistance to imipenem, and 17% were replaced by new resistant strains of p. aeruginosa. higher doses of imipenem/cilastatin and/or combined therapy with an aminoglycoside may improve these results. imipenem/cilastatin compares well with  the most active agents available for therapy for lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  == we have used the ability of opsonised bacteria to stimulate luminol enhanced chemiluminescence of human neutrophils to examine the opsonic capabilities of normal and hypogammaglobulinaemic sera for four common bacterial pathogens. preparations of human immunoglobulin modified for i.v. use have then been compared with unmodified cohn fraction ii for their effectiveness in improving opsonization when added to antibody deficient sera in vitro. hypogammaglobulinaemic sera exhibited impaired opsonisation of haemophilus influenzae, and severely antibody deficient sera also opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa poorly. the opsonization of these organisms was improved by cohn fraction ii, and by ph 4 and beta-propionolactone treated immunoglobulins, in descending order of effectiveness. pepsin digested immunoglobulin was inactive, and in some cases impaired opsonic capacity. the opsonisation of staphylococcus aureus by hypogammaglobulinaemic sera was near normal, and was not improved by any immunoglobulin. this technique, which assesses biological activity of immunoglobulin, is useful in comparing preparations, and may help to establish appropriate dosage and frequency for intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

AB  == one hundred patients with infections mostly outside of the urinary tract were studied in a prospective, open manner to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of ciprofloxacin in a variety of clinical situations. there were 41 instances of  bacteremia, including 38 with salmonella typhi, and 21 respiratory, 17 skin and skin structure, 11 bone or joint, 6 gastrointestinal, and 4 urinary tract infections. the patients were given 500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally every 12 h for 2 to 107 days (mean, 15.1 days). microorganisms isolated disclosed susceptibilities comparable to those reported previously, with a mic for 90% of the strains of 0.25 microgram/ml. for streptococcus pneumoniae the mic for 90% of the strains was 0.03 microgram/ml, and it was higher for pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5 microgram/ml), although still in the therapeutic range. levels in blood were lower than those reported in other series, and no accumulation of the drug during treatment was detected. in 88 instances there was resolution of the infectious process, in 7 there was improvement, in 3 there was a failure to respond, and in  2 the clinical response was indeterminate. bacteriological eradication was documented in 87 infections. despite extensive clinical and laboratory examinations before, during, and after therapy, no major abnormalities related to therapy were seen; only one patient required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin due to gastrointestinal intolerance. ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe therapeutic alternative in many tissue infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.

TI  == pneumonia treated with imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  == in an open, prospective, multicenter trial the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia was investigated. forty-three adults were studied: 29 with nosocomial and 14 with community-acquired infections. significant underlying disease was present in 91 percent of patients. nosocomial infection was frequently associated with endotracheal intubation (48 percent), prior antibiotic therapy (48 percent), and  recent surgery (31 percent). most frequent sputum isolates included pseudomonas aeruginosa (10, all nosocomial), hemophilus influenzae (10), escherichia coli (eight), staphylococcus aureus (seven), and streptococcus pneumoniae (six). treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was associated with clinical cure in 93 percent of patients. two of three failures and one superinfection occurred in association with isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem. overall, six of 10 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated prior to therapy developed resistance to imipenem after an average of 10 days of therapy. adverse  effects occurred in nine patients (21 percent) and included one case of pseudomembranous colitis. monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin of serious lower respiratory tract infections was relatively safe and highly effective with the exception of disease associated with p. aeruginosa.

TI  == analysis of thirty-seven cases of pleural empyema.
AB  == a retrospective analysis of 37 pediatric patients with pleural empyema revealed that streptoccoccus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen (41%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (14%). twenty-three patients were treated with  thoracic drainage and systemic antibiotics, and the other 14 patients with antibiotics only. the case fatality ratio (11%), the complication rate (38%), the length of hospital stay, and the number of febrile days did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. the immediate insertion of drainage tubes is probably not indicated in all children with pleural empyema but should be reserved for specific indications.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  == using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas species. unlike many newer beta-lactams, sch 34343 was highly active  against gram-positive species. it was consistently active against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic50 and mic90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). this, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. sch 34343 was the most active compound tested  against bacteroides fragilis. in tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. it had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. it showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at ph values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees c. binding in human plasma was 72%. we concluded  that sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.

TI  == [antibiotic therapy of pneumopathies in intensive care and protected distal bronchial samples].
AB  == bacteriology was performed on 57 specimens collected by the wimberley protected catheter bronchoscopy technique (pcb) from 42 ventilated patients with severe head trauma hospitalized in the neurosurgical intensive care unit to determine the etiology of their pneumopathy. all patients had a nasotracheal tube upon arrival at the intensive care unit. for each sample, smears were examined and cultures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well as with co2 were performed. in 34 (59%) of the 57 cases, examination of smears allowed rapid diagnosis and appropriate chemotherapy. in 47 (82%) cases, culture was positive,  with a single pathogen being recovered in half of cases. the most prevalent organisms among the 75 species isolated were s. aureus (38%), p. aeruginosa (15%), klebsiella (12%), haemophilus (8%), and pneumococcus (9%). consistency with positive cultures of blood or pleural effusion samples was recorded in 92% of cases. narrow spectrum antibiotic therapy can be chosen according to the results of pcb bacteriology and rapid automated antibiotic sensitivity testing obtained within 24 hours. pcb is therefore recommended in pulmonary infections in intensive care units.

TI  == evaluation of gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infection: a preliminary report.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography has been proposed as a possible tool in the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infections. the analysis is based on the identification of specific organic acids derived from bacterial metabolism when organisms are present within the amniotic fluid. we retrospectively subjected 69  samples of amniotic fluid which had been obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. forty-seven samples were derived from patients who either were in premature labor or had premature rupture of membranes with associated premature labor. twenty-two specimens which served as a comparison group were obtained from patients who underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal maturity. the results obtained from chromatographic analysis  are presented, and the possible applications of this technique to the clinical situation are discussed.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == a rat model of bacterial keratitis. effect of antibiotics and corticosteroid.
AB  == a model of bacterial keratitis in rats was developed to quantify the effect of antibiotics and corticosteroid on the infective process. corneas were inoculated  with staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or streptococcus pneumoniae.  the natural history of infection with these organisms was determined. groups of animals received topical antibiotics and prednisolone acetate. the effect of treatment on the number of leukocytes and viable bacteria in the corneas was determined. prednisolone did not influence the effect of the antibiotics; however, steroid treatment alone increased the pseudomonad count as much as 20-fold above the count in untreated eyes. in general, both the antibiotic and steroid treatments were more successful when begun eight hours after infection than when begun at 24 hours. a 1% gentamicin sulfate preparation proved effective against each of the infections, including a pneumococcal strain considered resistant on the basis of in vitro tests.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. the pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against escherichia coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against candida albicans. there was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity was dialyzable and ph dependent, but independent of heat,  the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. electron micrographs of escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. the antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. it is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.

AB  == elastase activity generated during lung defense against aerobic bacteria was studied in an animal model. bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid from hamsters inoculated with bacteria was assayed for elastase activity at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after inoculation using a synthetic substrate of elastase, succinyl-trialanine-nitroanilide (slapn). streptococcus pneumoniae type 25 inoculation led to a peak elastase activity of 0.72 +/- 0.27 x 10(-3) units, not  significantly different from baseline (0.41 +/- 0.08 x 10(-3) units) or saline control (0.33 +/- 0.18 x 10(-3) units). in contrast, inoculation with pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pao-1 (a species known to produce elastase as well as other virulence factors) produced peak elastase activity of 3.0 +/- 1.2 x 10(-3) units  in bal fluid, significantly higher than either pneumococcus type 25 or saline control (p less than 0.025). inoculation with pseudomonas aeruginosa strain e-64, an isogenic mutant of pao-1 that produces a nonfunctional elastase, led to peak levels similar to the pao-1 strain, suggesting that the presence of bacterial elastase was not the primary factor in bal fluid elastase activity. total numbers of granulocytes in bal fluid from pneumococcus-inoculated animals (144 +/- 31 x 10(6] was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than from either the pao-1 (74  +/- 31 x 10(6] or e-64 (99 +/- 27 x 10(6] strains of pseudomonas, use of selective enzyme inhibitors of elastase, diisopropyl fluorophosphate and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, implied that the majority of elastase activity in bal fluid was due to a serine protease, of which granulocyte elastase is the primary source.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aztreonam in patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: failure to prevent emergence of pneumococcal infections.
AB  == a group of 36 patients, all requiring hospital admission because of acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, were treated with 1 or 2 g intramuscular injections of aztreonam for ten days. patients with streptococcus pneumoniae infections were excluded from the study. sputum cultures before treatment revealed the other usual respiratory pathogens but repeat cultures on days 3, 10 and 17 sometimes yielded str. pneumoniae, occasionally combined with haemophilus influenzae or branhamella catarrhalis. ten patients had to be given other antimicrobial agents for str. pneumoniae infections which developed during  the study or follow-up periods. pseudomonas aeruginosa failed to respond well to  aztreonam. all the h. influenzae strains were sensitive to aztreonam (mic 0.25 mg/l, or less) but all strains of str. pneumoniae were resistant (mic greater than 32 mg/l). ps. aeruginosa strains were moderately resistant (mic generally 4-16 mg/l) and bran. catarrhalis strains only moderately sensitive (mics generally 0.5-4 mg/l). peak serum concentrations averaging approximately 37 mg/l  were observed after the 1 g injections (55 mg/l after 2 g) and the corresponding  mean peak concentrations in the sputum were 1.3 mg/l and 2.5 mg/l, respectively.  the penetration from blood to sputum was thus approximately 3.5% and 4.6% after the 1 g and 2 g doses. no unwanted local or general reactions were observed. the  disappointing clinical results (only 23 out of 36 patients with excellent or good clinical results) one week after the end of the treatment were mainly due to the  emergence of pneumococcal infections during (and immediately after) therapy. considering that str. pneumoniae is still one of the most important organisms associated with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and that conventional sputum cultures may not always reveal its presence, there is considerable doubt if aztreonam has any place in the treatment, especially as the results in ps. aeruginosa infections have also been much poorer than expected.

AB  == the results of a large three centre co-ordinated study into the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial clinical pathogens showed no significant evidence of  regional variation within the u.k. towards the 10 antibiotics examined. the newer cephalosporins were highly potent and superior to other antibiotics against the enterobacteriaceae, with ceftriaxone and cefotaxime the most potent. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, gentamicin was the most active, followed by ceftazidime,  piperacillin and ceftriaxone; cefotetan was the least active. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus albus were most susceptible to cefuroxime and gentamicin, though most were also susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefoxitin. streptococcus (groups a and b), streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria spp. were susceptible to most agents other than gentamicin, but ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were overall the most potent. ceftriaxone was the most active agent against haemophilus influenzae. the newer agents were variable and relatively poor against anaerobes and only amoxycillin and piperacillin were significantly active against streptococcus faecalis. the overall resistance level to the third  generation cephalosporins was low.

TI  == a multicenter comparison of related pharmacologic features of cephalexin and dicloxacillin given for two months to young children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == twenty-one cystic fibrosis patients under 3 years of age were enrolled in an open multicenter study to assess the feasibility of the study design and to compare selected pharmacologic features of cephalexin or dicloxacillin administered orally for 2 months. patient tolerance and compliance were significantly less for dicloxacillin (p less than .01 and p less than .001, respectively). superficial candida infections were more common in the cephalexin group (p = 0.02), however increased stool frequency and nonspecific diaper rashes were more prevalent in patients receiving dicloxacillin (p less than .05). staphylococcus aureus was isolated from respiratory secretions after 2 months from two dicloxacillin and no cephalexin patients. areas under the curve and peak serum concentrations were higher for cephalexin (p less than .05 and p = .02), but antistaphylococcal activity in serum was higher for dicloxacillin (p less than .05) due to a lower mean mic compared to cephalexin. deep pharyngeal plus routine throat culture yielded more pathogens than either method alone. express mail and central processing of respiratory specimens was efficient for most organisms, however there was some loss of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. cephalexin was associated with better patient acceptance and compliance despite higher rates of superficial fungal infections as compared to dicloxacillin. cephalexin, routine bacteriologic throat swabs processed locally or centrally, mail-in urine compliance assessment and a multicenter design are feasible components for a long-term prospective evaluation of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cystic fibrosis.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

TI  == temocillin treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit.
AB  == in a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. the patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. in addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency,  and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. the infections included septicaemia  (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). the most frequent bacterial isolate was escherichia coli (14), followed by enterobacter cloacae (5), proteus spp. (5) and klebsiella pneumoniae (4). the initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. in the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. all of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. superinfection with streptococcus group d,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. the emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of e. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of k. pneumoniae. no adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled gram-negative infection.

AB  == crude ribosomes were isolated from listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b and separated into two fractions by molecular sieve chromatography. chemical analysis indicated that fraction i contained cell envelope components while fraction ii contained the ribosomes. both fractions protected mice against listeria, but only in combination with the adjuvant dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (dda). rnase-treatment, but not proteinase k-treatment destroyed the protective properties of fraction ii, and rna purified from fraction ii also induced protection. protection induced by fraction i was not affected by either rnase- or proteinase k-treatment. both subcutaneous and intraperitoneal, but not intravenous administration of fraction i, fraction ii, or purified rna induced significant protection against intraperitoneal infection, the intraperitoneal route of administration being the most effective. all preparations induced high levels of protection 3 to 7 days after administration, but protection was already decreased after 14 days. protection induced with rna appeared to be biphasic, because it also protected mice 1 day, but not 2 days after administration. protection induced with both fraction i and rna was at least in part non-specific, because both preparations also protected mice against l. monocytogenes serotype 3, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results are discussed in relation to previous work with analogous preparations from p. aeruginosa.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and experimental data on beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of patients.
AB  == the in vitro and animal model studies on optimal dosage of the newer beta-lactams are summarized and put into historical perspective. they provide a rationale for  dosage schedules that continuously maintain inhibitory serum and tissue concentrations throughout the dosage interval. in vitro studies on the post-antibiotic effect (pae) with beta-lactams revealed only short time periods of post-antibiotic growth suppression with gram-positive cocci and no post-antibiotic effect with gram-negative bacilli. a similar lack of persistent growth suppression was observed with beta-lactams in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in the same animal model, dosing regimens of beta-lactams which continuously provided serum concentrations above the mic were more efficacious than those that did not. the newer third-generation cephalosporins have prolonged half-lives and can maintain  serum levels above the mic for most pathogens, even when dosed at widely spaced intervals.

TI  == the relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  == one potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. between july 1, 1981, and march 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean,  elective arterial reconstructive procedures. control cultures were obtained from  adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0  of 20) (p less than 0.001). the most common organism cultured was staphylococcus  epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). our overall graft infection rate since january 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). all three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). these patients with culture-positive graft infections  were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with  negative arterial cultures. positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). these data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.

TI  == enoxacin-induced alteration of susceptibility of pneumococci and pseudomonas to phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == this report examines the effects of exposure to enoxacin on interactions of bacteria and neutrophils. pretreatment of streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa with x 1/2 to x4 the mic of enoxacin had no enhancing effect upon phagocytic killing when the antibiotic was not present. phagocytic killing was synergistically enhanced when enoxacin was continually present although this was not manifested in increased phagocytosis. the enhanced killing  was abrogated by disruption of bacterial opsonization, internalization and intraleukocytic killing processes of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. these observations indicate that the synergistic killing of str. pneumoniae and ps. aeruginosa by enoxacin and human neutrophils is due to enhanced intracellular killing and not an increase in phagocytosis.

TI  == changing patterns of hospital infections: implications for therapy. changing mechanisms of bacterial resistance.
AB  == during the past decade there has been a marked increase in resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. microorganisms have developed the ability to make altered receptors for antimicrobial agents, have prevented agents from reaching their receptors within the bacterial cell, now have enzymes to destroy antibiotics, and have resistant metabolic pathways. altered penicillin receptors, penicillin-binding proteins, have been found in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, clostridium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. resistance based on decreased entry of drugs has been found for penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines in the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. beta-lactamase resistance has increased significantly being encountered in neisseria, haemophilus, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas species. chromosomal  inducible beta-lactamases, which function as cephalosporinases, have been a particular problem in enterobacter and citrobacter species, and organisms resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins have been isolated from patients. it is clear that beta-lactamases and changes in cell wall permeability  will play an extremely important role in the future of the new penicillins and cephalosporins.

AB  == the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime (hr 221), a new  cephalosporin, were compared with those of other cephem antibiotics. hr 221 was highly active against gram-negative bacteria. the compound inhibited growth of all tested haemophilus influenzae strains at 0.10 microgram/ml and showed strong  activity even against penicillin-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, but it  was less effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other antibiotics tested. against gram-positive bacteria, hr 221 showed 100% inhibition of growth of streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, and it was slightly less active against staphylococcus aureus (mic90:12.5 micrograms/ml) than other antibiotics such as cefotaxime (ctx). the bactericidal activity of hr 221 against e. coli was dose-related and comparable to that of ctx, cefoperazone and latamoxef. the bactericidal activity of the compound at medium concentrations simulating human serum levels was higher than that of ctx and cefmetazole, and no cell regrowth was noted after beta-lactamase-induced inactivation of the compound. hr 221 was stable to most drug-inactivating enzyme preparations from various bacterial species.

TI  == an extended model for transfer of micro-organisms via the hands: differences between organisms and the effect of alcohol disinfection.
AB  == a model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. the ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as  was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. there were differences between the species. staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes and serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. these results  were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of escherichia coli and one of streptococcus pyogenes. the contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. an alcohol  handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).

TI  == low levels of functional of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor in the promotion of c3-cleavage by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyema.
AB  == it has been suggested that c3 breakdown by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyemas may be related to a decreased inhibitor potential for these enzymes. in the present study it was shown that in 17 infected pleural effusions, high proteolytic activity on 125i-labeled c3 (16.3% +/- 4.4%) correlated with low functional levels of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-pi), as determined by  trypsin-inhibitory capacity (56.2 +/- 20.1 iu/ml; rs = -0.97, p less than .001),  whereas in 18 sterile pleural effusions there was no such correlation (125i-labeled c3 cleavage, 2.2% +/- .2%; trypsin-inhibitory capacity, 192.6 +/- 26.7 iu/ml). however, alpha 1-pi and alpha 2-macroglobulin protein concentrations in infected and sterile effusions (as measured by immunodiffusion) were similar.  fifteen strains of three bacterial species--streptococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis--isolated from patients with pneumonia or empyema inactivated the elastase-inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-pi in vitro. these results show that in empyemas functional levels of alpha 1-pi were too low  to inactivate granulocyte elastase and that some bacterial species may contribute to the low inhibitor potential of infected pleural fluid by direct alpha 1-pi inactivation.

TI  == current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  == the mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. most resistance currently seen is the  result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. however, extensive use  of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. s. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. streptococcus fecalis has  become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol  transacetylase has been encountered. beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of serratia marcescens and pseudomonas  aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

TI  == symposium on infectious complications of neoplastic disease (part ii). immunoprophylaxis and serotherapy of bacterial infections.
AB  == immunologic approaches to the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections date back to the antecedent century. recent interest and controversy has centered about the efficacy of gram-negative bacillary vaccines, antiserum against endotoxin, and pneumococcal vaccines. immunization of cancer patients with pseudomonas lipopolysaccharide vaccines has yielded inconsistent results. factors limiting the further application of this approach are the poor immune responses in neutropenic patients and the marked pyrogenicity and pain associated with vaccine administration. similarly, patients being treated for neoplasms of the hematopoietic system are not likely to show good antibody responses to pneumococcal antigens, even though they are not toxic. pneumococcal immunization  appears to be effective, at least as measured in terms of antibody titers, in those patients with lymphoma who have not undergone splenectomy and are not receiving chemotherapy at the time of immunization. the most reliable approach towards immunoprophylaxis may be the passive one, with antibody being produced in normal donors. the antibodies are short-lived, and this type of prophylaxis still needs to be evaluated in controlled trials. in a recently completed controlled therapeutic trial, the therapeutic application of an antiserum against core endotoxin antigens resulted in a significant reduction in deaths and increased recovery from shock complicating gram-negative sepsis. however, antiserum failed  to protect cancer patients or neutropenic subjects.

TI  == selective media for the quantitation of bacteria in cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  == we used selective media together with aerobic and anaerobic incubation for the quantitation of common pathogens in liquefied sputum from children with cystic fibrosis. the accuracy of the technique was verified by reconstruction studies in which laboratory strains with antibiotic-resistance markers were added to sputum  from cystic fibrosis patients. comparison of the numbers of bacteria found on quantitative culture of clinical specimens with the "predominant" organism found  on routine culture yielded a poor correlation. when pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prevalent on routine culture, it was present in the highest numbers on quantitative culture (mean count = 10(8) cfu/g). however, large numbers of haemophilus influenzae (mean count = 10(7) cfu/g), staphylococcus aureus (mean count = 2 x 10(6) cfu/g), and streptococci (mean count = 2 x 10(6) cfu/g) were also present in these cultures. when s. aureus was the predominant organism, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa were also present in similar numbers (c. 10(7) cfu/g). when h. influenzae was the predominant species on routine culture, the mean count was 7 x 10(6) cfu/g and p. aeruginosa was often completely absent. we  conclude that the selective technique permits reliable enumeration of sputum bacteria, and offers a more accurate assessment of the microbial flora of sputum  in cystic fibrosis than does simple plating of unhomogenised sputum.

TI  == chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == phagocytosis of the legionnaires' disease bacterium (legionella pneumophila) occurs by a novel mechanism: engulfment within a pseudopod coil.
AB  == phagocytosis of legionella pneumophila, a bacterial pathogen that multiplies intracellularly in human mononuclear phagocytes and causes legionnaires' disease, occurs by a novel mechanism. a phagocyte pseudopod coils around the bacterium as  the organism is internalized. human monocytes, alveolar macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes all phagocytize l. pneumophila by this unusual process, termed "coiling phagocytosis," and these leukocytes phagocytize not only live l. pneumophila in this way, but also formalin-killed, glutaraldehyde-killed, and heat-killed l. pneumophila. in contrast, under the same experimental conditions, monocytes phagocytize streptococcus pneumoniae, encapsulated and unencapsulated e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas alcaligenes, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis by conventional phagocytosis. treatment of l. pneumophila with high-titer anti-l. pneumophila antibody abolishes coiling phagocytosis; such bacteria are internalized by conventional phagocytosis. these experiments raise the possibility that a surface component of l. pneumophila mediates the unusual response by the phagocyte. such a component,  if elaborated in vivo, might be responsible for extrapulmonary manifestations of  legionnaires' disease suspected of being toxin-mediated.

AB  == in vitro susceptibility of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, hemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. in general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria gonorrhea. they also tend to be active against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis. however, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. these cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.

TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  == cefpiramide (cpm, sm-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. antibacterial activities of cpm against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis and proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (cpz). antibacterial activities of cpm against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of cpz, but antibacterial activity of  cpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of cpz and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. antibacterial activity of cpm has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (pcase type) producing s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, etc. it is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of cpm against pathogenic organisms but also the  beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of cpm.

TI  == is treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis with intramuscular mezlocillin justifiable?
AB  == a group of patients admitted to hospital with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis was treated with two daily injections of 1 or 2 g mezlocillin  intramuscularly for ten days, 19 patients receiving 1 g and 17 the 2 g doses. serum and sputum mezlocillin concentrations were measured microbiologically on the first treatment day. the peak serum levels averaged 23 mg/l after 1 g and 34  mg/l after 2 g, and the corresponding average sputum peak concentrations were 0.78 and 1.26 mg/l respectively. fourteen of the 36 patients had infections associated with beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and nine of the positive cultures on the last treatment day also showed beta-lactamase producers to be present. most of the mics for the sensitive bacteria were of the order of 2-4 mg/l, but the mics for the pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were greater than 16 mg/l. mezlocillin was relatively inactive against many of the common respiratory  pathogens--even when these were not beta-lactamase producers--by virtue of poor penetration.

TI  == nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  == during a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. the annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. the most frequent pathogens were escherichia coli  (24 per cent), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. the burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). the plastic surgery service had more serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more escherichia  coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. more than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. estimates were made of the economic  benefits of successful control programs.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  == the bactec resin-containing blood culture bottle (16b; johnston laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. however, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. this in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16b to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16b and the 6b (conventional aerobic) bottles. the studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16b bottles. low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly.  the indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. the failure of the bactec 16b blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.

AB  == sera from populations of normal adults and children as well as sera from children with systemic haemophilus influenzae type b disease were tested for antibodies reacting with ribosomes from h. influenzae type b. adults generally had high titers of antibody, with 90% having titers greater than 1:64. the distribution of titers approximated a normal curve. among normal children, there was more variability between individual titers, with the median titers ranging between 1:64 and 1:128. in contrast, acute-phase sera from children with systemic h. influenzae type b disease all had titers of 1:16 or less. two convalescent-phase  sera had high titers. absorption experiments ruled out cross-reaction between ribosomes and type b capsular material. ribosomes from two unrelated type b strains were completely cross-reactive, whereas absorption with ribosomes from a  type c strain led to significantly decreased titers in three of four sera. absorption of sera with ribosomes from pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae also decreased titers, indicating that these antibodies may have been  induced by ribosomes of other bacteria.

AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == cefoperazone: a review of its antimicrobial spectrum, beta-lactamase stability, enzyme inhibition, and other in vitro characteristics.
AB  == the in vitro qualities of cefoperazone were reviewed on the basis of international medical literature and some new observations. cefoperazone is highly active against the enterobacteriaceae. its activity against staphylococcus aureus is comparable to that of the other newer cephem antibiotics. cefoperazone  is also active against all beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae and is relatively inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci. against pseudomonas aeruginosa cefoperazone is at least fourfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam and is approximately as active as azlocillin or piperacillin. haemophilus and neisseria species, regardless of beta-lactamase production, are highly susceptible to cefoperazone. against the bacteroides fragilis group, cefoperazone is either very active or quite inactive  because of endemic variations. the drug is slightly less stable to some beta-lactamases than are cefotaxime-like or 7-methoxy cephem drugs. cefoperazone  is a bactericidal beta-lactam, and its minimal inhibitory concentrations are influenced only by high inoculum concentrations of beta-lactamase-producing strains. its ability to permeate bacterial cell membranes appears similar to that of cefotaxime. synergy studies with cefoperazone plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or aminoglycosides against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa show enhanced killing. cefoperazone is 70%-94% protein bound and has high affinities for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins 3, 1a, 2, and 1 bs.

AB  == five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. the isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including clostridium species, often represented contamination. more than 99% of  all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. the five most common isolates were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; s. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi  were especially common nosocomial pathogens. the microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. the most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. after antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.

TI  == general principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == the initial treatment of suspected life-threatening bacterial infection should be sufficiently broad to cover the likely causative agents. definitive therapy depends on microbial isolation, identification, and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. parenteral therapy should be used, at least initially, and  optimal doses are necessary. the dose is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered; a concern for potential side effects with use of these agents had engendered a tendency to administer inadequate doses. the problems leading to recurrence or persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group  d streptococci, and cryptococcus neoformans. laboratory assistance for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be valuable but is not always necessary because certain microorganisms--for example, streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes--have stable, predictable susceptibilities. cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == the effects of splenectomy and splenic implantation on alveolar macrophage function.
AB  == the effect of splenectomy on the ability of alveolar macrophages of young and adult rats to phagocytize pneumococci, types 3 and 14, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. young animals showed a significant (15%) decrease in the phagocytosis of pneumococci type 14, 4 weeks after splenectomy. this depression increased to 30% in 6 weeks' time. such depression was also noted when young splenectomized rat alveolar macrophages were challenged with pseudomonas aeruginosa but not with type 3 pneumococci 6 weeks postsplenectomy. three months  following splenectomy in young animals, the rats were grown and they seemed to regain their normal phagocytic activity against pneumococci type 14. adult rats also showed no alteration in their phagocytic activity against type 3 pneumococci. autoimplantation of the spleen had a protective effect on the phagocytosis of type 14 pneumococci, and a nonsignificant effect on that of type  3. the present study postulates a modulatory role of the spleen on alveolar macrophage function. splenectomy may cause the impairment of local lower respiratory immune function, making lungs vulnerable to specific bacterial invasion. such splenic modulatory effect on alveolar macrophage phagocytic function seems to be age and antigen specific.

AB  == cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for  the treatment of respiratory infections. this bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in  the treatment of respiratory infections. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae 53, haemophilus influenzae 64, klebsiella pneumoniae 43, escherichia coli 9, enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of  60 pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. in vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. in 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. from these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.

AB  == the efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. the first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. a total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. in the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. the efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (p = 0.03). favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to proteus, enterobacter, and klebsiella species. cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. all serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for  pseudomonas isolates was wide.

TI  == ceftriaxone: in vitro activity against 410 bacterial isolates compared with cefotaxime.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the two new cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone,  against 410 bacterial isolates was compared using an agar dilution method. both compounds were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus and providencia; the great majority of the isolates were  inhibited by 0.06 mg/l of either drug. activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus was moderate, and enterococci were resistant. all streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to 0.03 mg/l of either drug. the isolates belonging to  the bacteroides fragilis group were inhibited over a wide range of concentrations and some were highly resistant (mic greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). there were no significant differences in the antibacterial activity of the two drugs against our isolates. both drugs may be of potential use in the treatment of serious infections caused by enterobacteriaceae; they may prove to be a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides.

TI  == circulating immune complexes in cystic fibrosis.
AB  == the presence or absence of circulating immune complexes (cic) was studied longitudinally over a period of 15 months in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis. (cf). using the raji cell assay, cic were found in 47% of patients. presence of immune complexes did not correlate with age at midpoint of the study severity of  disease, acute pulmonary exacerbations, progression of lung disease, or nonspecific, humoral and cellular immune functions. in addition, the presence of  cic did not correlate with colonization with pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, hemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus species (viridans  or pneumoniae). because cic were present in patients without concurrent sputum colonization with pseudomonas aeruginosa, antigens other than components of this  organism may be capable of forming cic in cf. the clinical and pathologic significant of cic in cf remains to be determined.

TI  == comparative review of two new wide-spectrum penicillins: mezlocillin and piperacillin.
AB  == the antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (mezlin) and piperacillin (pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. following  i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. however, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. piperacillin is also effective for bone and  joint infections. dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. the potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their  extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. more comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.

TI  == rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == rapid identification of haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (glc) of the metabolic by-products in  broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in new zealand white male rabbits. these results were correlated with the glc of csf of meningitis patients. a major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including h. influenzae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and listeria monocytogenes. succinic acid was also found in the csf of experimental meningitis and in the csf of all patients with h. influenzae and  esch. coli meningitis. this peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. it was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria meningitidis. succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in h. influenzae meningitis for at  least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. in one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by glc in the csf excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests h. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.

TI  == moxalactam penetration into cerebrospinal fluid in patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == penetration of moxalactam into the cerebrospinal fluid was studied in 11 patients with bacterial meningitis undergoing treatment with other antibiotics. moxalactam at a dose of 20 mg/kg was administered as three 30- to 45- min infusions at 8-h intervals, once between days 2 and 4 and a second time between days 11 and 20 of  treatment with the other antibiotics. serum and cerebrospinal fluid were sampled  60, 90, or 120 min after the third moxalactam dose for measurement of the concentration of this drug by high-performance liquid chromatography. the concentration of moxalactam in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 1.5 to 11 micrograms/ml, depending on the sampling time and the time elapsed since the onset of the disease. these concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid were equal to or higher than the minimum inhibitor concentrations for neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant  strains), and most of the gram-negative bacilli except for pseudomonas aeruginosa. these results show that moxalactam has good penetrability when the meninges are inflamed and that it might be considered in cases of bacterial meningitis when the susceptibility of the pathogen indicates its usefulness.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime  required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to  8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited  78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics  for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae  and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. variation in ph, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. in escherichia coli cefmenoxime  showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (pbp-3), followed by pbp-1 (1a and 1b). this affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. the high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by proteus mirabilis.

TI  == bb-k 122: in vitro and in vivo activity against ocular pathogens.
AB  == bb-k 122 is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic and an analogue of amikacin. this study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of bb-k 122 and gentamicin against important ocular pathogens. bb-k 122 and gentamicin demonstrated generally equivalent in vitro antibacterial activity, except that gentamicin was  more active against streptococcus sp. bb-k 122 showed significant in vitro activity against important ophthalmic pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and species of klebsiella, escherichia, proteus, haemophilus, and moraxella. solutions of bb-k 122 (1%) and gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) were compared in an experimentally induced rabbit keratoconjunctivitis model. rabbit eyes infected with p. aeruginosa or s.  pneumoniae were treated with one of the two antibiotic formulations and evaluated after 24 h. a topical formulation of 1% bb-k 122 was at least as effective as gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) solution against these infections.

TI  == postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  == persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. the persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. with gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. with gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. inhibitors of protein and rna synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa. the duration of the  postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration  of exposure up to a point of maximal response. persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.

TI  == phosphonopeptide antibacterial agents related to alafosfalin: design, synthesis,  and structure-activity relationships.
AB  == dipeptide variants of alafosfalin (l-alanyl-l-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid) with substantial differences in potency and antibacterial spectrum in vitro and in vivo have been synthesized. certain dipeptides with alternatives to the l-alanyl  residue had broader antibacterial spectra; activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa was included. some compounds had better in vivo activity than alafosfalin when introduced into infected rodents orally, but for the majority of the more active phosphonodipeptides, parenteral administration was more effective. certain oligopeptides derived from the more active phosphonodipeptides possessed good in vitro activity against an extended range of organisms; they included haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vivo activity of some of these phosphono-oligopeptides was significantly greater than that of the parent dipeptide and correlated well with  the in vitro results. this indicates that phosphono-oligopeptides exert part of their in vivo action directly, in addition to that arising from smaller peptides  produced by peptidase cleavage.

TI  == protective effects of s-sulfonated human gamma globulin against experimental infections in mice.
AB  == s-sulfonated gamma globulin (ggs), newly developed as a safe drug for intravenous use, was studied for its protective effects against some experimental infections  in mice. gamma globulin showed a good protective activity against infections due  to streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli and was moderately active against infections due to staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in most cases, the potency of ggs was almost the same as that of original native gamma globulin. the duration of ggs activity in vivo was found to be comparable to that of native gamma globulin and much higher than that of pepsin-digested gamma globulin. in the control of infection due to e. coli, specific antibody was found to play a central role in the antibacterial action of ggs. when ggs was administered in combination with the antibiotics gentamicin and cefazolin for the control of infections due to s. pneumoniae or e. coli, a clear synergistic effect was observed.

AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 antigen.
AB  == an indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the polysaccharide antigen of type 3 pneumococcus (sss-iii) is reported. polystyrene  balls with attached anti-sss-iii antibody serve as the solid phase, and antigen is detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antiglobulin conjugate. the reaction is quantitated by spectrophotometry. concentrations of antigen are estimated by comparison with standard curves prepared with purified sss-iii. for  this assay, the practical lower limit of detection of sss-iii is approximately 2  to 3 ng/ml, thus making the test sensitivity about 25 times that reported for counterimmunoelectrophoresis. in preliminary tests with simulated human clinical  specimens, none of the body fluids tested (spinal fluid, serum, urine, and sputum) interfered with detection of antigen, nor did they produce false-positive or false-negative results. streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 whole organisms were readily detected in simulated clinically positive sputum specimens. cross-reactions were not observed with haemophilus influenzae type b, group b streptococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == bactericidal activity of human lactoferrin: sensitivity of a variety of microorganisms.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that has been detected in secretions that  bathe human mucosal tissues. previous studies have shown that, when this protein  is in the iron-free state, it is capable of a direct bactericidal effect on streptococcus mutans and vibrio cholerae. the present study demonstrates variable susceptibilities for a variety of different microorganisms. the list of susceptible organisms includes gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, rods and cocci, facultative anaerobes, and aerotolerant anaerobes. similar morphological and physiological types are represented among the lalctoferrin-resistant bacteria. s. mutans was more resistant to lactoferrin when grown on a sucrose-contaning medium than when it was grown on brain heart infusion broth without added scurose. when a lactoferrin-sensitive, avirulent strain of streptococcus pneumoniae was passed through mice, the resultant virulent culture  became lactoferrin resistant. since organisms of the same species and even of the same strain (s. pneumoniae) can differ in susceptibility to lactoferrin, it appears that accessibility to the lactoferrin target site may account for differences in susceptibility. it appears that there may be a relation between virulence and resistance to lactoferrin.

TI  == abnormal colonization of neonates in an icu: conversion to normal colonization by pharyngeal implantation of alpha hemolytic streptococcus strain 215.
AB  == normal bacterial flora provide a natural defense mechanism against infection. our experience indicates that "normal" flora for the icu neonate contains alpha hemolytic (alpha-) streptococci as the predominant organism. the purpose of the current investigation is to study the feasibility of implanting a carefully selected, naturally occurring strain of alpha-streptococcus in the nasopharynx of neonates considered to be at high risk of infection because of the abnormal colonization of their pharynx with potential pathogens. twenty-two infants in the neonatal intensive care unit have received nasopharyngeal implantation with strain 215 alpha-streptococcus. in 16 infants, alpha-streptococci, including the  implant strain in pure or mixed alpha-streptococcal populations, constituted the  predominant pharyngeal flora within 48 to 72 hr of implantation. the implant strain was not recovered from the remaining six infants. the procedure was apparently innocuous in this small number of patients. we conclude that implantation of a streptococcus can be established in the pharynx of infants abnormally colonized with pathogenic organisms in high titer and that successful  implantation of strain 215 can result in prompt development of normal pharyngeal  flora, with alpha-streptococci predominant, within 48 hr. there has been no evidence of infection or other adverse reaction caused by the implant strain.

AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  == we report the development and testing of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with excellent sensitivity for the detection of haemophilus influenzae type b (hi(b)) antigen in clinical specimens from patients with hi(b) meningitis. the assay, an indirect sandwich technique, uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-hi(b) antiserum, and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin, together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified hi(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. the assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria meningitidis, and listeria monocytogenes. in preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens, 2 serum specimens, and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved hi(b) meningitis, antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from  1 to 7,000 ng/ml. antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which  were culture negative for hi(b), including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than hi(b). the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and, based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens, may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis. it seems, therefore, to hold considerable promise for clinical use in rapid detection of systemic hi(b) infections.

AB  == rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing triton x-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. the most sensitive method was broth culture. by microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. by micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically  easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.

TI  == minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the minimal antibiotic concentration (mac) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight  times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to 1/128 of the mic. colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the mic was determined, and the mic:mac ratio,  which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. the mic:mac ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. there is no relation between the mics and the mic:mac ratios. the highest ratios were given by proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (mic:mac mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis (mic:mac means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

AB  == the in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. when pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. the rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for e. coli, p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa, and klebsiella spp. increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. the effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. the isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, and enterococci. however, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for p. aeruginosa and enterococci.

TI  == ceforanide (bl-s786) in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == ceforanide (bl-s 786) is a new long-acting parenteral cephalosporin which has the major pharmacologic advantage of requiring only twice a day dosage. we treated 28 adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia using doses of 500 or  1000 mg every 12 hours. twenty-four of 28 infections were due to streptococcus pneumoniae and/or hemophilus influenzae, and all pathogens were susceptible in vitro to both cephalothin and ceforanide. patients were treated for a mean of 7.5 days, and all showed a good clinical and radiographic response with no mortality. of the 13 patients with h. influenzae, the organism could still be recovered during therapy in 9/12 and post therapy in 3/8. one clinical superinfection (sepsis due to pseudomonas aeruginosa) occurred during therapy. side effects with therapy included thrombocytosis (15), asymptomatic eosinophilia (5), and mild elevation of the serum transaminases (3). these studies suggest that ceforanide is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of adult patients with bacterial  pneumonia due to s. pneumoniae; further experience in therapy of h. influenzae is needed because of frequent failure of ceforanide to eradicate this organism from  the sputum.

AB  == we have investigated the effect of hypocomplementemia on early pulmonary clearance of four species of bacteria. the experiments were performed in an inbred animal model to minimize immunologic variability. complement was depleted  by cobra venom factor, and activity in serum was monitored with a phagocytic assay. bacterial specific antibodies were examined by an indirect radioimmunoassay, and animals with high levels of activity were excluded from anaysis. 4 h after aerosolization with streptococcus pneumoniae, complement-depleted animals had cleared only 75% of the initial number of organisms, whereas saline-treated controls cleared 91% (p less than 0.01). aerosolization with pseudomonas aeruginosa was followed at 4 h by a twofold greater growth of organisms in the complement-depleted animals (446% of original  deposition) as compared to the saline-treated controls (211% of original deposition) (p less than 0.02). clearance of klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were similar in complement-depleted animals and saline-treated controls. these experiments suggest that hypocomplementemia predisposes to bacterial pneumonia and may explain the high incidence of pulmonary infections in patients having impaired complement activity. our results further indicate that varying defense mechanisms may be involved with clearing the lung of differing bacterial species.

TI  == general principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == in the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause  is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to  definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. in severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. the need for optimal dosage is emphasized. this is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. the problems leading to recurrence  and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe  infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group d streptococci, klebsiella pneumoniae, and cryptococcus neoformans. laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == [microbial resistance to formaldehyde. i. comparative quantitative studies in some selected species of vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, bacteriophages and viruses].
AB  == the resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. as test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella paratyphi-b, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (bacillus cereus, bacillus pumilus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis), fungi (aspergillus niger, candida albicans), bacteriophages (escherichia coli phages, t1, t2, t3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). for the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees c) and ph  (7.0). the microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (n/n0); where: n0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; n equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). for all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. in all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella paratyphi-b  were found to be more susceptible than staphylococcus aureus (vf. fig. 1 a). the  strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. to obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa. all strains of klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than staphylococcus aureus. in the case of streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. for the killing of candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than  those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. the conidia of aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of staphylococcus aureus (see fig. 1 b). in the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. if the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees c, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. fig. 2a and fig. 2b). the spores of bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. to reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation  to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...

TI  == susceptibility of recently isolated bacteria to amikacin in vitro: comparisons with four other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  == in vitro tests for susceptibility to amikacin and to four other aminoglycoside antibiotics were carried out with strains of many bacterial species by use of an  agar dilution method and an inocula replicator. in general, amikacin was as active as or more active against most of the organims than kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin; in particular, amikacin was active against strains resistant to one or more of these three antibiotics. amikacin was more active than gentamicin  against strains of nocardia asteroides and providencia stuartii and also against  gentamicin-resistant strains of some other gram-negative bacilli, notably serratia marcescens. however, gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most of the other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that were tested. in comparative tests of four media, minimal inhibitory concentrations mics) were greater in tests with mueller-hinton agar, and generally somewhat lower in those  with heart infusion agar, than in tests with trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar. inocula of a 1:1,000 dilution of culture generally gave mics lower than those obtained with undiluted cultures; the differences were small with enterococci, but they were greater with amikacin than with gentamicin in tests on strains of klebsiella pneumoniae. these findings generally confirm those previously reported by others.

TI  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin c derivative i. in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6r,7r)-8-oxo-7[2-(1h-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris. the activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of p. mirabilis. the in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both s. aureus and e. coli. the development in vitro  of resistance by s. aureus 209p and e. coli nihj to ceftezole after 16 transfers  was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. ceftezole was  relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with  streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae or p. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. however, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with s. aureus.

TI  == factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  == the effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus aureus (smith), serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. with p. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum  agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. passive immunity against p. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized p. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. with s. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. these data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. the results further demonstrate that with p. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in  the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.

TI  == polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  == current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. the validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the west haven veterans  administration hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how  many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). during 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and  the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. in these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4  months before the episode of bacteremia. only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). the mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time  of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. prospectively, nine other patients  with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). this study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.

TI  == tobramycin: a review of its antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == synopsis: tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum in vitro, and pharmacokinetic properties similar to those  for gentamicin. tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and active against many gentamicin resistant strains, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae resistant to gentamicin. theoretically, tobramycin has an advantage over gentamicin against infections caused by p. aeruginosa, but any advantage in clinical practice has yet to be adequately demonstrated. clinical experience with tobramycin is considerably less than with  gentamicin. whilst tobramycin appears to offer no clear advantages over gentamicin against sensitive organisms it is indicated in infection caused by strains of p. aeruginosa which are resistant to gentamicin, but sensitive to tobramycin. like gentamicin, tobramycin acts synergistically with corbenicillin and the cephalosporins. the efficacy of the tobramycin-carbenicillin combination  has been shown in endocarditis caused by p. aeruginosa which was unresponsive to  gentamicin plus carbenicillin. ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity similar to that seen with other animoglycosides have been encountered in therapeutic trials with  tobramycin and wider clinical experience is necessary to determine the relative incidence of these side-effects with gentamicin and tobramycin used under similar conditions. antimicrobial activity: in comparative studies, in vitro, tobramycin  is more active than gentamicin against clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. similarly, the inhibitory index, which is the ratio between the serum concentration attained at usual therapuetic doses and the minimum inhibitory concentration, for pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher for tobramycin than for gentamicin. against gram-negative bacteria other than pseudomonas spp. the spectrum of activity of tobramycin is similar to that of gentamicin. for most species the activity of tobramycin is slightly less than that of gentamicin. gentamicin is consistently more active than tobramycin against serratia marcescens. like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, tobramycin is active in vitro  in low concentrations against staphylococcus aureus. tobramycin is essentially inactive against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). maner aminoglycosides and of other antibiotics against  various bacteria in vitro, but comparisons between studies cannot always be interpreted literally because the activity of many antibiotics in vitro, including tobramycin, is influenced by the nature of the culture media and the presence of certain salts. the sensitivity of p. aeruginosa to tobramycin is influenced by the magnesium, and calcium content of the culture media whilst that of all species is reduced by sodium ions. wide variations in the concentration of these ions may result in divergent mic values and an inappropriate choice of antibacterial agent to treat pseudomonas infection...

AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

AB  == therapeutic effect of lividomycin was observed in patients with infections of the respiratory tract (infections in association with bronchiectasis, mixed infections of cavities after negative conversion of tubercle bacilli, pneumonia,  and so forth). significant improvement of clinical symptoms was observed in 15 cases and no improvement in 4 cases. lividomycin was administered at a dose of 1  g/day for 3 to 15 days. staphylococcus aureus (9 cases), klebsiella pneumoniae (1 case), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (3 cases), aerococcus (4 cases) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case) were suggested to be causative organisms in the above-mentioned patients. (in one case, however, causative organism was not determined.) lividomycin seemed to be effective in cases of infections with staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas not effective in a case of infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa. in order to differentiate causative organisms from the organisms constantly existing on the upper respiratory tract, alkali treatment was employed as an aid for the determination of the causative organisms. however, further studies are desirable  for the evaluation of this procedure.

TI  == [clinical effects of lividomycin on respiratory tract infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis (author's transl)].
AB  == patients with various respiratory infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis, were treated with lividomycin (lvdm) at a dose of 1 g/day for about a week. the results obtained are as follows: 1. of the 15 patients with refractory bronchiectasis who had previously been treated with various other antibiotics, 11 patients (73.3%) responded to lvdm. although there was no patient who responded to lvdm excellently, good cures were achieved in 5 pateints and fair cures in 6 patients. 2. in bronchiectasis patients having infections in association with pulmonary tuberculosis (mixed infections), lvdm did not show any remarkable effects, excepting that fair cures were achieved in 3 patients. 3. in  the 7 patients with acute bronchopneumonia, excellent, good and fair cures were achieved in 1, 5 and 1 patient, respectively. although lvdm was effective in all  of the patients with the said infection, the number of the patients responded excellently was meager and the onset of action seemed to be somewhat slow. 4. in  one patient with lobar pneumonia, lvdm was not effective. 5. the mic values of lvdm for clinically isolated various organisms are summarized below: pseudomonas  aeruginosa 50 mcg/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 3.13 to 6.25 mcg/ml, haemophilis influenzae 1.56 to 6.25 mcg/ml, diplococcus pneumoniae 50 mcg/ml, alpha-streptococcus 50 to 100 mcg/ml, beta-streptococcus 100 mcg/ml, and staphylococcus aureus 1.56 mcg/ml. 6. in spite of the fact that a majority of the patients participated in this study were the aged, lvdm's side effects were limited to an increase of bun (one patient) and eruption (one patient). any noticeable changes in hepatic and renal function, hearing acuity, etc. were not observed. as indicated above, lvdm was effective against, respiratory infections  as well as infections of the urinary tract on which a considerable number of research has already been reported. thus, it is considered to be worthwhile to use lvdm for the treatment of respiratory infections.

TI  == problems and progress towards vaccination against bacterial infections of the respiratory tract.
AB  == a large number of bacterial species are causative agents of respiratory tract disease. the discussion will center on three infections selected because they represent different problems in control on the basis of epidemiologic and immunochemical factors. group a hemolytic streptococci are common upper respiratory tract pathogens which may initiate severe non-suppurative sequelae such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. recent progress concerning m protein vaccines will be reviewed. pneumococci are still the most frequent cause  of pneumonia at all ages. pneumococcal vaccines are the prototype for purified polysaccharide vaccines since their effectiveness was demonstrated 30 years ago.  the major problem in vaccination is the very large number of capsular serotypes.  pseudomonas aeruginosa represents the relatively new problem of gram-negative bacterial infections in the immunodepressed host. demonstration of seven immunotypes as the cause of 90% of human infections has led to preparation of a multivalent vaccine composed of lipopolysaccharide antigens. current knowledge of this vaccine will be discussed.

AB  == in normal human serum chelated with magnesium (10 mm) and ethylene glycotetraacetic acid (10 mm) (mgegta), the classical pathway of complement activation is blocked; however, the alternate pathway of complement activation is intact. diplococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus albus, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus faecalis, and serratia marcescens were opsonized in normal human serum containing 10 mm mgegta. in contrast, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were poorly opsonized in human serum chelated with 10 mm mgedta. therefore certain bacterial species appear to require the classical pathway of complement activation to be opsonized and other bacterial species utilize the alternate pathway of complement activation.

AB  == igg with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to  igg antibacterial antibody preparations. opsonic human igg obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. in vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of i(-)  and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, s. aureus, p. mirabilis, and e. coli. however, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of p. aeruginosa. bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated igg preparations. antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. these in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.

AB  == a study of the relationship of clinical states associated with prolonged infection (bacterial endocarditis and osteomyelitis) and generation of serum anti-gamma globulins was made with particular reference to quantitative amounts of staphylococcal protein a in various infecting strains. no correlation between  individual strain amounts of protein a and presence of anti-gamma globulins was detected. thirty-eight rabbits were immunized intravenously with various strains  of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, streptomyces viridans, pneumococci, pseudomonas, and escherichia coli) for periods of 6 weeks, and antibacterial as well as anti-gamma globulin antibodies were assayed. no single group or strain of bacteria stood out as being more prone to produce anti-gamma globulins than others tested. most rabbits developed anti-gamma globulins reacting with human gamma globulins, whereas the specificity for rabbit gamma globulin appeared more restricted. in 16 rabbits immunized with eight different strains of s. aureus, quantitative elevation of serum gamma globulin above 2.5 g  per 100 ml often seemed to be correlated with presence of detectable serum anti-gamma globulins. by contrast 15 rabbits immunized with autologous or isologous rabbit gamma globulins in many instances developed extremely high titers of anti-gamma globulins showing primary specificity for human rather than  rabbit gamma globulin. these studies further amplify the remarkably heterogeneous anti-gamma globulin reactivity associated with various types of immune response.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  == epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. these included single strains of streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, salmonella schottmuelleri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. in oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. the concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against staphylococcus aureus. it was about 50 times more  active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. coumermycin also showed good activity against group a streptococci and pneumococci, moderate  activity against escherichia coli, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against klebsiella-enterobacter and enterococci. against p. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. the new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.

TI  == quantitation of microorganisms in sputum.
AB  == a method of quantitating microbial cultures of homogenized sputum has been devised. possible application of this method to the problem of determining the etiologic agent of lower-respiratory-tract infections has been studied to determine its usefulness as a guide in the management of these infections. specimens were liquefied by using an equal volume of 2% n-acetyl-l-cysteine. the  liquefied sputum suspension was serially diluted to 10(-1), 10(-3), 10(-5), and 10(-7). these dilutions were plated on appropriate media by using an 0.01-ml calibrated loop; they were incubated and examined by standard diagnostic methods. quantitation of fresh sputum from patients with pneumonia prior to antimicrobial  therapy revealed that probable pathogens were present in populations of 10(7) organisms/ml or greater. normal oropharyngeal flora did not occur in these numbers before therapy. comparison of microbial counts on fresh and aged sputum showed that it is necessary to use only fresh specimens, since multiplication or  death alters both quantitative and qualitative findings. proper collection and quantitative culturing of homogenized sputum provided information more directly applicable to patient management than did qualitative routine methods. not only was the recognition of the probable pathogenic organism in pneumonia patients improved, but serial quantitative cultures were particularly useful in recognizing the emergence of superinfections and in evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  == cephalexin and cephaloglycin activity in vitro and absorption and urinary excretion of single oral doses in normal young adults.
AB  == a large number of recently isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for susceptibility to cephalexin and cephaloglycin by the replica inoculating method. strains of group a hemolytic streptococci, viridans (alpha and gamma) streptococci, pneumococci, gonococci, meningococci, and penicillin g-sensitive staphylococcus aureus were all moderately to highly susceptible to both of these  cephalosporin analogues, nearly all of the strains being two to eight (median four) times more susceptible to cephaloglycin than to cephalexin. the penicillin  g-resistant, penicillinase-producing strains of s. aureus varied in their susceptibility; many were moderately resistant to both analogues, particularly to cephalexin. strains of enterococci, haemophilus influenzae, and most of the common gram-negative bacilli were moderately to highly resistant. reducing the size of the inoculum had variable effects on inhibition by these drugs, depending on the species or strain. the activity of cephalexin was very little affected by  ph of the medium within the clinical range or by incubation at 37 c in broth for  up to 24 hr. in contrast, cephaloglycin in broth deteriorated rapidly at 37 c, and its activity was markedly reduced in alkaline medium. both cephalexin and cephaloglycin were rapidly absorbed and excreted into the urine after single oral doses of 500 mg. much higher levels were achieved and sustained with the former.  absorption of both analogues was delayed when taken with food, and the levels in  the serum were significantly higher and better sustained when probenecid was also given. very high concentrations of cephalexin were excreted into the urine during the first 4 hr, and the levels were still high in the 4- to 8-hr collection. the  concentrations of cephaloglycin in the urine at these times were much lower. an average of 80 to 93% of the dose of cephalexin and 25 to 30% of the cephaloglycin were accounted for as active drug in the urine collected in 8 hr. both analogues  were well tolerated.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

AB  == the comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including klebsiella pneumoniae ad,  salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, staphylococcus aureus (smith), streptococcus pyogenes c203, salmonella pullorum #2, proteus vulgaris 1810, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the  mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. in contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. in a more chronic bacterial infection due to corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial  infection. insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.

AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
