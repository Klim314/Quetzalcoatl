TI  == degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == the effect of antibacterial monomer mdpb on the growth of organisms associated with root caries.
AB  == mdpb, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-mics. mics and mbcs of mdpb for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces gerensceriae, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-mic on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. all isolates were sensitive to inhibition by mdpb. the median mics and mbcs of mdpb for these organisms were  in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively.  as for the influence of ph, inhibition was sensitive to acidic ph. even at sub-mics, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. based on the results of this study, mdpb exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries  lesions.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
