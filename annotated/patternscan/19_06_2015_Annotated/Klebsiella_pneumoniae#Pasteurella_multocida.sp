TI  == integron-bearing gram-negative bacteria in lake waters.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine the occurrence of integron-bearing gram-negative bacteria in the water of four lakes located in wielkopolski national park, poland. altogether, 17 isolates harbouring class 1 or class 2 integrons were found. the integron-bearing bacteria were identified as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pasteurella multocida and aeromonas hydrophila. the variable regions of the class 1 integrons contained aada1 and dfra1-aada1 gene cassettes, whereas class 2 integrons carried dfra1-sat2-aada1 gene cassette array. the isolates were resistant to 3-20 antimicrobials. one of them produced shv-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. significance and impact  of the study: integrons play a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance  among bacteria. they are frequently found in clinical bacterial strains, but are  also detected in environmental isolates in sites affected by anthropogenic pressure. little is known, however, about the presence and characteristics of integrons in bacteria living in water environments in areas of nature preservation. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focused on detection and characterization of integrons in bacteria living in water ecosystems in a national park.

TI  == the ompa family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  == the ompa family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in  the outer membrane of mainly gram-negative bacteria. ompa proteins are characterized by an n-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. the c-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. escherichia coli ompa is the best  characterized of the proteins. other well-characterized ompa-equivalent proteins  from pathogenic bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf, haemophilus influenzae p5, klebsiella pneumoniae ompa, and chlamydia trachomatis major outer  membrane protein (momp). ompa from the veterinary pathogens mannheimia haemolytica, haemophilus parasuis, leptospira interrogans, and pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. among many of the pathogenic bacteria, ompa proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. these pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. alternatively, ompa family proteins can serve as targets of  the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. in several cases, ompa proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of poland.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of poland in years 2003-2005. bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from california mastitis test (cmt) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of api tests (analytical profile index). it was found that 32.7% of samples that were cmt positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (14.6%), staph. aureus (8.6%), gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among gram-negative bacilli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), serratia marcescens (3.1%), pasteurella multocida (3.1%), acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria  species. stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), staph. hyicus (12.2%), staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), staph. sciuri (11.6%), staph. chromogenes (8.8%), staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent cns. streptococcus uberis (50%), str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), str. acidominimus (6.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among camp-negative streptococci. an increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, staph. aureus, a. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.

TI  == oral bacterial flora of dogs with and without rabies: a preliminary study in thailand.
AB  == the authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid  dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. a total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. the most frequently isolated organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pasteurella species. there were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. from  the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. one or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. the predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds  were, as follows: staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, moraxella species, pasteurella canis, and enterobacter cloacae. however, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. the results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.

TI  == bacteremia associated with naturally occuring acute coliform mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (acm) with a wide range of disease severity. design: cohort study. animals: 144 dairy cows with acm from 6 herds. procedure: cows were examined at time of identification of acm (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), cbc, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. appropriate samples were  obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an acm episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. results: bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). group-1  isolates (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with acm and 0 of 156 control cows. group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe acm, respectively. escherichia coli and k pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of  the same genotype. bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. conclusions and  clinical relevance: results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with acm. classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with acm.

TI  == bacterial ghosts as multifunctional vaccine particles.
AB  == expression of cloned phix174 gene e in gram-negative bacteria results in lysis of the bacteria by formation of an e-specific transmembrane tunnel structure built through the cell envelope complex. bacterial ghosts have been produced from a variety of bacteria including escherichia coli. salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio cholerae, klebsiella pneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, and helicobacter pylori. such ghosts are used as non-living candidate  vaccines and represent an alternative to heat or chemically inactivated bacteria. in recombinant ghosts, foreign proteins can be inserted into the inner membrane prior to e-mediated lysis via specific n-, or c-, or n- and c-terminal anchor sequences. the export of proteins into the periplasmic space or the expression of recombinant s-layer proteins vastly extents the capacity of ghosts or recombinant ghosts as carriers of foreign epitopes or proteins. oral, aerogenic or parenteral applications of (recombinant) ghosts in experimental animals induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses against bacterial and target components including protective mucosal immunity. the most relevant advantage of ghosts and  recombinant bacterial ghosts as immunogens is that no inactivation procedures that denature relevant immunogenic determinants are employed in the production of ghosts used as vaccines or as carriers of relevant antigens. the inserted target  antigens into the inner membrane or into s-layer proteins are not limited in size.

TI  == [epizootics of pasteurellosis in a semi-intensive breeding farm of indigenous rabbits in senegal].
AB  == epizootic pasteurellosis appeared in a semi-intensive breeding farm (200 animals) of indigenous rabbits in thies (ensa), senegal, during the 1995 wet season (august to october). it provoked death in 87 animals. young animals were particularly sensitive to the disease. nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, eye loss  and otitis media and interna were observed in young rabbits while posterior paresis was noted in mature rabbits. pasteurella multocida, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aerogenes were identified. an antibiogram revealed the germs were sensitive to chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and colistin. high temperatures and humidity during the wet season may have contributed to the outbreak of the disease from healthy carriers introduced at the founding of the farm. colistin and chloramphenicol treatments were administered before vaccinating all rabbits against pasteurellosis.

TI  == identification of pasteurella multocida tryptophan synthase beta-subunit by antisera against strain p1059.
AB  == pasteurella multocida strain p1059 is a highly virulent bacterium which causes fowl cholera in turkeys and chickens. a genomic library of p. multocida p1059 dna was constructed using puc19, expressed in escherichia coli dh5 alpha, and screened with chicken antisera generated against p. multocida p1059. twelve out of the 4100 clones screened were immunoreactive. plasmids isolated from these twelve clones were transformed into e. coli csr603 for maxicell analysis. five proteins, with molecular masses of 34, 37, 43, 46 and 55 kda, were expressed. further work focused on the 43 kda protein because it was expressed at levels detectable by sds-page and immunoblot analysis. the nucleotide sequence of the 1.8 kbp insert containing the gene encoding this protein was determined. the sequence contained three open reading frames (orfs). the first orf (orf1) did not appear to code for any known protein. the second orf (orf2) encoded a protein of  403 amino acids (43,662 da). the deduced amino acid sequence showed 77% identity  (84% similarity) with the tryptophan synthase beta subunit (trpb) of salmonella typhimurium and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the eight conserved regions of trpb are  observed in the p. multocida enzyme, including the conserved lysine (lys-88) and  consensus sequence (gggsna) implicated in pyridoxal phosphate binding. the expression and identity of the p. multocida trpb were confirmed by complementation studies using e. coli w3110 tnaa2 trpb9578. the third orf (orf3)  consisted of the first 77 nucleotides of the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase (trpa), and overlapped the 3'-end of trpb by 14 nucleotides.  the deduced amino acid sequence of the 77 nucleotides of the p. multocida trpa had 68% identity (92% similarity) with the analogous region of trpa from klebsiella aerogenes (k. pneumoniae).

TI  == pasteurella multocida produces a protein with homology to the p6 outer membrane protein of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == an antibody specific for a 16-kda outer membrane protein of a rabbit strain of pasteurella multocida was used to probe representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes of p. multocida, as well as the vaccine strains cu and m9, and all were shown to express the protein. the gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced and found to have extensive sequence homology with the gene encoding the p6 protein of haemophilus influenzae. the protein in p. multocida has been designated p6-like. the gene encoding the p6-like protein was used to probe members of the family pasteurellaceae and other gram-negative bacteria. representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes (as well as the vaccine strains cu and m9) of p. multocida hybridized with the p6-like gene under conditions of high stringency. the dna from h. influenzae hybridized weakly with the p6-like gene under these conditions, but pasteurella haemolytica (representatives of a and t biotypes), bordetella bronchiseptica, b. avium, actinobacillus suis, a. suis-like, a. lignieresii, a. ureae, a. rossii, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. equuli, and various members of the family enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium) did not hybridize detectably.  under conditions of lower stringency, the p6-like gene also hybridized strongly with dna from p. multocida, h. influenzae, and a. rossii but weakly with dna from p. haemolytica and members of the genus actinobacillus. these results suggest that the p6-like protein of p. multocida might be useful as an immunizing product to protect poultry from avian cholera. this suggestion stems from (i) our finding that the p6-like protein in p. multocida is widely distributed among all the somatic serotypes and (ii) the previous work of others demonstrating that the p6  protein of h. influenzae elicits a protective immune response in animal models of human disease.

TI  == ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae by normal serum.
AB  == pulmonary surfactant has been shown to play an increasingly important role in bacterial clearance at the alveolar surface in the lung. this study describes a bactericidal mechanism in which ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica by normal serum. to demonstrate killing, six bacterial species were incubated first with pulmonary surfactant for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then with serum for an additional 60 min at 37 degrees c. p. haemolytica type a1 strains 82-25 and l101, a p. haemolytica type 2 strain, escherichia coli, and  klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible and pasteurella multocida, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible to killing by ovine pulmonary surfactant and normal serum. no bacteria incubated with bovine pulmonary surfactant were killed by normal serum. although the species origin of  pulmonary surfactant was selective, the species origin of serum was not. p. haemolytica incubated with ovine pulmonary surfactant was killed by fetal calf serum, gnotobiotic calf serum, pooled normal sheep serum, pooled normal rabbit serum, and pooled guinea pig serum. ultrastructurally, killed p. haemolytica suspensions contained dead cells and cells distorted with vacuoles between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. the mechanism of killing did not correlate with concentrations of complement or lysozyme or titers of residual antibody in either the pulmonary surfactant or the serum, and killing was reduced by preincubation of surfactant with p. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide. preliminary characterization of both surfactant and serum implicate a low-molecular-weight proteinaceous component in the surfactant and serum albumin  in the serum. this mechanism may help clear certain gram-negative bacteria from the lungs of sheep as a part of the pulmonary innate defense system.

AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == hazards of disease transfer from marine mammals to land mammals: review and recent findings.
AB  == in a 5-year study (1972-1977) of microbial agents isolated from both clinically normal and diseased marine mammals, it was shown that certain disease agents are  widespread in a diversity of ocean populations and that some are also transmissible to a number of terrestrial mammal species. leptospira interrogans serovar pomona has been isolated repeatedly from 2 species of pinnipeds (zalophus californianus califonianus and callorhinus ursinus). some of the more important bacterial pathogens for land mammals that were isolated from wild marine mammals  are pseudomonas mallei, clostridium chauvoei, c novyi, neisseria mucosa var heidelbergensis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp, and pasteurella multocida. numerous serotypes of viruses classified as caliciviruses were isolated from a variety of marine mammals. some of these are known to infect several land mammal species including swine horses, and primates. for this reason., precautions should be taken to ensure that disease agents shed by captive marine mammals are not transmitted to susceptible terrestrial mammals, including animal handlers and other human beings.

TI  == [possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  == in the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. as shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (klebsiella ozanae, k. pneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus pneumoniae), mycoplasma pneumoniae and m. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (bacillus cereus, brucella abortus, erysipelothrix insidiosa, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, s. typhi). consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the c-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. in modified boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much  less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated  ones (fig. 1).

TI  == respiratory pathogens in monkeys.
AB  == respiratory disease in a dynamic colony of nonhuman primates during a 4-year period was due primarily to infections caused by klebsiella pneumoniae, diplococcus pneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, and haemophilus influenzae. the principal secondary invaders were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci. a high fatality rate was associated with infections caused by each of the primary pathogens, and females appeared to be more susceptible than males. incidence of respiratory disease was greatest in the fall and early winter; however, at all times newly colonized monkeys had a higher infection rate than conditioned monkeys. infections were occasionally confined only to the lungs and were sometimes present without grossly observable lung lesions. the information given on susceptibility of 10 species of nonhuman primates to respiratory infections provides a basis for developing disease models.
