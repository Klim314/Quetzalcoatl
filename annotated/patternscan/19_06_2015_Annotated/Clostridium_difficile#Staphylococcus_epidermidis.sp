TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  == in a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10%  fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. in the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, streptococcus group b, clostridium difficile, bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter). conclusion: the data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.

TI  == inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success  and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin a, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against  719 recent clinical gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type  cultures. hmr 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with mic90s of < or =0.5 mg/l, except for staphylococcus epidermidis (mic90 > 128 mg/l), haemophilus influenzae (mic90 = 2 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (mic90 = 2 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic90 = 1 mg/l) and the anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 2 mg/l) and clostridium difficile (mic90 = 1 mg/l). in general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the mics of hmr 3647. additionally, the in-vitro activity of hmr 3647 was not affected by the presence  of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. the antichlamydial activity of hmr 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.

TI  == [genotyping of isolates of bacteria and candida].
AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == teicoplanin or vancomycin in the treatment of gram-positive infections?
AB  == the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin have similar mechanisms of action on bacterial cell wall synthesis. their spectra of activity are limited to gram-positive bacteria, with the degree of bactericidal activity depending on  the species of micro-organism. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, enterococci and clostridium difficile are generally sensitive, including methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. glycopeptide resistance has recently emerged in staphylococci and enterococci. vancomycin has  a shorter half-life than teicoplanin and requires multiple dosing to maintain adequate serum levels. it can only be given by prolonged intravenous infusion over 1 h. in contrast, the pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin allow for once-daily dosing, either by rapid intravenous infusion or by the intramuscular route. the latter offers reliable absorption for patients with limited venous access and is  also of benefit for out-patient therapy. teicoplanin is a safer drug than vancomycin. it is associated with a lower incidence of nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. compared to vancomycin, the availability of the intramuscular route  and the absence of a requirement for routine serum monitoring, together with the  reduced need to treat drug-related side-effects make teicoplanin more cost-effective. it is as effective as vancomycin for most indications, is safe, easy to administer and an important agent for treating gram-positive infections.  its role in hospitals is likely to increase if the price of drug acquisition is kept low.

TI  == everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (sch) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated  against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. everninomicin showed  the highest activity against the species tested and mics90% of everninomicin against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  enterococcus faecium and clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. mics90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) were 0.78 microgram/ml. laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in  strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very  slow rate. post-antibiotic effect against strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. adherence to glass surface of an mrsa strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub mic of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.

TI  == emerging problems in gram-positive infections in the postoperative patient.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are increasingly prevalent in the postoperative patient population and are important as pathogens. as increasingly ill and elderly patients undergo surgical treatment and as increased use is made of invasive or immunosuppressive treatment modalities, this trend is likely to accelerate. the increasing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics results in the emergence of resistant pathogens or superinfections that are increasingly difficult to treat.  examples of such pathogens include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and clostridium difficile. no acute care setting, from large urban teaching hospital to small rural community hospital, is immune to the trend. the clinical challenge posed by these organisms is compounded by the fact that serious gram-positive infections can be impossible to distinguish on clinical grounds from their gram-negative counterparts. the host inflammatory response to gram-positive infection is quite similar to that caused by gram-negative infection, including elaboration of cytokine mediators and progression to visceral organ dysfunction. the clinician must be cognizant that serious infections, especially of nosocomial origin, may be caused by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [secondary penetration of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt into the intestines. possible cause of a recurring sepsis?].
AB  == we present a 28-year-old-patient with a severe head injury: skull fractures, epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, glasgow coma score 7, and aspiration  following a motorbike accident. a systemic infection with symptoms of shock and staphylococcus aureus in blood culture specimens developed a few days after admission (later staphylococcus epidermidis was also cultured). a posttraumatic hydrocephalus was treated by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt inserted at mini-laparotomy. in multiple microbiological and cytological tests the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was always sterile. enterocolitis occurred with clostridium difficile and staphylococcus aureus in stool cultures. after 6 months' intractable sepsis the patient died with multiple-system failure. autopsy revealed secondary displacement of the shunt catheter into the intestinal lumen.  a possible ascending infection was found in the form of a cerebral ventricular empyema. however, prior to death there was no specific clinical sign of peritonitis or encephalitis or a positive microbiological or cytological csf findings. despite insertion of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt under visual control, this case shows that secondary displacement of the peritoneal extremity  into the bowel can occur, which may cause a cerebral and eventually a systemic infection. csf examinations may fail to show contamination; specific clinical signs may be absent or, with multiple-system failure, misleading. an autopsy is generally to be recommended as it contributes to a better understanding of the clinical problems in most cases.

TI  == in-vitro activity of vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, mdl 62873 and other agents against staphylococci, enterococci and clostridium difficile.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of different antibiotics were determined by a broth microdilution method for staphylococci, enterococci and clostridium difficile. the antimicrobial agents tested were vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, mdl 62873, rifampicin and piperacillin, the  latter limited to enterococci. in terms of mic90s, daptomycin (0.89 mg/l). mdl 62873 (0.99 mg/l), and teicoplanin (1.50 mg/l) were found to be highly active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). daptomycin (mic90 0.48 mg/l), mdl 62873 (0.95 mg/l) and ramoplanin (1.45 mg/l) were the most active drugs against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse). teicoplanin (mic90 0.45 mg/l) was the most active agent against enterococci, followed by mdl 62873 (0.65 mg/l) and daptomycin (1.60 mg/l). mdl 62873 gave the lowest mic90 (0.17 mg/l) for c. difficile. teicoplanin (mic90 0.42 mg/l), daptomycin (0.87 mg/l) and ramoplanin (0.98 mg/l) were also very active. our results indicate that teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin and mdl 62873, a teicoplanin derivative, are  potentially effective alternative antibiotics for treatment of infections caused  by staphylococci, enterococci and c. difficile.

TI  == molecular cloning and genetic analysis of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase determinant from clostridium difficile.
AB  == a gene bank from a clinical isolate of clostridium difficile expressing high chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was constructed by cloning sau3a-cleaved clostridial dna fragments into the plasmid vector puc13. among 1,020 clones tested, 11 were resistant to chloramphenicol; 1 of these, with an insert size of 1.9 kilobases (pppm9), was studied further. the clone pppm9 was mapped using a variety of restriction enzymes, and a 0.27-kilobase ecorv-taqi restriction fragment was shown to be within the chloramphenicol resistance (cmr)  gene by using transposon (tn1000) mutagenesis. the 0.27-kilobase fragment and the 1.9-kilobase insert were radiolabeled and used as dna probes in hybridization studies. southern blot analysis with the gene probes against chromosomal dna from cmr strains of c. difficile obtained from five distinct geographical locations revealed that at least two copies of the same chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were present for each strain. hybridization of the gene probes against cmr strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella edwardsii, escherichia coli, and to four other clostridial species revealed no homology even under conditions of low stringency.

AB  == this article describes the infectious complications that occurred among four of the longest-term recipients of the jarvik-7 artificial heart. infection arising from the drive lines, with spread to the mediastinal periprosthetic space, was the major limiting factor in long-term use of the device in these patients. periprosthetic infections were due to coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species. other infectious complications incurred by some of the patients included pneumonia, empyema, urinary tract infection, and intravascular line sepsis with candida. intensive antimicrobial therapy for prolonged periods seemed to suppress but not to eradicate infection and was accompanied by the appearance of multiresistant bacterial strains. complications of antimicrobial therapy included diarrhea secondary to overgrowth with clostridium difficile in two patients. use  of the current device for more than 30 days should be considered extraordinary and should be reserved for patients for whom no other form of life support is available.

AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  == superinfections during antimicrobial treatment with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  == the frequency, etiology and risk factors of superinfections during and/or within  one week after antibiotic therapy with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations were evaluated in 631 patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the institute of hematology of rome from january 1982 to december 1984. 356 patients  (56%) developed 402 episodes of proven or presumed infection. of these patients,  78 developed 102 superinfections. overall, superinfections responded less satisfactorily to antibiotic therapy than the primary febrile episodes (63% vs. 85%). the distribution of etiologic agents of superinfections differed from those responsible for primary infections, since fungi and anaerobes (especially clostridium difficile) were mostly isolated after antibiotic therapy had begun. moreover, among aerobic bacteria, frequently antibiotic-resistant species, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis  were the leading etiologic agents of superinfection. the risk of superinfection appeared to increase with the depth and persistence of granulocytopenia. on the other hand, the length of hospitalization, length of previous antibiotic therapy, previous chemoprophylaxis and presence of indwelling venous catheter did not affect the risk of superinfection.

TI  == [bacterial agents of hospital infections].
AB  == during the last decades the spectrum of microorganisms causing nosocomial infections has changed. the frequency of streptococci group a decreased and bacteria formerly considered as apathogen now cause serious infections. more and  more "new" organisms are responsible for nosocomial infections. especially in immunocompromised patients legionella pneumophila causes infections with often severe and fatal course. clostridium difficile can be isolated in 6% to 48% in the stool of patients with antibacterial treatment. up to 36% of all hospitalized patients excrete clostridium difficile asymptomatically. acinetobacter species are responsible for 1% to 3% of all nosocomial infections. these changes are probably due to selection by antibiotics and an increase of invasive medical procedures even in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == clindamycin as an anti-staphylococcal agent--indications and limitations.
AB  == in a general survey it is stated that for single staphylococcus aureus infections, clindamycin is not considered to be a first-line drug. its chief indication is penicillin allergy. penetration and accumulation of clindamycin within leukocytes demonstrated in vitro may be of value in the treatment of s. aureus diseases resulting in large abscesses. an insidious risk of the development of clostridium difficile diarrhoea limits the use of clindamycin in ambulatory long-term treatment of diabetic osteitis and chronic osteomyelitis. such patients must therefore be carefully checked during clindamycin therapy. in  staphylococcal endocarditis treated with clindamycin, relapses and development of resistance have been reported. mixed staphylococcal and anaerobic infections in skin, subcutaneous tissue, the diabetic foot, bone and joints are primary indications for clindamycin. s. epidermidis infections, especially septicemia and endocarditis, are not suitable for clindamycin therapy due to a high rate of resistance.

TI  == clinical usefulness of vancomycin.
AB  == the antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, and clinical uses of vancomycin are reviewed. vancomycin interferes with peptidoglycan biosynthesis in multiplying organisms and is bactericidal. it is supplied as the hydrochloride salt and is available in 500-mg ampuls. vancomycin is usually administered intravenously or orally. i.v. vancomycin should be administered slowly (over 30--60 min) and in an adequate volume (100--250 ml) of 5% dextrose injection. usual adult dose is 500 mg every six hours or 1 g every 12 hours. serum vancomycin kinetics are best explained on the basis of a two- or three-compartment open model. vancomycin is almost completely eliminated through the kidneys. mean vancomycin concentrations  in the presence of inflamed meninges, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, ascitic fluid, synovial fluid, and bile are approximately 15% of the serum concentrations. vancomycin is used prophylactically to prevent infections caused  by gram-positive cocci. vancomycin is an ideal drug for prophylaxis in prosthetic implant surgery because of its long serum half-life and activity against staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus. vancomycin has been used in the prevention and treatment of shunt infection in hemodialysis patients. it can be used adjunctly with a number of antibiotics to treat a variety of bacterial infections. vancomycin is recognized as one of the most potent antistaphylococcal drugs available. it is the drug-of-choice in the treatment of serious methicillin-resistant staph. aureus infections. it is the preferred therapy for clostridium difficile (antibiotic-associated) colitis.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str.  faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse  septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
