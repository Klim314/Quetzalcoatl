TI  == reduction in phytic acid content and enhancement of antioxidant properties of nutricereals by processing for developing a fermented baby food.
AB  == cereal blends containing pearl millet (pennisetum glaucum), sorghum (sorghum bicolor) and oat (avena sativa) in different ratios were processed (roasted and germinated) and also used as unprocessed flours followed by fermentation with lactobacillus sp. (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum). they were screened for total phenolic content (tpc), phytic acid content (pac) and free radical scavenging activity (frsa). a formulation with the highest tpc, frsa and  the lowest pac was selected to optimize a nutricereal based fermented baby food containing selected fermented cereal blends (fcb), rice-corn cooked flour (rcf),  whole milk powder (wmp), whey protein concentrate (wpc) and sugar. the optimized  baby food formulation contained 37.41 g 100 g(-1) fcb, 9.75 g 100 g(-1) rcf, 27.84 g 100 g(-1) wmp, 5 g 100 g(-1) wpc and 20 g 100 g(-1) sugar. it had high protein, vitamin, minerals, as well as good quantity of carbohydrates and fat, to fulfil the nutritional needs of preschool children of age 1-3 years. the nutricereal based fermented baby food showed high water absorption capacity, dispersibility, wettability and flowability indicating good reconstitution properties.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities of kombucha.
AB  == kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and  yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. it is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health  benefits. it has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in  that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. there are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. in this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity  was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, escherichia coli atcc 8739, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028 and bacillus cereus atcc 11778. our  findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha. this study illustrates the potential of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the bioactivities of kombucha.

TI  == short communication: single molecule, real-time sequencing technology revealed species- and strain-specific methylation patterns of 2 lactobacillus strains.
AB  == pacific biosciences' (menlo park, ca) single molecule, real-time sequencing technology was reported to have some advantages in generating finished genomes and characterizing the epigenome of bacteria. in the present study, this technology was used to sequence 2 lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus casei zhang and lactobacillus plantarum p-8. previously, the former bacterium was sequenced by an applied biosystems 3730 dna analyzer (grand island, ny), whereas  the latter one was analyzed with roche 454 (indianapolis, in) and illumina sequencing technologies (san diego, ca). the results showed that single molecule, real-time sequencing resulted in high-quality, finished genomes for both strains. interestingly, epigenome analysis indicates the presence of 1 active n(6)-methyladenine methyltransferase in l. casei zhang, but none in l. plantarum  p-8. our study revealed for the first time a completely different methylation pattern in 2 lactobacillus strains.

TI  == [comparison of expression and antibacterial activities of recombinant porcine lactoferrin expressed in four lactobacillus species].
AB  == the coding sequence for the mature peptide of porcine lactoferrin (plf) was synthesized according to the codon usage of lactobacillus, to establish optimized porcine lactoferrin lactobacillus expression system. the gene was ligated into the xho i/bamh i site of lactobacillus expression vector ppg612.1 and the recombinant plasmid ppg612.1-plf was transformed individually into lactobacillus  casei atcc393, lactobacillus pentosus klds1.0413, lactobacillus plantarum klds1.0344 or lactobacillus paracasei klds1.0652 by electroporation. after induction with xylose, expression of the recombinant proteins was detected by western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. secretion of recombinant plf proteins from four recombinant species was determined quantitatively by elisa. the antibacterial activities of recombinant proteins were measured by agar diffusion method. the result shows that plf was correctly expressed in four species of recombinant lactobacillus, with molecular weight of about 73 kda. the  expression levels in recombinant lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei were 9.6 mug/ml, 10.8 mug/ml, 12.5 mug/ml and 9.9 mug/ml, respectively. antimicrobial activity experiment shows that the recombinant proteins were active against e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, listeria, pasteurella. the recombinant plf expressed by recombinant lactobacillus plantarum showed the best antibacterial activity among  all recombinant lactobacillus species. these data represent a basis for the development and application of porcine lactoferrin from recombinant lactobacillus.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity of tropical grass-legumes silages.
AB  == calliandra calothyrsus preserved in silage is an alternative method for improving the crude protein content of feeds for sustainable ruminant production. the aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of silage which contained different  levels of c. calothyrsus by examining the fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. silage was made in a completely randomized design consisting of five treatments with three replications i.e.: r0, pennisetum purpureum 100%; r1, p. purpureum 75%+c. calothyrsus 25%;, r2, p. purpureum 50%+c. calothyrsus 50%; r3, p. purpureum 25%+c. calothyrsus 75%; and r4, c. calothyrsus 100%. all silages were prepared using plastic jar silos (600 g) and incubated at room temperature for 30 days. silages were analyzed for fermentation characteristics and microbial diversity. increased levels of c. calothyrsus in silage had a significant effect (p<0.01) on the fermentation characteristics. the microbial diversity index decreased and activity was inhibited with increasing levels of c. calothyrsus. the microbial community indicated that there was a population of lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. brevis, lactococcus lactis, chryseobacterium sp., and uncultured bacteria. the result confirmed that silage with a combination of grass and c. calothyrsus had good fermentation characteristics and microbial communities were dominated by l. plantarum.

TI  == the use of the replication region of plasmid prs7 from oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a chimeric plasmid, prs7rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of prs7, a large plasmid from oenococcus oeni, and pem64, a plasmid derived from pij2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. prs7rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in escherichia coli using its pij2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (lab) using the replication region of prs7. high levels of transformants per microg of dna were obtained by electroporation of prs7rep into pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). a preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that p. acidilactici and l. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas l. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. prs7rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, bamhi, xbai, sali, hincii, sphi and psti, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in l. plantarum, but was less stable in l. casei and p. acidilactici. the ability of prs7rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from o. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.

TI  == microbial communities involved in kasar cheese ripening.
AB  == the microbiota of non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) and their concomitant  community dynamics during cheese ripening were investigated for traditional turkish kasar cheeses made from raw cows' milk. five batches of 15 kasar cheeses  produced in different dairy plants located in kars were analysed during their whole ripening phase up to 180 days. lactobacilli and lactococci were determined  as the prevailing microbial groups. the molecular classification and identification of 594 lab isolates during kasar cheese ripening were performed through (gtg)5-pcr fingerprinting of their genomic dna followed by verification of the (gtg)5-pcr clusters obtained after numerical analysis through 16s rrna gene sequencing of representative isolates. lactobacillus casei (247 isolates, 41.6%), lactobacillus plantarum (77 isolates, 13.0%), and pediococcus acidilactici (58 isolates, 9.8%) were the prevailing nslab species in all kasar cheeses of the different dairy plants investigated throughout cheese ripening. the data of the present study contribute to the inventory of unique cheese varieties to enable the prevention of losses of microbial biodiversity and the selection of starter cultures for controlled cheese manufacturing.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

TI  == novel pyrano and vinylphenol adducts of deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum sourdough.
AB  == this study determined the fate of deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum sourdoughs. sourdoughs prepared from the red sorghum variety town were fermented with the caffeic acid-decarboxylating strains lactobacillus plantarum fua3171 and the decarboxylase negative l. casei fua3166. deoxyanthocyanidins were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms). apigeninidin and methoxyapigeninidin were the major deoxyanthocyanidins prior to fermentation. during fermentation, novel deoxyanthocyanidins were formed. purification by preparative lc, followed by nmr analysis and high-resolution ms identified two of the compounds as 6-deoxyanthocyanidin-vinylphenol and pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin. to identify pathways for their formation, sorghum was fermented with single strains, l. plantarum or l. casei. 6-deoxyanthocyanidin-vinylphenol and pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin were formed only during fermentation with l. plantarum fua3171, indicating a role of vinylphenol in their formation. chemical synthesis confirmed that 6-deoxyanthocyanidin-vinylphenol and pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin are formed from  apigeninidin with vinylphenol but not with p-coumaric acid as reactants. in conclusion, the products of microbial decarboxylation of hydroxycinnamic acids convert apigeninidin and methoxyapigeninidin to pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidins and  vinylphenol adducts.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

TI  == antimutagenic and anticancer effects of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana through ames test and phylogenetic analysis by 16s rdna.
AB  == deaths due to cancer have been increasing in many countries in recent years. one  of the beneficial probiotic properties is potential of antimutagenic and anticancer effects. the aim of this study was to investigate antimutagenic and anticancer effects of 25 strains of lactobacilli spp isolated from tarhana in vitro conditions and to identify selected strains based on molecular biology. antimutagenicity and anticarcinogenicity tests were performed based on proposed method of professor ames et al. identification of selected strains was performed  based on biochemical and molecular tests. study of antimutagenic and anticancer effects of 25 different strains led to identification of 4 isolates of lactobacillus spp. higher antimutagenic activities against sodium azide were observed in cell suspensions of 4 strains as compared with their supernatants. so the inhibitory percentage of cell suspensions among 4 strains was equal to 60.38% in its highest level. antimutagenicity of these strains was also increased in the presence of rat s9. four selected strains were identified based on 16s rdna sequence. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus brevis  isolated from tarhana exhibited high antimutagenic and anticancer activity. of 25 strains of lactobacilli, 4 strains with the highest antimutagenicity effect were  chosen as new potential probiotic strains.

TI  == a new risk factor for neonatal vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonisation: bacterial probiotics.
AB  == abstract objective: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) colonisation can be controlled with strict adherence to infection control measures. we describe a vre outbreak coincident with bacterial probiotic trial. relationship between probiotic and vre colonisation, and other possible risk factors were investigated. methods: two hundred and ten infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks had been randomised for a trial with probiotic preparation containing lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium lactis, fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, colostrums and lactoferrin (nbl probiotic atp(r); nobel, istanbul, turkey) between february  2012 and august 2013 when a vre outbreak also took place. the existence of a relationship between this probiotic preparation and vre colonisation was investigated. results: the begining and end of the outbreak were coincident with  the beginning and end of the probiotic trial. demographic and clinical features of neonates did not differ between vre colonised (n = 94) and non-colonised infants (n = 116) except for vancomycin (p = 0.012) and probiotic (p < 0.001) use. conclusions: probiotic and vancomycin exposure were significant risk factors for vre colonisation. the acquisition and transfer of resistance genes of bacteria may be mediated by probiotics. therefore, the safety of probiotics is a  concern and should be investigated further.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria in the rumen and feces of dairy cows fed total mixed ration silage to assess the survival of silage bacteria in the gut.
AB  == the survival of silage lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the gut of dairy cows was evaluated by examining the lab communities of silage and gut contents. samples were collected at 2 different research institutes (mie and okayama) that offered  total mixed ration (tmr) silage throughout the year. silage and feces were sampled in august, october, and november at the mie institute, whereas silage, rumen fluid, and feces were sampled in june and august at the okayama institute.  denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using lactobacillus-specific primers was  performed to detect lab species in the samples. the selected bands were purified  for species identification and the band patterns were used for principal component analysis. lactic acid was the predominant fermentation product in all the tmr silages analyzed, and the lactic acid level tended to be constant regardless of the sampling time and region. a total of 14 lab species were detected in the tmr silage samples, of which 5 (lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus suebicus, and lactobacillus plantarum) were detected in the dairy cow feces. most of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis bands for the feces samples were also detected in the rumen fluid, suggesting that any elimination of silage lab occurred in the rumen and not in the postruminal gut segments. the principal component analysis indicated that the lab communities in the silage, rumen fluid, and feces were separately grouped; hence, the survival of silage lab in the cow rumen and lower gut was deemed difficult. it was concluded that, although the gut lab community is robust and not easily affected by the silage conditions, several lab species can inhabit both silage and feces, which suggests the potential of using silage as a vehicle for conveying probiotics.

TI  == isolating and evaluating lactic acid bacteria strains for effectiveness of leymus chinensis silage fermentation.
AB  == five lab strains were evaluated using the acid production ability test, morphological observation, gram staining, physiological, biochemical and acid tolerance tests. all five strains (lp1, lp2, lp3, lc1 and lc2) grew at ph 4.0, and lp1 grew at 15 degrees c. strains lp1, lp2 and lp3 were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, whereas lc1 and lc2 were classified as lactobacillus casei by sequencing 16s rdna. the five isolated strains and two commercial inoculants (ps and cl) were added to native grass and leymus chinensis (trin.) tzvel. for ensiling. all five isolated strains decreased the ph and ammonia nitrogen content, increased the lactic acid content and lp1, lp2 and lp3 increased the acetic content and lactic/acetic acid ratio of l. chinensis silage  significantly. the five isolated strains and two commercial inoculants decreased  the butyric acid content of the native grass silage. lp2 treatment had lower butyric acid content and ammonia nitrogen content than the other treatments. the  five isolated strains improved the quality of l. chinensis silage. the five isolated strains and the two commercial inoculants were not effective in improving the fermentation quality of the native grass silage, but lp2 performed  better comparatively. significance and impact of the study: leymus chinensis is an important grass in china and russia, being the primary grass of the short grassland 'steppe' regions of central asia. however, it has been difficult to make high-quality silage of this species because of low concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates (wsc). isolating and evaluating lactic acid bacteria  strains will be helpful for improving the silage quality of this extensively grown species.

AB  == purpose: to evaluate a therapeutic efficacy of probiotics mixture (probiotics) in the treatment of children with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (ad). methods:  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial with a washout period of 2 weeks and an intervention period for 6 weeks, conducted from november 2010 to october 2011. one hundred children with mild to moderate ad (2-9 years old) were randomly allocated to the probiotics (lactobacilluss casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and bifidobacterium lactis) or  placebo groups. the assessment of efficacy was based on the change in eczema area severity index (easi), visual analogue scale for pruritus (vasp), fecal cell counts of each strains (log10[cell counts/g stool]), and serum cytokine levels (interleukin-4 [il-4]; il-10; tumor necrosis factor alpha, [tnf-alpha]) in weeks  0 and 6. results: demographics and baseline characteristics at the week 0 were not significantly different between the 2 groups. the significant increments in fecal-cell counts were observed in the probiotcs group at week 6 (p=0.00), while  the cytokine levels between the 2 groups were not significantly different in week 6 (il-4, p=0.50; il-10, p=0.58; tnf-alpha, p=0.82). the probiotics significantly  improved clinical severity after 6 weeks' intervention of probiotics; however, the placebo group also showed significant improvement (easi; p=0.00, vasp; p=0.00). conclusions: our findings showed that probiotics successfully colonized  in the intestine after 6 weeks' intervention; nevertheless, we could not find an  additional therapeutic or immunomodulatory effects on the treatment of ad. further long-term studies will be necessary to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of probiotics.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence  microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms,  likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.

TI  == behaviour of lactic acid bacteria populations in pecorino di carmasciano cheese samples submitted to environmental conditions prevailing in the gastrointestinal  tract: evaluation by means of a polyphasic approach.
AB  == the survival of the autochthonous microflora, of samples collected during pecorino di carmasciano cheese manufacturing, was evaluated along the passage through a model mimicking the gastro-intestinal tract. the aim was the selection  of lactic acid bacteria potentially able to arrive alive and metabolically active to the colon. the dynamics of lactic microbiota, throughout simulated digestion of cheese samples, were evaluated by means of an approach pcr-dgge-based. dominant species after cheese digestion could be related to the lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei groups. sixty-three strains, which survived to  simulated gastro-intestinal transit, were further evaluated for technological features and tolerance to human digestion in several experimental conditions, according to routinely used protocols. bacterial survival appeared to be, more than strain-specific, strongly affected by experimental conditions, i.e. some strains showed an acceptable survival when resuspended in skim milk but not in ewe milk and vice versa. nevertheless according to data, one gram of fresh pecorino di carmasciano cheese may convey to human colon about the same amount of viable lab of a probiotic drink. although it cannot be assumed that lactobacilli  introduced with pecorino have beneficial effects on the host, the healthy impact  of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria of naturally fermented food has a broad consensus in the current literature.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == [identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  == objective: to identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. methods: labs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16s rrna sequence. genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr). the sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all lab isolates by kirby-bauer paper diffusion (k-b method). meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (args), including erythromycin resistance genes (erma and ermb) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetm, tetk, tets, tetq, teto, tetl and tetw), were detected by pcr amplification in the identified lab isolates. the pcr products were confirmed by sequencing. results: total 100 labs were isolated, including 23 lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 lactobacillus casei, 30 streptococcus thermophilus, 5 lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 lactobacillus paracasei. the drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates  were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. moreover, 5 args were  found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermb gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet k in 4 isolates, tetl in 2 isolates, tetm in 4 isolates, teto in 2  isolates. erm a, tet s, tet q and tet w genes were not detected in the isolates.  antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. conclusions: some labs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus. all the lab isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. we proved again that lab could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.

TI  == immunostimulatory cpg motifs in the genomes of gut bacteria and their role in human health and disease.
AB  == toll-like receptor (tlr) signalling plays an important role in epithelial and immune cells of the intestine. tlr9 recognizes unmethylated cpg motifs in bacterial dna, and tlr9 signalling maintains the gut epithelial homeostasis. here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the frequency of cpg motifs in the genomes of gut commensal bacteria across major bacterial phyla. the frequency of potentially immunostimulatory cpg motifs (all cpg hexamers) or purine-purine-cg-pyrimidine-pyrimidine hexamers was linearly dependent on the genomic g+c content. we found that species belonging to proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria (including bifidobacteria) carried high counts of gtcgtt, the optimal motif stimulating human tlr9. we also found that enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, whose strains have been marketed as probiotics, had high counts of gtcgtt motifs. as gut bacterial species differ significantly in their genomic content of cpg motifs, the overall load of cpg motifs in the intestine depends on the species assembly of microbiota and their cell numbers. the optimal cpg motif content of microbiota may depend on the host's physiological status and, consequently, on an adequate level of tlr9 signalling. we speculate that microbiota with increased numbers of microbes with cpg motif-rich dna could better support mucosal functions in healthy individuals and improve the t-helper  1 (th1)/th2 imbalance in allergic diseases. in autoimmune disorders, cpg motif-rich dna could, however, further increase the th1-type immune responsiveness. estimation of the load of microbe-associated molecular patterns,  including cpg motifs, in gut microbiota could shed new light on host-microbe interactions across a range of diseases.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. this effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. the present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. the agar spot test  was used to show that twenty lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica. this inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in ph resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. the inhibition of y. enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei c1 and lactobacillus plantarum c4, was also associated with the ph decrease. however, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with l. plantarum c4, which exerted a partial protective effect against s. typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains.

AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == anti-hiv-1 activity, protease inhibition and safety profile of extracts prepared  from rhus parviflora.
AB  == background: in the present study, extracts prepared from the leaves of rhus parviflora roxb. (anacardiaceae) were evaluated for their anti-hiv activity, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. methods: aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts prepared from leaves of the plant were tested for their cytotoxicity and anti-hiv property using reporter gene based assays as well as human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). further these extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit hiv-1 reverse transcriptase (rt) and protease activity. safety profile of the extracts was determined on viability of lactobacillus sp., secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by vaginal keratinocytes and transepithelial resistance. results: both aqueous (ic50 = 15 mug/ml) and 50% ethanolic (ic50 = 26 mug/ml) extracts prepared from leaves of r. parviflora showed anti-hiv activity in tzm-bl cells wherein the virus was treated with the extracts prior to infection. further, both the extracts also inhibited virus load in hiv infected cem-gfp cells and human pbls. the anti-hiv activity is mediated through inhibition of hiv-1 protease activity. both the extracts did not disturb the integrity of monolayer formed by intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells. the extracts when tested up to 100 mug/ml did not significantly reduce the viability of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. the extracts (100 mug/ml) did not reveal any cytotoxic effect on vaginal keratinocytes (vk2/e6e7). levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by vk2/e6e7 cells treated with both the plant extracts were within the non-inflammatory range. conclusions: the studies reported herein showed in vitro anti-hiv activity and preliminary safety profile  of the extracts prepared from the leaves of r. parviflora.

TI  == [microorganisms effect with probiotic potential in water quality and growth of the shrimp litopenaeus vannamei (decapoda: penaeidae) in intensive culture].
AB  == the use of probiotics has gained acceptance in aquaculture, particularly in maintaining water quality and enhancing growth in organisms. this study analyzed  the effect of the commercial (em, japan) natural product composed by (rhodopseudomonas palustris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces cerevisiae) added to the water, in order to determine its effect in water quality, sediment and growth of l. vannamei under intensive culture. the evaluation included three treatments with a weekly addition of em: i) tanks without probiotics (c), ii) tanks with a dose of 4 l/ha (em1) and iii) tanks with a dose of 10 l/ha (em2). the treatment c was carried out three times, while treatments em1 and em2 were carried out four times. a total of 4 350 shrimps were measured for total length and weight, to calculate total and porcentual weight gain, daily weight gain, specific growth rate (tce), and food conversion factor (fca); besides, the survival rate was estimated. the use of probiotics allowed a  shorter harvest time in treatments em1 (90 d) and em2 (105 d) with relation to the treatment c (120d). treatments em1 and em2 were within the recommended intervals for culture, with respect to treatment c. the use of probiotic bacteria significantly regulated ph (em1, 8.03 +/- 0.33; em2, 7.77 +/- 0.22; c, 9.08 +/- 0.35) and reduced nitrate concentration (em1, 0.64 +/- 0.25 mg/l; em2, 0.39 +/- 0.26 mg/l; c, 0.71 mg/l). water ph mostly explained the variance with respect to  the treatments. treatment em2 presented the greatest removal of organic matter (1.77 +/- 0.45%), whereas the contents of extractable phosphorus increased significantly in treatment em1 with 21.6 +/- 7.99 mg/kg and in treatment em2 with 21.6 +/- 8.45 mg/kg with control relation (14.3 +/- 5.47). the shrimp growth was  influenced by dissolved oxygen, salinity and ph in the sediment, establishing that salinity was the most important variable in the weight with a negative association. treatment em1 recorded an improved tce (2.69 +/- 0.35%/d) and fca (1.46 +/- 0.20) with relation to the control treatment (tce, 1.88 +/- 0.25%/d; fca, 2.13 +/- 0.48). survival was significantly greater in treatments containing  probiotics with 61 +/- 8.76% and 60 +/- 10.5% for em1 and em2, respectively. this study indicated the positive effect obtained with the use of this commercial probiotic, to improve culture conditions and growth parameters in an intensive culture of l. vannamei.

TI  == a review on traditional turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages: microbiota, fermentation process and quality characteristics.
AB  == shalgam juice, hardaliye, boza, ayran (yoghurt drink) and kefir are the most known traditional turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages. the first three are  obtained from vegetables, fruits and cereals, and the last two ones are made of milk. shalgam juice, hardaliye and ayran are produced by lactic acid fermentation. their microbiota is mainly composed of lactic acid bacteria (lab).  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei in shalgam fermentation and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum in hardaliye fermentation are predominant. ayran is traditionally prepared by mixing yoghurt with water and salt. yoghurt starter cultures are used in industrial ayran production. on the other hand, both alcohol and lactic acid fermentation occur in boza and kefir. boza is prepared by using a mixture of maize, wheat and rice or their flours and  water. generally previously produced boza or sourdough/yoghurt are used as starter culture which is rich in lactobacillus spp. and yeasts. kefir is prepared by inoculation of raw milk with kefir grains which consists of different species  of yeasts, lab, acetic acid bacteria in a protein and polysaccharide matrix. the  microbiota of boza and kefir is affected from raw materials, the origin and the production methods. in this review, physicochemical properties, manufacturing technologies, microbiota and shelf life and spoilage of traditional fermented beverages were summarized along with how fermentation conditions could affect rheological properties of end product which are important during processing and storage.

TI  == effect of aloe vera juice on growth and activities of lactobacilli in-vitro.
AB  == in present investigation, different concentrations of aloe vera juice incorporated into the growth media of lactobacilli were tested to observe the effect on growth and activities of these bacteria. from the results obtained, it  was observed that aloe vera juice at a concentration of 5% v/v was effective in promoting the growth of l. acidophilus, l. plantarum and l. casei, as evident from the fall in ph and increased acidity, as well as from the improved generation time. at 15 to 25% concentration, growth was unaffected as compared to the controls; however, concentration higher than 25%v/v discouraged the growth. overall, it was concluded that aloe vera juice or gel at a particular concentration could possibly be used in combination with probiotic lactobacillus  strain(s) as a combinational therapy for gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == immunomodulatory and anti-allergic effects of orally administered lactobacillus species in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.
AB  == we investigated the effects of orally administered probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus species) as allergic immune modulators in ovalbumin (ova)-sensitized mice. balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with ova twice at a 2-week interval for allergy sensitization. the mice were then orally administered lactobacillus casei yit9029 (l1), l. casei hy7201 (l2), l. brevis hy7401 (l3), or l. plantarum hy20301 (l4) every 2 days for 3 weeks. total ige levels significantly decreased in sera of l3-administered mice but increased in the other groups. ova-specific ige levels decreased slightly in sera of mice administered l1, l3, and l4 but increased significantly in l2-administered mice.  in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca) using sera from administered mice, only the l3-administered group showed reaction inhibition. high expression of tlr-2 with interferon (ifn)-gamma stimulation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurred in l3- or l4-administered mice. th1 cytokines, including ifn-gamma and interleukin (il)- 12, increased in splenocytes of l3-administered mice; however,  il-4 decreased in l1- and l4-administered groups; il-5 decreased in all experimental groups. il-6 decreased in the l3-administered group; and il-10 decreased in l1-, l2-, and l3-administered groups. l3 induced antiallergic effects by increasing th1 cytokines, decreasing th2 cytokines, and inhibiting the pca reaction, whereas l2 administration increased allergic effects.

TI  == significant effect of ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. reconstituted skim milk (rsm) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. in addition to proteins and carbohydrate, rsm is rich in calcium. it is not clear which component is critical in the rsm protection mechanism. this study investigated the independent effect of calcium. ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of lactobacillus rhamnosus zy, lactobacillus casei zhang, lactobacillus plantarum p8 and streptococcus thermophilus nd03. the results showed that certain ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the lab strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. in some cases, the improvements were dramatic. more scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. in the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with ca(2+) added as a prime factor.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == strain-level characterization of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in norvegia cheese by high-resolution melt analysis.
AB  == the nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) constitute an important microbial group found during cheese ripening and they are thought to be fundamental to the  quality of cheese. rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for nslab are important for cheese quality control and in understanding the cheese ripening process. here, we present a novel rapid approach for strain-level characterization through combined 16s rrna gene and repetitive sequence-based high-resolution melt analysis (hrm). the approach was demonstrated through the characterization of 94  isolates from norvegia, a gouda-type cheese. the hrm profiles of the v1 and v3 variable regions of the 16s rrna gene of the isolates were compared with the hrm  profiles of 13 reference strains. the hrm profile comparison of the v1 and v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene allowed discrimination of isolates and reference strains. among the cheese isolates, lactobacillus casei/paracasei (62 isolates) and lactobacillus plantarum/lactobacillus pentosus (27 isolates) were the dominant species, whereas lactobacillus curvatus/lactobacillus sakei were found occasionally (5 isolates). the hrm profiling of repetitive sequence-based pcr using the (gtg)(5) primer was developed for strain-level characterization. the clustering analysis of the hrm profiles showed high discriminatory power, similar to that of cluster analysis based on the gel method. in conclusion, the hrm approach in this study may be applied as a fast, accurate, and reproducible method for characterization of the nslab microflora in cheese and may be applicable to other microbial environments following selective plate culturing.

AB  == the nonstarter lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus plantarum cc3m8, lactobacillus  paracasei cc3m35, and lactobacillus casei lc01, previously isolated from aged caciocavallo pugliese cheese or used in cheesemaking, were used as adjunct cultures (ac) or attenuated (by sonication treatment) adjunct cultures (aac) for  the manufacture of caciocavallo pugliese cheese on an industrial scale. preliminary studies on the kinetics of growth and acidification and activities of several enzymes of aac were characterized in vitro. as shown by the fluorescence  determination of live versus dead or damaged cells and other phenotype features,  attenuation resulted in a portion of the cells being damaged and a portion of the cells being capable of growing with time. compared with the control cheese (without adjunct cultures) and the cheese with aac, the addition of ac resulted in a lower ph after manufacture, which altered the gross composition of the cheese. as shown by plate count and confirmed by random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr, the 3 species of nonstarter lactobacilli persisted during ripening but the number of cultivable cells varied between ac and aac. slight differences were found between cheeses regarding primary proteolysis. the major differences between cheeses were the accumulation of free amino acids and the activity levels of several enzymes, which were highest in the caciocavallo pugliese cheeses made with the addition of aac. as shown by triangle test, the sensory properties of the cheese made with aac at 45 d did not differ from those  of the control caciocavallo pugliese cheese at 60 d of ripening. in contrast, the cheese made with ac at 45 d differed from both the caciocavallo pugliese cheese without adjuncts and the cheese made with aac. attenuated adjunct cultures are suitable for accelerating the ripening of caciocavallo pugliese cheese without modifying the main features of the traditional cheese.

TI  == investigation of antibacterial, acid and bile tolerance properties of lactobacilli isolated from koozeh cheese.
AB  == lactobacillus strains are a major part of the probiotics, microflora of the intestine and of fermented dairy products, and are found in a variety of environments. the aim of this study was to find out the ability of bile and acid  tolerance and antibacterial properties of the twenty eight isolates of three group lactobacilli namely lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus delbruki. for this purpose twenty eight different lactobacillus strains that isolated from koozeh cheese as a traditional cheese were screened. the acid tolerance test was studied under ph 2.0 and 3.0 with 7.5 as control. the cell count for the acid tolerance test was obtained at an interval of 0, 1, 2 and 3 hours respectively and was pour plated on man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) agar to be incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. all cells were selected for bile tolerance test in mrs broth containing bile concentrations of 0% as control and 0.3% as test. then cell counts were enumerated after 24 hours of incubation on mrs agar. results showed twenty seven isolates did not have ability to tolerate acid and bile salts and antimicrobial activity against four indicator bacteria included eshirichia coli, listeria monocytogenesis, bacillus cereus, salmonella entritidis. only one isolate namely lactobacillus casei could tolerate acid and bile salt and had antibacterial activity against of l. monocytogenesis. therefore we can consider this strain as a native probiotic but extra examinations was required.

TI  == recombinant production of hyperthermostable celb from pyrococcus furiosus in lactobacillus sp.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are used widespread in the food industry as traditional starters for various fermented foods. for recombinant protein production, lab would be superior with view from the food safety demands since most of them are generally recognized as safe organisms. we investigated the two  psip expression systems, psip403 and psip409 (sorvig et al. 2005), to produce a hyper-thermophilic beta-glycosidase (celb) from pyrococcus furiosus in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 and lactobacillus casei as hosts, respectively. both  lactobacilli harboring the psip409-celb vector produced active celb in batch bioreactor cultivations (mrs medium) while the specific celb activity of the cell free extract was about 44 % higher with l. plantarum (1,590 +/- 90 nkat/mg(protein)) than with l. casei (1,070 +/- 66 nkat/mg(protein)) using p-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (pnpgal) as the substrate. a fed-batch bioreactor  cultivation of l. plantarum nc8 psip409-celb resulted in a specific celb activity of 2,500 +/- 120 nkat ( pnpgal)/mg(protein) after 28 h. a repeated dosage of the  inducer spp-ip did not increase the enzyme expression further. as alternative for the cost intensive mrs medium, a basal whey medium with supplements (yeast extract, tween 80, nh(4)-citrate) was developed. in bioreactor cultivations using this medium, about 556 +/- 29 nkat ( pnpgal)/mg(protein) of celb activity was achieved. it was shown that both lab were potential expression hosts for recombinant enzyme production. the psip expression system can be applied in l. casei.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
AB  == background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii,  and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

TI  == double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  == background: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in newborns weighing <1500 g. methods: we studied a group of  150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacteruim infantis, streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of january 2007 through june 2010. clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. results: the primary outcome was the development of nec. both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or bifidobacteria growth. no differences were detected in terms of nec risk reduction (rr: 0.54, 95% ci 0.21 to 1.39) although  we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of nec frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. when the combined risk of nec or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (rr: 0.39, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. conclusions: probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of nec in preterm newborns.

TI  == immunomodulatory effects of potential probiotics in a mouse peanut sensitization  model.
AB  == peanut allergy accounts for the majority of severe food-related allergic reactions and there is a need for new prevention and treatment strategies. probiotics may be considered for treatment on the basis of their immunomodulating properties. cytokine profiles of probiotic strains were determined by in vitro co-culture with human pbmcs. three strains were selected to investigate their prophylactic potential in a peanut sensitization model by analysing peanut-specific antibodies, mast cell degranulation and ex vivo cytokine production by splenocytes. the probiotic strains induced highly variable cytokine profiles in pbmcs. l. salivarius hmi001, l. casei shirota (lcs) and l. plantarum  wcfs1 were selected for further investigation owing to their distinct cytokine patterns. prophylactic treatment with both hmi001 and lcs attenuated the th2 phenotype (reduced mast cell responses and ex vivo il-4 and/or il-5 production).  in contrast, wcfs1 augmented the th2 phenotype (increased mast cell and antibody  responses and ex vivo il-4 production). in vitro pbmc screening was useful in selecting strains with anti-inflammatory and th1 skewing properties. in case of hmi001 (high il-10/il-12 ratio) and lcs (high interferon-gamma and il-12), partial protection was seen in a mouse peanut allergy model. strikingly, certain  strains may worsen the allergic reaction as shown in the case of wcfs1.

TI  == characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in pdo salers cheese.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making pdo salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. gerles from ten farms producing pdo salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least  4 periods spread over two years. they were distinguished by their levels of lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log cfu/cm(2)), gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log cfu/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log cfu/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log cfu/cm(2)). they were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. these 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). the farm gerles were not contaminated by salmonella, listeria monocytogenes or staphylococcus aureus. only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in the 40 l experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. using 40 l experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. they were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hilgardii,...), gram positive catalase positive bacteria (curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, curtobacterium oceanosedimentum citrococcus spp., brachybacterium rhamnosum, kocuria rhizophila, arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (kluyveromyces lactis, kluyveromyces marxianus). in less than  1 min, even in a 500 l farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.

TI  == biodiversity of antifungal lactic acid bacteria isolated from raw milk samples from cow, ewe and goat over one-year period.
AB  == antifungal lactic acid bacteria (alab) biodiversity was evaluated in raw milk from ewe, cow and goat over one year period. lactic acid bacteria were enumerated using 8 semi-selective media, and systematically screened for their antifungal activity against 4 spoilage fungi commonly encountered in dairy products. depending on the selective medium, between 0.05% (elliker agar) and 5.5% (lamvab  agar) screened colonies showed an antifungal activity. the great majority of these active colonies originated from cow (49%) and goat (43%) milks, whereas only 8% were isolated from ewe milk. penicillium expansum was the most frequently inhibited fungus with 48.5% of colonies active against p. expansum among the 1235 isolated, followed by mucor plumbeus with 30.6% of active colonies, kluyveromyces lactis with only 12.1% of active colonies and pichia anomala with 8.7% of active  colonies. in the tested conditions, 94% of the sequenced active colonies belonged to lactobacillus. among them, targeted fungal species differed according to the lactobacillus group, whose presence largely depended on year period and milk origin. the lb. casei and lb. reuteri groups, predominantly recovered in summer/fall, were overrepresented in the population targeting m. plumbeus, whereas isolates from the lb. plantarum group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting k. lactis, the ones belonging to the lb. buchneri group, predominantly recovered in spring, were overrepresented in the population targeting p. anomala. raw milk, especially cow and goat milks from the summer/fall period appeared to be a productive reservoir for antifungal  lactobacilli.

TI  == newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with probiotic features for potential application in food industry.
AB  == five newly isolated lactic acid bacteria were identified as weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecium, and three different strains of lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rrna sequencing. essential probiotic requirements of these isolates such as tolerance to phenol, low ph, high sodium chloride, and bile salt concentration were checked. efficiency in adherence to mucin and hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell were also evaluated by in vitro studies. antimicrobial activities  against some pathogens were tried, and the sensitivity of these strains against 25 different antibiotics was also checked. further studies revealed weissella and enterococcus as substantial producers of folic acid. folate is involved as a cofactor in many metabolic reactions, and it has to be an essential component in  the human diet. the folate level in the fermented samples was determined by microbiological assay using lactobacillus casei ncim 2364 as indicator strain. the three strains of l. plantarum showed significant inhibitory activity against  various fungi that commonly contaminate food stuffs indicating their potential as a biopreservative of food material.

TI  == does the applicability of bacillus strains in probiotics rely upon their taxonomy?
AB  == the taxonomic position and biological activities of two bacillus strains used in  veterinary probiotics were studied in this work. these microorganisms inhibit growth of a broad spectrum of pathogenic cultures. they synthesize proteolytic enzymes and other biologically active metabolites, and to some extent, supplement each other with probiotic activities. it is not clear whether these versatile activities are properties of individual strains or bacterial taxa as whole. 16s rrna comparisons were conducted and illustrated the relatedness of these strains  to bacillus amyloliquefaciens . their cell wall fatty acid contents were consequently analysed and specified a relation to the " bacillus velezensis " ecomorph. on account of the previous observations, a simple method of 16s rrna profiling by polymorphic nucleotides was proposed to determine a group of organisms closely related to "b. velezensis" and b. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum, for they are biologically active strains suitable for use in biotechnology. the extreme genetic plasticity of these bacteria endowed each strain with a unique spectrum of antagonistic activity.

AB  == this study investigated the effects of a mixed bacterial inoculant possessing ferulic acid esterase (fae) activity on silage fermentation characteristics, aerobic stability, and growth performance of growing feedlot steers. whole-crop barley (hordeum vulgare l.) forage (35% dm) was chopped and ensiled without a silage inoculant (un) or with a mixed bacterial culture containing 1.0 x 10(11) cfu/g of lactobacillus buchneri ln4017 that produces fae, 2.0 x 10(10) cfu/g of lactobacillus plantarum lp7109, and 1.0 x 10(10) cfu/g of lactobacillus casei lc3200 at a combined rate of 1.3 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh forage (in) in mini and ag-bag (ag-bag int. ltd., warrenton, or) silos. silages from the mini silos were  assessed for the effect of inoculation on fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability, whereas silages from ag-bags were used to formulate 2 barley silage-based total mixed rations (un and in) that were fed to growing feedlot steers for 112 d. the in silage exhibited a homolactic fermentation during the first 7 d of ensiling as reflected by an increased (p </= 0.02) lactic acid concentration and an accelerated rate (p < 0.01) of ph decline. thereafter, fermentation of in silage became more heterolactic, resulting in greater concentrations of acetic acid (p < 0.01) and ph (p < 0.01) but less (p < 0.01) lactic acid than un silage. inoculation did not affect dm losses (p = 0.52) from  mini silos. the in silage remained stable during 21 d, but temperature and yeasts counts in the un silage increased after 5 d of aerobic exposure. growing steers fed the in silage diet had superior (p = 0.03) feed conversion efficiency compared with those fed un silage. inoculation of whole-crop barley silage with a mixed culture of homolactic lactic acid-producing bacteria and fae-producing l. buchneri at ensiling changed fermentation from a homolactic to a heterolactic form during ensiling and improved aerobic stability of the silage and efficiency  of bw gain of growing feedlot steers.

AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

AB  == the potential of water extracts of the amazon medicinal plant chancapiedra (phyllanthus niruri l.) from ecuador and peru for antimicrobial activity against  helicobacter pylori and different strains of lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum was investigated. h. pylori was inhibited by both water extracts in a dose dependent  manner, whereas lactic acid bacterial growth was not affected. both extracts contained ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and exhibited high free radical scavenging linked-antioxidant activities (89%). however, gallic acid was detected only in the ecuadorian extract. preliminary studies on the mode of action of chancapiedra against h. pylori revealed that inhibition may not involve proline dehydrogenase-based oxidative phosphorylation inhibition associated with  simple mono-phenolics and could involve ellagitannins or other non-phenolic compounds through a yet unknown mechanism. this study provides evidence about the potential of chancapiedra for h. pylori inhibition without affecting beneficial lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  == the health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (dc). most lactobacilli strains, including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong il-12 and tnf-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. in contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low il-12 and tnf-alpha inducers. il-10 and il-6 levels showed less  variation and no correlation with il-12 and tnf-alpha. dc matured by strong il-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (ifn)-beta. when combining two strains, low il-12 inducers inhibited this ifn-beta production as well as il-12 and th1-skewing chemokines. the ifn-beta induction was mediated through c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) irrespective of the stimulating strain. the inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-jun dimerization protein (jdp)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of jnk. our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects.  this underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.

TI  == macrolide resistance and in vitro selection of resistance to antibiotics in lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == spreading of resistance to antibiotics is of great concern due to the increasing  rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. since commensal bacteria may transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on development of resistance should include also lactobacilli. resistance to macrolides, penicillins and tetracycline was determined in 40 isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus crispatus, and lactobacillus  casei isolated from faeces of apparently healthy volunteers. frequency of mutation and changes in susceptibility after serial exposure to these antibiotics at concentrations of 4x and 8x mic were evaluated in susceptible isolates. acquired resistance was defined as an increment in mic values of at least four times in respect to the pre-selection values. resistance to macrolides and/or tetracycline was identified in 14 and 4 isolates, respectively. ermb gene and a2058g mutation in 23s rrna were detected in macrolide resistant isolates. frequencies of mutation of susceptible isolates (n=26) were lower for ampicillin  and erythromycin than for tetracycline. serial exposure to antibiotics led to selection of resistant mutants. however, acquired resistance was rather unstable  and was lost after subcultures in antibiotic-free medium in most mutants. resistance to erythromycin was associated to a a2058g mutation in 23s rrna. in conclusion, results indicate that resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is present among intestinal lactobacilli. decrease in susceptibility following serial exposure to antibiotics might occur in lactobacilli, in a strain- and antibiotic-dependent way. since lactobacilli are often used as probiotics, their  ability to acquire resistance should be evaluated for isolates candidate to be included in probiotics based products.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characterisation of ting, a sorghum-based sourdough  product from botswana.
AB  == ting is a fermented sorghum product of botswana which is used to prepare porridges of different consistencies. this study aimed to characterise ting with  respect to fermentation microbiota and metabolite composition, and to develop starter cultures for ting fermentation. the ph values of 10 ting samples from botswana ranged between 3.5 and 4.0 and cell counts ranged between 1.2x10(8) and  1.2x10(10)cfu/g lactic acid bacteria. yeast cell counts were below 10(5)cfu/g in  all samples and enterobacteriaceae were less than 10 cfu/g. the microbiota of samples consisted of 2-4 dominant strains and strains were identified based on the sequence of their 16s rrna genes as lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus harbinensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus coryniformis. binary strain combinations were employed as starter cultures to produce ting. major fermentation products were lactate, acetate and ethanol, additionally, 1,2 propanediol and 1,3 propanediol were produced by some strains. all strains were capable of producing ting, which was accompanied by a decrease in ph from 6.3 to  4 within 8h. traditionally processed ting requires 2 to 3 days to attain a ph below 4; the starter cultures thus reduced the fermentation time to 8h.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == modulation of th1/th2 balance by lactobacillus strains isolated from kimchi via stimulation of macrophage cell line j774a.1 in vitro.
AB  == lactobacilli isolated from kimchi, a korean traditional food, were tested for their capacity to modulate the t helper (th) 1/th2 balance. ovalbumin (ova)-sensitized mouse splenocytes were cultured with 26 strains of lactobacilli; the highest il-12 induction and lowest il-4 production were then observed in 4 strains, including lactobacillus plantarum cjlp55, cjlp56, cjlp133, and cjlp136.  these strains produced a larger amount of il-12, which enhances differentiation and activation of th1 cells, in macrophage cell-lines more than positive control  strains l. casei kctc 3109(t) and l. rhamnosus gg, although they also induced production of il-10, which is a suppressor of il-12. indeed, cjlp133-stimulated macrophages induced production of more th1 cytokine ifn-gamma and less th2 cytokine il-4 than kctc 3109(t) and gg in co-cultivation with t cells. these findings suggest that lactobacilli from kimchi may modulate the th1/th2 balance via macrophage activation in the hypersensitive reaction caused by th2 cells. practical application: allergic reactions including asthma and atopy are caused by predominance of th2 response over th1 response. lactobacilli isolated from fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese, and kimchi showed health-promoting activities. the present study indicated that several lactobacilli strains from kimchi may reduce allergic reactions through macrophage-mediated induction of th1 response.

TI  == simplification of a complex microbial antilisterial consortium to evaluate the contribution of its flora in uncooked pressed cheese.
AB  == a complex microbial consortium derived from raw milk and composed of populations  classified in 4 groups (lactic acid bacteria (a), gram positive catalase positive bacteria (b), gram negative bacteria (c) and yeasts (d)) can contribute to the inhibition of listeria monocytogenes in the core of an uncooked pressed cheese. to identify what groups may be involved in the inhibition, the consortium was simplified by successively omitting one group at a time. pasteurized milk was inoculated with these more or less complex consortia and their effects on l. monocytogenes count, ph, acids and volatile compounds in the core of uncooked pressed cheese were evaluated. the growth of l. monocytogenes was the highest in  cheeses prepared with pasteurized milk and only st. thermophilus. inhibition in other cheeses was expressed by comparison with growth in these ones. all the consortia containing both lactic acid bacteria (group a) and gram positive catalase positive bacteria (group b)--abcd, abd, abc, ab--were more inhibitory than those containing lactic acid bacteria on its own (a) or associated only with yeasts (ad) or/and gram negative (adc). consortia without lactic acid bacteria were weakly inhibitory or had no effect. gram positive catalase positive bacteria alone were not inhibitory although most of the species became established in the  cheeses. the lactobacillus population (lb. casei, lb. plantarum, lb. curvatus and lb. farciminis) was predominant in cheeses (9 log cfu/g) with a higher count than leuconostoc (7 log cfu/g) and enterococcus (7 log cfu/g). lactobacillus counts were negatively correlated with those of l. monocytogenes (r=-0.84 at 18 days) and with the level of d-lactic acid. there was no correlation between l. monocytogenes and leuconostoc or enterococcus counts. complex consortium abcd and ab not only had a stronger inhibitory power in cheeses than consortium ad, they were also associated with the highest levels of l-lactic and acetic acids. all cheeses inoculated with lactic acid bacteria differed from those without by higher levels of ethyl formiate, pentane and alcohols (2-butanol, 2-pentanol), and lower levels of ketones (2-hexanone, 2,3-butanedione) and aldehydes (2-methyl-butanal). levels of 2-methyl-butanal, 2-butanol and 2-pentanol were higher in abcd and ab cheeses than in ad cheeses. beside their contribution to the inhibition, their effect on cheese flavour must be evaluated.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == strain-specific immunomodulatory effects of lactobacillus plantarum strains on birch-pollen-allergic subjects out of season.
AB  == background: allergic diseases are increasing world-wide, and according to the hygiene hypothesis may be related to a decreased exposure to environmental bacteria. probiotic bacteria are recognized for their immunomodulating properties, and may benefit allergy patients. in vitro studies reveal immunomodulatory effects that are strain dependent. differential immunomodulatory in vitro capacities cannot be extrapolated directly to in vivo efficacy. thus, in vitro screening should preferably be followed by a comparative analysis of the selected immunomodulatory strains in an in vivo setting. objective: we selected five lactobacillus strains on their il-10-inducing capacity, and evaluated the immunomodulatory properties in birch-pollen-allergic subjects outside the hayfever season, with a reduction of il-13 as the primary outcome. methods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study was performed in which 62 subjects with a proven birch-pollen allergy consumed one of five different probiotic yoghurts containing four lactobacillus plantarum strains and one lactobacillus casei strain or a placebo yoghurt. blood samples were collected at  the start and after 4 weeks. several immune parameters were determined in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures (pbmc) derived from these subjects. results a decrease in birch-pollen-specific ige was found for four probiotic strains. l. casei shirota reduced the number of cd16(+) /cd56(+) cells  in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. for strain l. plantarum cbs125632, the decrease in ige coincided with significant decreases in il-5 and il-13 production by alphacd3/alphacd28-stimulated pbmc cultures. conclusion and clinical relevance: subjects with seasonal allergy can be used to determine immunomodulatory responses outside the pollen season within a 4-week study period. l. plantarum cbs125632 decreased several immune markers related to allergy, and may have the potential to alleviate the severity of seasonal allergy symptoms.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

TI  == diversity of stress tolerance in lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus  and lactobacillus paraplantarum: a multivariate screening study.
AB  == sixty-three strains of the taxonomically related species lactobacillus plantarum  subsp. plantarum, l. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, l. paraplantarum and l. pentosus isolated from sourdoughs and other food and non-food sources and 14 strains of other members of the genus lactobacillus were screened for their tolerance of acid, alkaline, heat, oxidative, osmotic, detergent and starvation stresses in order to evaluate the diversity of stress response. most strains of the l. plantarum group were highly tolerant of acid, alkaline and osmotic stress  and highly sensitive to detergent stress, while a larger diversity was found for  other stress. multivariate analysis allowed grouping the strains in clusters with similar response patterns. stress response patterns in the l. plantarum group were similar to those of species of the l. casei/l. paracasei group but clearly different from those of other mesophilic lactobacillus. no relationship was found between grouping obtained on the basis of stress response patterns and by genotypic fingerprinting (rep-pcr), nor with the taxonomic position or isolation  source of the strains. further experiments with selected strains showed that exponential phase cells were generally but not always more sensitive than stationary phase cells. the ability to grow under stressful conditions showed a slightly better correlation with the ecological conditions prevailing in the isolation niches of the strains. this study will be the basis for further investigations to identify and exploit the basis of diversity in the stress response of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == two strains of nonstarter lactobacilli increased the production of flavor compounds in soft cheeses.
AB  == the contribution to flavor generation and secondary proteolysis of 2 strains of mesophilic lactobacilli isolated from cheese was studied. miniature soft cheeses  (200 g) were produced with or without the inclusion of a culture of lactobacillus plantarum i91 or lactobacillus casei i90 in the starter composed of streptococcus thermophilus. during ripening, cheeses containing the added lactobacilli showed an increased content of total free amino acids, but this increase was only significant in cheeses with lb. plantarum i91. in addition, free amino acid profiles were modified by selective increases of some amino acids, such as asp, ser, arg, leu, and phe. cheeses inoculated with lb. plantarum i91 or lb. casei i90 were also characterized by a significantly higher concentration of diacetyl,  a key flavor compound, and an increased content of acetoin. results suggest an increase in the catabolism of either citrate or aspartate, with the production of the derived aroma compounds. overall, aspartate content increased in both lactobacilli-added cheeses, whereas citrate was more or less constant, suggesting that aspartate could be the source of increased diacetyl and acetoin. a triangle  aroma test showed that the addition of the lactobacilli strains significantly changed the sensory attributes of cheeses. at least 11 of 12 panelists commented  that the aroma of cheeses with adjuncts was more buttery than that of control cheeses, which is desirable in most soft cheeses. both lb. plantarum i91 and lb.  casei i90 performed well as adjunct cultures by influencing cheese aroma development and cheese proteolysis.

TI  == coexpression of bile salt hydrolase gene and catalase gene remarkably improves oxidative stress and bile salt resistance in lactobacillus casei.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) encounter various types of stress during industrial processes and gastrointestinal transit. catalase (cat) and bile salt hydrolase (bsh) can protect bacteria from oxidative stress or damage caused by bile salts by decomposing hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) or deconjugating the bile salts, respectively. lactobacillus casei is a valuable probiotic strain and is often deficient in both cat and bsh. in order to improve the resistance of l. casei to  both oxidative and bile salts stress, the catalase gene kata from l. sakei and the bile salt hydrolase gene bsh1 from l. plantarum were coexpressed in l. casei  hx01. the enzyme activities of cat and bsh were 2.41 mumol h(2)o(2)/min/10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) and 2.11 mumol glycine/min/ml in the recombinant l. casei cb, respectively. after incubation with 8 mm h(2)o(2), survival ratio of l. casei cb was 40-fold higher than that of l. casei ck. treatment of l. casei cb with various concentrations of sodium glycodeoxycholate (gdca) showed that ~10(5) cfu/ml cells survived after incubation with 0.5% gdca, whereas almost all the l.  casei ck cells were killed when treaded with 0.4% gdca. these results indicate that the coexpression of cat and bsh confers high-level resistance to both oxidative and bile salts stress conditions in l. casei hx01.

TI  == new method for electroporation of lactobacillus species grown in high salt.
AB  == we here describe a new method for electroporation of lactobacillus species, obligately homofermentative and facultatively heterofermentative, based on the cell-wall weakening resulting from growth in high-salt media. for l. casei, optimum transformation efficiency of up to 10(5) transformants per microgram of plasmid dna was achieved following growth in the presence of 0.9 m nacl. plasmids of different sizes and replication origins were also similarly transformed. these competent cells could be used either directly or stored frozen, up to 1 month, for future use, with similar efficiency. this protocol was assayed with different lactobacillus species: l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum and l. acidophilus, and it was found that they were transformed with similar efficiency.

TI  == phytase activity from lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.
AB  == the presence of phytate in calcium-fortified soymilk may interfere with mineral absorption. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce the enzyme phytase that degrades phytates and therefore may potentially improve mineral bioavailability and absorption. this study investigates the phytase activity and phytate degradation potential of 7 strains of lab including: lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4962, atcc33200, atcc4356, atcc4161, l. casei ascc290, l. plantarum ascc276,  and l. fermentum vri-003. activity of these bacteria was examined both in screening media and in calcium-fortified soymilk supplemented with potassium phytate. most strains produced phytase under both conditions with l. acidophilus  atcc4161 showing the highest activity. phytase activity in fortified soymilk fermented with l. acidophilus atcc4962 and l. acidophilus atcc4161 increased by 85% and 91%, respectively, between 12 h and 24 h of fermentation. all strains expressed peak phytase activity at approximately ph 5. however, no phytate degradation could be observed.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == robustness of lactobacillus plantarum starters during daily propagation of wheat  flour sourdough type i.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the robustness of selected sourdough strains of lactobacillus plantarum. seven strains were singly used as sourdough type i starters under daily back-slopping propagation (ten days) using wheat flour. cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied slightly (median values of 9.13-9.46 log cfu g(-1)) between and within started sourdoughs, as well as the acidifying activity (median values of 1.24-1.33). after three days also the control sourdough (unstarted) had the same values. as shown by rapd-pcr analysis, five (db200, 3dm, g10c3, 12h1 and lp20) out of seven strains maintained elevated  cell numbers (ca. 9 log cfu g(-1)) throughout ten days. the other two strains progressively decreased to less than 5 log cfu g(-1). as identified by partial sequencing of 16s rrna and reca genes, l. plantarum (11 isolates), pediococci (7), lactobacillus casei (3) and lactobacillus rossiae (2) dominated the flour microbiota. monitoring of lactic acid bacteria during sourdough propagation was carried out by culture dependent approach and using pcr-dgge (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). except for the sourdough started with l. plantarum lp20, in all other sourdoughs at least one autochthonous strain of l. plantarum emerged. all emerging strains of l. plantarum showed different rapd-pcr profiles. l. rossiae and pediococcus pentosaceus were only found in the control and sourdough  started with strain 12h1. the characterization of the catabolic profiles of sourdoughs (biolog system) showed that sourdoughs containing persistent starters  behaved similarly and their profiles were clearly differentiated from the others. one persistent strain (db200) of l. plantarum and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis  ls44, previously shown to be persistent (siragusa et al., 2009), were used as the mixed starter to produce a wheat flour sourdough. both strains cohabited and dominated during ten days of propagation.

TI  == the effect of ripening and storage conditions on the distribution of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine in edam-cheese.
AB  == the aim of the work was to describe the development of selected biogenic amines (histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine) in 4 layers of dutch-type cheese (edam-cheese) depending on 3 ripening/storage regimes during a 98-day period. biogenic amines were analysed by means of ion-exchange chromatography. a further  goal was to identify microbial sources of biogenic amines in the material analysed. phenotype characterization and repetitive sequence-based pcr fingerprinting were used to identify the isolated bacteria. the highest content of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine was determined in cheeses stored in a ripening cellar at a temperature of 10 degrees c during the whole observation period. lower biogenic amines content was determined in samples which were moved  into a cold storage device (5 degrees c) after 38 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees c). the lowest concentrations of biogenic amines were detected in cheeses which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees c) after 23 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees c). during the 98-day period, histamine was not detected in any of the regimes. within the cheeses analysed, non-starter lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum were detected as the main producers of the biogenic amines tested. in starter bacteria lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris the decarboxylase activity tested was not detected.

TI  == microbial products from probiotic bacteria inhibit salmonella enteritidis 857-induced il-8 synthesis in caco-2 cells.
AB  == oral administration of lactobacillus spp. as probiotics is gaining importance in  the treatment of intestinal inflammations. however, their mechanism of action is  unknown. we investigated whether nonspecific binding lactobacillus casei shirota  (lcs) and mannose-specific lactobacillus plantarum 299v (lp) and their spent culture supernatant (scs) affect salmonella enteritidis 857 (se) growth, il-8 and hsp70 syntheses. in one set of experiments human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells were infected with lcs, lp or se at 1-500 bacteria per cell for 1 h. in another set, cells were exposed to se (0-200 per cell, 1 h) after exposure to lactobacilli (lb) (500 per cell, 30 min) or by co-incubation of se and lb (1 h).  the third set of experiments involved exposure of cells for 1 h to scs or se (100 per cell) pretreated (1 h) in scs. the effect of lb scs on se growth was evaluated by agar plate diffusion test. il-8 and hsp70 were assessed over 2-24 h  using elisa and western blotting, respectively. neither lcs nor lp affected the se growth and il-8 production. in addition, they did not induce hsp70 expression  by caco-2 cells. instead, their scs inhibited the se growth and il-8 production and induced the expression of hsp70 by both crypt- and villus-like cells. the beneficial effect of lactobacillus spp. to the intestinal inflammations might be  associated with a decrease in il-8 levels. this effect could be mediated, at least in part, via a secreted antimicrobial product(s) either directly against the pathogens or indirectly through the synthesis of hsp70.

TI  == phenolic acids and flavonoids in nonfermented and fermented red sorghum (sorghum  bicolor (l.) moench).
AB  == this study aimed to identify phenolic acids and flavonoids in the red sorghum variety pan 3860 and to determine changes in their concentrations during fermentation with lactobacilli. sorghum sourdoughs fermented with two binary strain combinations, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri , were compared to chemically acidified controls. four glycerol esters were tentatively identified, caffeoylglycerol, dicaffeoylglycerol, coumaroyl-caffeoylglycerol, and coumaroyl-feruloylglycerol, that have previously not been detected in sorghum. chemical acidification resulted in hydrolysis of phenolic acid esters and flavonoid glucosides. during lactic fermentation, phenolic acids, phenolic acid esters, and flavonoid glucosides were metabolized. analysis of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and naringenin-glucoside contents in single-strain cultures of lactobacilli demonstrated that glucosidase, phenolic acid reductase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase activities contributed to polyphenol metabolism. this study demonstrates that microbial fermentation of sorghum affects the content of polyphenols and can influence the nutritional value and antimicrobial activity of sorghum.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == intragastric administration of a superoxide dismutase-producing recombinant lactobacillus casei bl23 strain attenuates dss colitis in mice.
AB  == human immune cells release large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ros) such as superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide via respiratory burst. in inflammatory bowel diseases, a sustained and abnormal activation of the immune response results in oxidative stress of the digestive tract and in a loss of intestinal homeostasis. we previously reported that heterologous production of the lactobacillus plantarum manganese catalase (mnkat) enhances the survival of lb. casei bl23 when exposed to oxidative stress. anti-inflammatory effects were observed after lb. casei bl23 oral administrations in moderate murine dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis, without added effects of the mnkat production. here, we evaluated the protective effects obtained by an improved antioxidative strategy. the lactococcus lactis soda gene was expressed in lb. casei bl23 which acquired an efficient manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) activity. the effects of lb. casei mnsod alone or in combination with lb. casei mnkat were compared first in eukaryotic cell pma-induced oxidative stress model and then in severe murine dss-induced colitis. based on ros production assays as  well as colonic histological scores, a significant reduction of both oxidative stress and inflammation was observed with lb. casei mnsod either alone or in combination with lb. casei mnkat. no added effect of the presence of lb. casei mnkat was observed. these results suggest that lb. casei bl23 mnsod could have anti-inflammatory effects on gut inflammation.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional cachaca fermentations.
AB  == during the production of traditional cachaca (alembic s cachaca), contamination of the fermented must is one of the factors leading to economic losses in the beverage manufacturing industry. the diversity of bacterial populations and the role of these microorganisms during the cachaca production process are still poorly understood in brazil. in our work, the fermentation process was followed in two distilleries located in the state of minas gerais. the objective of this work was to identify the populations of lactic acid bacteria present during cachaca fermentation using physiological and molecular methods. lactic acid bacteria were isolated in high frequencies during all of the fermentative processes, and lactobacillus plantarum and l. casei were the most prevalent species. other lactic acid bacteria were found in minor frequencies, such as l. ferintoshensis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. murinus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sp. and weissella confusa. these bacteria could contribute to the increase of volatile acidity levels or to the production of compounds that could  influence the taste and aroma of the beverage.

AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == intestinal lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == bacterial teichoic acids reverse predominant il-12 production induced by certain  lactobacillus strains into predominant il-10 production via tlr2-dependent erk activation in macrophages.
AB  == the cytokine response of macrophages to probiotic lactobacilli varies between strains, and the balance of il-10/il-12 production is crucial for determination of the direction of the immune response. to clarify the mechanism whereby lactobacillus strains differentially induce production of il-10 and il-12, we examined the potential relationship between cytokine production and mapk activation. in mouse peritoneal macrophages, lactobacillus plantarum potently induced il-10 but weakly induced il-12 production, whereas l. casei potently induced il-12 but weakly induced il-10 production. kinetic analysis of the activation of erk, p38, and jnk showed that l. plantarum induced a more rapid and intense activation of mapks, especially of erk, than l. casei. a selective blockade of erk activation induced by l. plantarum resulted in a decrease in il-10 production and a simultaneous increase in il-12 production. interestingly,  when macrophages were stimulated with a combination of l. plantarum and l. casei, il-10 production was induced synergistically. we identified cell wall teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid as key factors for triggering the synergistic induction of il-10 production, although these teichoic acids alone only weakly induced il-10 production. the effect of these teichoic acids on il-10 production  was mediated by tlr2-dependent erk activation. our data demonstrate that activation of the erk pathway is critical for determination of the balance of the il-10/il-12 response of macrophages to lactobacilli and that predominant il-12 production induced by certain lactobacilli such as l. casei can be converted into predominant il-10 production when stimulated in the presence of teichoic acids.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == probiotics: multifarious oral vaccine against infectious traumas.
AB  == microorganisms have been used for a long time in food and alcoholic fermentation. in the last few years they have undergone scientific scrutiny of their preventative and therapeutic aspects. this has led to the discovery of a new term, probiotics. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are microbial communities normally present in the intestine of most animals. they play an important role in humans and other animals, and act as immunomodulators. they are helpful in the treatment and prevention of disease as well as improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients. probiotic microorganisms include the lab lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. use of these live bacteria to elicit an immune response  or to carry a vaccine component is a new invention in vaccine development. the advantage of live bacterial vaccines is that they mimic natural infection, have intrinsic adjuvant properties and can be given orally. components of pathogenic and nonpathogenic food-related microorganisms are currently being evaluated as candidates for oral vaccines.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

TI  == an in vitro study on bacterial growth interactions and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion characteristics of probiotic combinations.
AB  == the aims of this study were to examine long-term growth interactions of five probiotic strains (lactobacillus casei 01, lactobacillus plantarum ha8, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 and bifidobacterium  lactis bb12) either alone or in combination with propionibacterium jensenii 702 in a co-culture system and to determine their adhesion ability to human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2. growth patterns of probiotic lactobacillus strains were not considerably affected by the presence of p. jensenii 702, whereas lactobacilli exerted a strong antagonistic action against p. jensenii 702. in the co-culture of bif. lactis bb12 and p. jensenii 702, a significant synergistic influence on growth of both bacteria was observed (p < 0.05). the results of adhesion assay showed that when probiotic strains were tested in combination, there was evidence of an associated effect on percentage adherence.  however, in most cases these differences were not statistically significant (p <  0.05). adhesion percentage of lb. casei 01 and lb. rhamnosus gg both decreased significantly in the presence of p. jensenii 702 compared to their adhesion levels when alone (p < 0.05). these results show that the survival and percentage adhesion of some probiotic strains may be influenced by the presence of other strains and this should be considered when formulating in the probiotic products.

TI  == gut health promoting activity of new putative probiotic/protective lactobacillus  spp. strains: a functional study in the small intestinal cell model.
AB  == in interaction studies with the host intestine, the use of the appropriate gut functional cell model is essential. therefore, we examined the protective properties of selected lactobacilli in a newly established intestinal cell model. bacteria were cocultured with the pig small intestinal epithelial cells (psic1) and pig blood monocytes (pom2) in a functional intestinal cell model. intercellular intestinal integrity was measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (ter), before and after coculture with selected bacterial strains. all selected bacterial strains showed important gut health promoting activity by: enhancing the intestinal integrity and increasing metabolic activity of intestinal cells. stimulation of immune response was strain specific. the best stimulants were unidentified lactobacillus strains obtained from fermented food in africa (pck87 and 66), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (pcs26). their activity was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of the commercial lactobacillus casei shirota strain.

TI  == peptidoglycan from lactobacilli inhibits interleukin-12 production by macrophages induced by lactobacillus casei through toll-like receptor 2-dependent and independent mechanisms.
AB  == we previously showed that lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion can stimulate macrophages to induce large a  quantity of interleukin-12 (il-12). in this study, we examined the influence of lactobacilli and bacterial cell wall components on il-12 production by macrophages that was induced by lactobacillus casei, which has a rigid cell wall. easily digestible lactobacilli such as lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus  plantarum or their intact cell walls (icws) weakly or very weakly induced il-12 production by macrophages, and inhibitedl. casei-induced il-12 production. while  the icw of l. casei was resistant to intracellular digestion and did not inhibit  l. casei-induced il-12 production, its polysaccharide-depleted icw, i.e. intact peptidoglycan, was sensitive to intracellular digestion and inhibited l. casei-induced il-12 production. furthermore, the peptidoglycans of l. johnsonii,  l. plantarum and staphylococcus aureus also inhibited l. casei-induced il-12 production. peptidoglycans from lactobacilli suppressed l. casei-induced expression of il-12p40 but not il-12p35 mrna. inhibition of il-12 production by peptidoglycan was mitigated in toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2)-deficient macrophages  compared with the inhibition in wild-type macrophages. a derivative of the minimal structural unit of peptidoglycan (6-o-stearoyl-muramyl dipeptide) recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (nod2) could also suppress l. casei-induced il-12 production. these findings demonstrate that easily digestible bacteria and peptidoglycan suppress il-12 production through pattern recognition receptors such as tlr2 and nod2. il-12 production in the gut  may be negatively regulated by the simultaneous inhibitory actions of various resident bacteria that are susceptible to intracellular digestion.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana, a traditional turkish fermented food.
AB  == tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in turkey. the aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated during processing of tarhana. samples were collected from eight different regions of turkey. in order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. a total of 226 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from mrs, m17 and  sbm (slanetz and bartley medium). the isolates were grouped and identified using  a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-pcr fingerprinting [(gtg)(5) primer], multiplex pcr, 16s rrna gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of  the isolates, 19% were identified as streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as enterococcus faecium, 7% as pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as weissella cibaria, 2% as lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as leuconostoc citreum, 1% as lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as lactobacillus casei. the different production sites investigated all had individual lab profiles, but with p. acidilactici and s. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. the main source of p. acidilactici and s.  thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.

TI  == isolation and basic characterization of a beta-glucosidase from a strain of lactobacillus brevis isolated from a malolactic starter culture.
AB  == aims: to study glycosidase activities of a lactobacillus brevis strain and to isolate an intracellular beta-glucosidase from this strain. methods and results:  lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a commercially available starter culture preparation for malolactic fermentation were tested for beta-glycosidase activities. a strain of lact. brevis showing high intracellular beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-xylosidase and alpha-l-arabinosidase activities was selected for purification and characterization of its beta-glucosidase. the pure  glucosidase from lact. brevis has also side activities of xylosidase, arabinosidase and cellobiosidase. it is a homotetramer of 330 kda and has an isoelectric point at ph 3.5. the k(m) for p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside is 0.22 and 1.14 mmol l(-1), respectively. the beta-glucosidase activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid delta-lactone, partially by glucose and gluconate, but not by fructose. ethanol and methanol were found to increase the activity up to twofold. the free  enzyme was stable at ph 7.0 (t(1/2) = 50 day) but not at ph 4.0 (t(1/2) = 4 days). conclusions: the beta-glucosidase from lact. brevis is widely different to that characterized from lactobacillus casei (coulon et al. 1998) and lactobacillus plantarum (sestelo et al. 2004). the high tolerance to fructose and ethanol, the low inhibitory effect of glucose on the enzyme activity and the good long-term stability could be of great interest for the release of aroma compounds during winemaking. significance and impact of the study: although the release of  aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated by several authors, little information exists on the responsible enzymes. this study contains the first characterization of an intracellular beta-glucosidase isolated from a wine-related strain of lact. brevis.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

AB  == in this review, we are listing lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. our literature searches led to the identification of 231 lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the siphoviridae family, 76 to the myoviridae family, and 1 to the podoviridae family. model phages infecting lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of lactobacillus hosts. to date, nine complete lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on lactobacillus phages is bright.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of rep3123 against clostridium difficile and other  anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the anaerobic spectrum of activity of rep3123, a novel diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl-trna synthetases in gram-positive bacteria. methods: fifty recent clinical isolates of clostridium difficile from patients diagnosed with c. difficile infection and 223 other intestinal normal flora anaerobes were tested for their susceptibility to rep3123 and four or five comparator agents by the agar dilution method using supplemented brucella agar with 5% laked sheep blood. results: all strains of c.  difficile were inhibited by 0.5-1 mg/l rep3123, including those resistant to moxifloxacin and clindamycin. rep3123 lacked activity against many normal flora anaerobes in the gut, including clostridium ramosum, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli of the lactobacillus casei-rhamnosus-plantarum group and gram-negative anaerobes. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated good potency against c. difficile, but limited  activity against many other intestinal anaerobic species, thus, in theory, maintaining the colonization resistance barrier.

TI  == isolation and preliminary probiotic selection of lactobacilli from koumiss in inner mongolia.
AB  == from 16 samples of traditional fermented koumiss collected in inner mongolia autonomous region of china, forty-eight lactobacilli strains were isolated and phenotypically characterized by their abilities to ferment different carbohydrates and by additional biochemical tests. the dominant lactobacilli species were identified as l. casei (17 strains), l. helveticus (10 strains) and  l. plantarum (8 strains), with a lower frequency of isolation for l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis (5 strains), l. paracasei (3 strains), l. kefiranofaciens (2  strains), l. curvatus (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and w. kandleri (1 strain). the ph values of all these samples were ranging from 3.37 to 3.94. in isolates, l. casei zhang, l. helveticus zl12-1, and l. plantarum bx6-6 were selected as potentially probiotic strains through the preliminary tests including resistance to low acid, abilities to grow in mrs with bile salts, antimicrobial activities and the viabilities during prolonged cold storage in fermented milk. moreover 16s rdna was conducted to confirm the identification.

TI  == aflatoxin b1 binding capacity of autochthonous strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == some foods are prone to contamination with aflatoxins, with detrimental effect on human health. lactic acid bacteria have been reported to bind aflatoxins and remove them from foods and feeds. reduction of aflatoxin b1 (afb1) from the liquid media by the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus fermentum) isolated from traditional iranian sourdough and dairy products is reported in the current study. the effect of incubation time on the binding capacity of the strains to afb1 was also investigated. duplicates of individual bacteria with population equivalent to 2 x 10(10) cfu/ml were incubated in the presence of afb1 at 37 degrees c for a period of 72 h, and the amounts of unbound afb1 were quantitated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. all the strains were capable of removal of afb1, and the reduction of afb1 ranged from 25 to 61% throughout the incubation period. removal of afb1 was a rapid process, with approximately 61 and 56% of the toxin taken instantly by l. fermentum and l. plantarum, respectively.  binding was of a reversible nature, and some of the bound afb1 was released into  the media by the repeated centrifugation and resuspension of the cell pellets. the stability of the bacteria-toxin complex was strain dependent, and l. casei was a stronger binder of afb1 compared with the other bacteria. no toxin release  was observed after 24 h. these findings tend to suggest that certain novel probiotic bacteria with high aflatoxin binding capacity could be selected for detoxification of foods.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  == some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. however, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. the ph fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. all strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in ph with sorbitol and two with xylitol. none of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. as all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for  oral health purposes can be made.

TI  == selection of probiotic lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented plant beverages.
AB  == screening for probiotic bacteria from non-human sources were performed in this study. three hundred and twenty-seven strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were  isolated from 90 samples of fermented plant beverages (fpbs) and pickles collected from around thailand. potentially useful probiotic properties were investigated in vitro in parallel with a commercial probiotic strain of lactobacillus casei, r obtained from a dairy probiotic product in thailand. an isolate ss2, selected from a fermented star fruit beverage, survived in the human biological barriers (0.15 and 0.30% bile salt, ph values between 3-8, presence or absence of oxygen), resistance to some antibiotics in general use and showed other benefits to the host (antibacterial activity, utilizations of protein and starch). the isolate ss2 had a higher specific growth rate and better inhibitory  properties against food borne pathogenic bacteria and spoilage organisms than the commercial probiotic r strain. it also grew well in mrs and the spy2 medium that  is free from animal-derived ingredients, (r>0.8). the isolate ss2 was therefore considered to be a potentially useful probiotic lab for a non dairy product such  as fpbs and was provisionally identified as a strain of lactobacillus plantarum.

TI  == adhesion of the probiotic strains enterococcus mundtii st4sa and lactobacillus plantarum 423 to caco-2 cells under conditions simulating the intestinal tract, and in the presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments.
AB  == adhesion of enterococcus mundtii st4sa and lactobacillus plantarum 423 to caco-2  (human carcinoma epithelial) cells was visualized by fluorescent staining. both strains showed good adhesion compared to l. casei mb1, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1 and l. rhamnosus gg. no correlation was found between hydrophobicity, aggregation and adhesion to caco-2 cells. presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments reduced adhesion of bacterial strains to caco-2 cells. proteins sensitive to pepsin, trypsin and pronase are involved in the adhesion of e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423 to caco-2 cells. adhesion of listeria monocytogenes scotta to caco-2 cells was not prevented by e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423. cell-free culture supernatants of strains st4sa and 423, containing the antimicrobial peptides plantaricin 423 and peptide st4sa, prevented the invasion of l. monocytogenes scotta into caco-2 cells.

TI  == early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  == following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. we hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and nec. caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (colos; n = 5), formula (form; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (form-p; bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus: l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum; n = 13). clinical nec scores were reduced (p < 0.05) in form-p (2.0 +/- 0.2) and colos groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with form pigs (3.4  +/- 0.6). lower nec scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, rna integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase  a and n activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the form-p and colos groups (p < 0.05). diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between form-p and form pigs. form-p pigs had  lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, clostridium perfringens, and  had commensal lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to form pigs. these results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of nec.

TI  == complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plca36 isolated from lactobacillus casei  zhang.
AB  == the complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from lactobacillus casei zhang  was determined. plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. for the first time, we identified a relbe toxin-antitoxin (ta) locus in a lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. a region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. the cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pwcfs103 and  pmrc01 from lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis, respectively. comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. in addition, two chromosome-encoded relbe systems in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri were identified.

TI  == the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. recent studies indicated that some lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. however, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. therefore, we examined the effects of lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (cl(-)/oh(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial  cells. postconfluent caco-2 cells were treated with the lactobacillus species lactobacillus acidophilus (la), lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, or  lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)cl uptake in base-loaded cells. treatment with live, but not heat-killed, la and lr significantly increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. similarly,  the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live la increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange. the ability of la or its conditioned culture medium to enhance cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was blocked by pi-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. corresponding to the increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity, la treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, slc26a3 [down regulated in adenoma (dra)]. the increased dra membrane localization might contribute to the increased cl(-) absorption by la. our results suggest that la secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.

TI  == administration of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum affects the diversity of murine intestinal lactobacilli, but not the overall bacterial community structure.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract (git) of many mammalian hosts. their administration as probiotics in functional foods is currently a frequent practice, mainly because of their benefits to host health. it is therefore of interest to study the impact of administration of exogenous strains of lactobacillus normally used as probiotics upon endogenous microbial populations. for this purpose, fecal and intestinal tissue samples were analyzed  in a mouse model fed with a mixture of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus  casei isolated from commercially available dairy products. the murine intestinal  microbiota was studied by means of cultivation-independent 16s rrna gene-targeted techniques, namely denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and sequence analysis of clone  libraries. multivariate statistical analysis was used to integrate datasets obtained from the different techniques applied. whereas no differences were detected in the composition of the overall fecal bacterial community, changes were observed for intestinal tissue samples. moreover, an increase in the diversity of gut lactobacilli was observed in fecal as well as intestinal tissue  samples when mice received the mixture of l. casei and l. plantarum.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the  agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph  range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == microbial dynamics of castelmagno pdo, a traditional italian cheese, with a focus on lactic acid bacteria ecology.
AB  == the dynamics of dominant microflora throughout the manufacture and ripening processes were evaluated in three batches of traditional castelmagno pdo cheese.  milk, curd and cheese samples, at different stages during cheesemaking, were collected and subjected to culture-dependent and -independent analysis. traditional plating and genetic identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates, and pcr-dgge analysis of v1 region of 16s rrna gene were carried out. the collected samples were also monitored by hplc for the presence of organic acids, sugars and ketones. lab resulted to be the prevailing microflora in all production stages although enterococci, coagulase-negative cocci and yeasts also  showed considerable viable counts probably related to the presence, in the dairy  samples analysed, of free short-chain fatty acids detected by hplc. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the species most frequently isolated during castelmagno  pdo manufacture, while lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus paracasei were isolated with the highest frequencies from ripened castelmagno pdo cheese samples. occasionally strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens and lactobacillus casei were isolated. the results obtained on castelmagno pdo microflora underlines a partial correspondence between culture-dependent method and dgge analysis. thus, in this  study, it is highlighted once more the importance to combine molecular culture-independent approaches with classical microbiological methods for the study of complex environmental communities occurring in food matrices.

AB  == fiore sardo protected denomination of origin is a traditional sardinian (italy) hard cheese produced exclusively from whole raw ovine milk and coagulated with lamb rennet paste. currently, fiore sardo is still produced by shepherds at the farmhouse level without the addition of any starter culture and the cheese-making process is characterized by significant waste. the first objective of the present work was to investigate the autochthonous microflora present in milk and fiore sardo cheese in order to select lactic acid bacterial (lab) cultures with suitable cheese-making attributes and, possibly reduce the production waste. secondly, the ability of selected cultures to guarantee cheese healthiness and quality was tested in experimental cheese-making trials. in this study, we show that the typical lactic microflora of raw ewe's milk and fiore sardo cheese is mostly composed of mesophilic lab such as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei subsp. casei. moreover, strains belonging to the species were selected for cheese-making attributes and used in experimental cheese-making trials carried out in different farms producing fiore  sardo. the evolution of the cheese microflora, free amino acids and free fatty acids during the ripening showed that the experimental cheeses were characterized by a balanced ratio of the chemical constituents, by a reduced number of spoilage microorganisms and, remarkably, by the absence of production waste that were significant for the control cheeses.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objectives: proton pump inhibitors (ppi) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. there is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as lactobacillus. the hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains are effected by ppis. methods: nineteen different strains of lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at ph of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 microg/ml. bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to  pantoprazole. results: in the unexposed (control) group, nine lactobacilli strains were affected by ph changes from 6.5 to 4.5. in the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 lactobacilli strains were found to have an mic below 625 microg/ml, with l. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (mic = 20 microg/ml). in some strains, such as l. s. salivarius 11741, gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. conclusion: growth rates and morphology of oral lactobacillus are affected by the ph of the environment. pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. significance: the  balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of ppi pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.

AB  == here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the c terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (ca domain) of acma (a major autolysin from lactococcus lactis). western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (ca-amya) of the ca domain and alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 (amya) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of l. lactis cells. amya was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. moreover, with an increase in the number of ca domains, the quantity of ca-amya fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. when three repeats of the ca domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. the raw starch-degrading activity of amya was significantly higher when amya was fused to the c terminus of the ca domain than when it was fused to the n terminus. in addition, ca-amya fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei.

TI  == fermentation of calcium-fortified soymilk with lactobacillus: effects on calcium  solubility, isoflavone conversion, and production of organic acids.
AB  == the objective of this study was to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of lactobacillus, namely, l. acidophilus atcc 4962, atcc33200, atcc 4356, atcc 4461, l. casei ascc  290, l. plantarum ascc 276, and l. fermentum vri-003. the parameters that were used are viability, ph, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c, then stored for 14 d at 4 degrees c. soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (aa). organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using hplc. viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8.5 log(10) cfu/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14-d  storage at 4 degrees c. after 24 h, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in soluble calcium. l. acidophilus atcc 4962 and l. casei ascc 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89.3% and 87.0% soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. the increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered  ph associated with production of lactic and acetic acids. fermentation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. our  results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment.

TI  == lactobacillus strain diversity based on partial hsp60 gene sequences and design of pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays for species identification and differentiation.
AB  == a phylogenetic tree showing diversities among 116 partial (499-bp) lactobacillus  hsp60 (groel, encoding a 60-kda heat shock protein) nucleotide sequences was obtained and compared to those previously described for 16s rrna and tuf gene sequences. the topology of the tree produced in this study showed a lactobacillus species distribution similar, but not identical, to those previously reported. however, according to the most recent systematic studies, a clear differentiation of 43 single-species clusters was detected/identified among the sequences analyzed. the slightly higher variability of the hsp60 nucleotide sequences than  of the 16s rrna sequences offers better opportunities to design or develop molecular assays allowing identification and differentiation of either distant or very closely related lactobacillus species. therefore, our results suggest that hsp60 can be considered an excellent molecular marker for inferring the taxonomy  and phylogeny of members of the genus lactobacillus and that the chosen primers can be used in a simple pcr procedure allowing the direct sequencing of the hsp60 fragments. moreover, in this study we performed a computer-aided restriction endonuclease analysis of all 499-bp hsp60 partial sequences and we showed that the pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns obtainable by using both endonucleases alui and taci (in separate reactions) can allow identification and differentiation of all 43 lactobacillus species considered, with the exception of the pair l. plantarum/l. pentosus. however, the latter species can be differentiated by further analysis with sau3ai or msei. the hsp60  pcr-rflp approach was efficiently applied to identify and to differentiate a total of 110 wild lactobacillus strains (including closely related species, such  as l. casei and l. rhamnosus or l. plantarum and l. pentosus) isolated from cheese and dry-fermented sausages.

AB  == four semi-hard italian goats' milk cheeses, flor di capra (fc), caprino di cavalese (cc), caprino di valsassina (cv) and capritilla (c), were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, volatile profile and sensory characteristics. mean values for the gross composition in part differed between cheeses. at the end of ripening, cheeses contained 7.98-8.51 log10 cfu/g of non-starter lactic acid bacteria. lactobacillus paracasei, lb. casei and lb. plantarum were dominant in almost all cheeses. as shown by the principal component analysis of rp-fplc data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free amino acids, secondary proteolysis of cc and cv mainly differed from the other two cheeses. a total of 72 volatile components were identified by steam distillation-extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. free fatty acids and esters qualitatively and quantitatively differentiated the profile of cv and cc, respectively. the lowest concentrations  of volatile components characterized fc. descriptive sensory analysis using 17 flavour attributes was carried out by a trained panel. different flavour attributes distinguished the four goats' cheeses and relationships were found with volatile components, biochemical characteristics and technology.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

TI  == the lactobacillus plantarum strain aca-dc287 isolated from a greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly  by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those  present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.

TI  == anti-inflammatory effects of lactobacillus casei bl23 producing or not a manganese-dependant catalase on dss-induced colitis in mice.
AB  == background: human immune cells generate large amounts of reactive oxygen species  (ros) throughout the respiratory burst that occurs during inflammation. in inflammatory bowel diseases, a sustained and abnormal activation of the immune system results in oxidative stress in the digestive tract and in a loss of intestinal homeostasis. we previously showed that the heterologous production of  the lactobacillus plantarum atcc14431 manganese-dependant catalase (mnkat) in lb. casei bl23 successfully enhances its survival when exposed to oxidative stress. in this study, we evaluated the preventive effects of this antioxidative lb. casei strain in a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced moderate colitis. results: either lb. casei bl23 mnkat- or mnkat+ was administered daily to mice treated with dss for 10 days. in contrast to control mice treated with pbs for which dss induced bleeding diarrhea and mucosal lesions, mice treated with both lb. casei strains presented a significant (p < 0.05) reduction of caecal and colonic inflammatory scores. conclusion: no contribution of mnkat to the protective effect from epithelial damage has been observed in the tested conditions. in contrast, these results confirm the high interest of lb. casei as  an anti-inflammatory probiotic strain.

TI  == preliminary characterization of wild lactic acid bacteria and their abilities to  produce flavour compounds in ripened model cheese system.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to preliminary characterize wild lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously isolated during artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheese-making for technological and flavour formation abilities in a model cheese system. methods and results: twelve lab were studied for the ability to grow at 10 and 45 degrees c, to coagulate and acidify both reconstituted skim milk and ewe's milk. moreover, the capacity of the strains to generate aroma compounds was evaluated in a model cheese system at 30- and 60-day ripening. flavour compounds  were screened by sensory analysis and throughout gas chromatography (gc)-mass spectrometry (ms). most of the strains were able to grow both at 10 and 45 degrees c and exhibited high ability to acidify and coagulate ewes' milk. sensory evaluation revealed that the wild strains produced more significant flavour attributes than commercial strains in the 60-day-old model cheese system. gc-ms data confirmed the results of sensory evaluations and showed the ability of wild  lactobacilli to generate key volatile compounds. particularly, three wild lactobacilli strains, belonging to lactobacillus casei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum species, generated both in 60- and 30-day-old model cheeses system, the 3-methyl butan(al)(ol) compound, which is associated with fruity taste. conclusions: the present work preliminarily demonstrated that the technological and flavour formation abilities of the wild strains are strain-specific and that  wild lactobacilli, which produced key flavour compounds during ripening, could be used as tailor-made starters. significance and impact of the study: this study reports the technological characterization and flavour formation ability of wild  lab strains isolated from artisanal pecorino cheese and highlights that the catabolic activities were highly strain dependent. hence, wild lactobacilli could be selected as tailor-made starter cultures for the ps cheese manufacture.

TI  == evidence for in vitro anti-genotoxicity of cheese non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  == the inhibition of direct acting dna reactive agents by 63 non-starter lactobacilli isolated from raw ewes milk cheeses was examined by short-term assay (sos-chromotest) and compared with already characterized starter lactobacilli. the screening revealed strains active against the nitroarene 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (nqo) and the alkylating agent n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in different species of the genus lactobacillus (l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, lactobacillus spp.). it was proved that the anti-genotoxicity was strain-dependent, and always  associated with spectroscopic modification of genotoxins. the frequency of strains inhibiting nitroarene genotoxicity was comparable for non-starter and starter lactobacilli, whereas inhibition of the alkylating agent was largely predominant in non-starter isolates. seventeen strains presented inhibitory activity against both genotoxins. dna rapd-pcr performed with m13, pro-up and rpo2 primers on the lactobacilli under examination showed genetic diversity in these strains. the non-starter isolates clustered in seven groups and the strains presenting a high degree of activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide clustered in a single group with a similarity around 75%. interestingly, the strains with anti-genotoxic properties also showed acid-bile tolerance, indicating that the autochthonous lactobacilli which survive cheese ripening may also reach the gut as viable cells and could prevent genotoxin dna damage to enterocytes, as is desirable for probiotic bacteria.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

AB  == plantaricin 423 is a class iia bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum isolated from sorghum beer. it has been previously determined that plantaricin 423 is encoded by a plasmid designated ppla4, which is now completely sequenced.  the plantaricin 423 operon shares high sequence similarity with the operons of coagulin, pediocin pa-1, and pediocin ach, with small differences in the dna sequence encoding the mature bacteriocin peptide and the immunity protein. apart  from the bacteriocin operon, no significant sequence similarity could be detected between the dna or translated sequence of ppla4 and the available dna or translated sequences of the plasmids encoding pediocin ach, pediocin pa-1, and coagulin, possibly indicating a different origin. in addition to the bacteriocin  operon, sequence analysis of ppla4 revealed the presence of two open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encodes a putative mobilization (mob) protein that is homologous to the pmv158 superfamily of mobilization proteins. highest sequence similarity occurred between this protein and the mob protein of l. plantarum ncdo 1088. orf2 encodes a putative replication protein that revealed low sequence similarity to replication proteins of plasmids plme300 from lactobacillus fermentum and pyit356 from lactobacillus casei. the immunity protein of plantaricin 423 contains 109 amino acids. although plantaricin 423 shares high sequence similarity with the pediocin pa-1 operon, no cross-reactivity was recorded between the immunity proteins of plantaricin 423 and pediocin pa-1.

TI  == inhibition of listeria innocua growth by antimicrobial-producing lactic acid cultures in vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon.
AB  == the biopreservative potential of three antimicrobial-producing lactic acid bacteria strains was evaluated on cold-smoked salmon. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and carnobacterium piscicola were added singly or in association to cold-smoked salmon, artificially contaminated with listeria innocua and stored under vacuum for 30 days at 4 degrees c. all the lactic cultures were able to inhibit listeria innocua growth, showing a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect, without affecting negatively the sensory quality of the product. lactobacillus casei was bacteriostatic when inoculated at 6 log cfu/g, but bactericidal at 8 log cfu/g, reducing listeria innocua of 3.3 log cfu/g in comparison with the test at the end of storage. lactobacillus plantarum and c. piscicola strains, inoculated singly at 6 log cfu/g reduced listeria innocua counts of 2.8 and 2.7 log cfu/g, respectively, compared with the test. the association lactobacillus casei-lactobacillus plantarum was the most effective among the treatments with 6 log cfu/g inoculum, as listeria innocua counts decreased of 3.2 log cfu/g compared with the test. the treatment with lactobacillus casei-c. piscicola association was less effective than c. piscicola alone.

TI  == vsl#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == production of a heterologous nonheme catalase by lactobacillus casei: an efficient tool for removal of h2o2 and protection of lactobacillus bulgaricus from oxidative stress in milk.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally sensitive to h2o2, a compound that they  can paradoxically produce themselves, as is the case for lactobacillus bulgaricus. lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14431 is one of the very few lab strains able to degrade h2o2 through the action of a nonheme, manganese-dependent catalase (hereafter called mnkat). the mnkat gene was expressed in three catalase-deficient lab species: l. bulgaricus atcc 11842, lactobacillus casei bl23, and lactococcus lactis mg1363. while the protein could be detected in all heterologous hosts, enzyme activity was observed only in l. casei. this is probably due to the differences in the mn contents of the cells, which are reportedly similar in l. plantarum and l. casei but at least 10- and 100-fold lower in lactococcus lactis and l. bulgaricus, respectively. the expression of the mnkat gene in l. casei conferred enhanced oxidative stress resistance, as measured by an increase in the survival rate after exposure to h2o2, and improved long-term survival in aerated cultures. in mixtures of l. casei producing mnkat and l. bulgaricus, l. casei can eliminate h2o2 from the culture medium, thereby protecting both l. casei and l. bulgaricus from its deleterious effects.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == influence of phenol, p-cresol and indole on growth and survival of intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == some intestinal bacteria can produce many genotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic substances. the major products of the bacterial aromatic amino acids fermentation-phenolic and indolic compounds which are responsible for colon cancer development are accumulated in the colon. the effect of phenol, p-cresol and indole (2, 20 and 100 microg/ml doses) on growth and survival of four strains of intestinal lactic acid bacteria was studied. growth of bacteria was not affected by any of the concentrations of phenol and p-cresol tested. the growth of 2 strains was slightly inhibited by 100 microg/ml of indole. there was no influence of phenol and p-cresol on survival of lactic bacteria until 120 h and specific reaction to carcinogens depending on strain was observed after that incubation time. indole concentrations 20 and 100 microg/ml appeared to be toxic  for all tested strains but just after 24, 48 or 72 h of incubation depending on the strain. in total, 2 microg/ml of indole had a very little effect.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen a.
AB  == mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. the induction of protective iga in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. in this work, streptococcus pneumoniae psaa antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus helveticus. after nasal inoculation of c57bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (igg in serum) and mucosal (iga in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-psaa antibodies was determined. immunization with l. lactis mg1363 induced very low levels of iga and igg, possibly by the low amount of psaa expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. all three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of psaa protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) cfu). however, l. plantarum ncdo1193 and l. helveticus atcc15009 elicited the highest antibody response (iga and igg). vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant l. lactis led  to a decrease in s. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. our results confirm that certain lactobacillus strains have intrinsic  properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

AB  == research was undertaken to determine the suitability of cabbage as a raw material for production of probiotic cabbage juice by lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus  plantarum c3, lactobacillus casei a4, and lactobacillus delbrueckii d7). cabbage  juice was inoculated with a 24-h-old lactic culture and incubated at 30 degrees c. changes in ph, acidity, sugar content, and viable cell counts during fermentation under controlled conditions were monitored. l. casei, l. delbrueckii, and l. plantarum grew well on cabbage juice and reached nearly 10x10(8) cfu/ml after 48 h of fermentation at 30 degrees c. l. casei, however, produced a smaller amount of titratable acidity expressed as lactic acid than l.  delbrueckii or l. plantarum. after 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees c, the viable cell counts of l. plantarum and l. delbrueckii were still 4.1x10(7) and 4.5x10(5) ml(-1), respectively. l. casei did not survive the low ph and high acidity conditions in fermented cabbage juice and lost cell viability completely  after 2 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees c. fermented cabbage juice could serve as a healthy beverage for vegetarians and lactose-allergic consumers.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, structural organization and host range of prs4, a small cryptic pediococcus pentosaceus plasmid that contains two cassettes commonly found in other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the cryptic plasmid prs4 (3550 bp) from pediococcus pentosaceus rs4 was determined. sequence analysis revealed the presence of three open reading frames (orfs). the putative protein coded by orf 1 showed 93% identity with the mobilization protein of lactobacillus casei plasmid  plc88 and 94% identity with a sequenced fragment of the mobilization protein of p. damnosus plasmid pf8801, suggesting a common origin for these three mobilization proteins. the putative protein coded by orf 2 showed 92% identity with the replication protein of l. plantarum plasmid pwcfs101, a plasmid that replicates via the rolling circle (rc) mechanism, suggesting a similar replication mechanism for prs4. supporting this hypothesis, a putative double strand origin (dso) and a region with palindromic sequences that could function as single strand origin (sso), were detected in prs4. a function could not be assigned to orf 3. since orf 1 exhibits high identity with l. casei plasmid plc88 but lower identity (58%) with other lactobacillus plasmids, and orf 2 exhibits high identity with the l. plantarum plasmid pwcfs101 but lower identity (55-58%)  with other lactobacillus plasmids (including plc88), two independent cassettes, from different sources, seem to be involved in the structure of prs4. plasmids derived from prs4 containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene were successfully electrotransformed in l. plantarum, l. casei, p. pentosaceus, and pediococcus acidilactici, suggesting that prs4 could be used as a cloning vector  for lactic acid bacteria. to our knowledge prs4 is the first rc-replicating plasmid of p. pentosaceus that has been completely sequenced and used as cloning  vector.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == characterisation of lab in typical salento pecorino cheese.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the typical pecorino cheese of the salento area of italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. a preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. for the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16s rdna gene was employed in addition, restriction analysis of amplified rdna (ardra) and pcr and  aflp fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated upgma cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. the data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. the main identified strains were lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. sakei, l. pentosus, l. farciminis and leuconostoc mesenteroides.

TI  == selective probiotic bacteria induce il-10-producing regulatory t cells in vitro by modulating dendritic cell function through dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin.
AB  == background: lactobacilli are probiotic bacteria that are frequently tested in the management of allergic diseases or gastroenteritis. it is hypothesized that these probiotics have immunoregulatory properties and promote mucosal tolerance, which  is in part mediated by regulatory t cells (treg cells). on the basis of pathogenic or tissue-specific priming, dendritic cells (dc) acquire different t cell-instructive signals and drive the differentiation of naive t h cells into either t h 1, t h 2, or regulatory effector t cells. objective: we studied in what way different species of lactobacilli prime human dcs for their ability to drive treg cells. methods: human monocyte-derived dcs were cultured in vitro with lactobacilli of different species. results: two different species of lactobacilli, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei , but not lactobacillus plantarum, prime monocyte-derived dcs to drive the development of treg cells. these treg cells produced increased levels of il-10 and were capable  of inhibiting the proliferation of bystander t cells in an il-10-dependent fashion. strikingly, both l reuteri and l casei , but not l plantarum , bind the  c-type lectin dc-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (dc-sign). blocking antibodies to dc-sign inhibited the induction of the treg cells by these probiotic bacteria, stressing that ligation of dc-sign can actively prime dcs to induce treg cells. conclusions: the targeting of dc-sign by certain probiotic bacteria might explain their beneficial effect in the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis and crohn's disease.

AB  == in this study, pediococci selective medium (psm) was evaluated for the enumeration of pediococcus acidilactici and pediococcus pentosaceus from probiotic animal feed and silage inoculants. psm is based on the complex basal medium mrs supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride, novobiocin, vancomycin, and  nystatin. no significant change in electivity was observed when pediococci where  recovered from culture or powder-based products following incubation at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 24 h. the medium was suitable for the enumeration of pediococci in samples also containing bacilli, bifidobacteria, enterococci, lactobacilli, lactococci, propionibacteria, streptococci, and yeast  components. however, to inhibit lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei,  ampicillin was added and the revised medium, termed psm+a, was also considered to be suitably elective for pediococci recovered from powder. in addition, a rapid pfge protocol is presented, which allows pediococcus species and strain verification from colonies in less than 3 days.

TI  == screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  == antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  the ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. the study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (sos-chromotest for genotoxicity in escherichia coli and ames test for mutagenicity in salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (comet assay for genotoxicity in caco-2 enterocytes). a high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus plantarum. inhibition of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one l. acidophilus strain. all the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. concordance of the results obtained with  microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == [probiotics as therapeutic agents in irritable bowel syndrome].
AB  == probiotics are defined as living micro-organisms which, when administered in large amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. the use of probiotics in the  therapy of infectious bowel diseases as well as maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis and in pouchitis is evidence-based. also, in several studies proof could be supplied that specific probiotics relieve the symptoms and the course of irritable bowel syndrome. some trials showed a significant improvement  of irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation via lactobacillus casei shirota  and e. coli nissle 1917. lactobacillus plantarum has been proven effective in reducing pain and abdominal bloating. however, in most of the studies rather small numbers of patients were examined. furthermore, these studies do not always closely follow scientific standards (randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled). therefore, confirmatory studies are necessary to examine the effect of probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.

TI  == biodiversity of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains isolated from five sourdoughs.
AB  == aims: five different sourdoughs were investigated for the composition of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the biodiversity of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains. methods and results: a total of 57 strains were isolated from five sourdoughs. isolated strains were all identified by the 16s rdna sequence and species-specific primers for l. sanfranciscensis. results of identification showed that lab strains were l. sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus casei, weisella confusa and pediococcus pentosaceus. a total of 21  strains were identified as l. sanfranciscensis and these isolates were detected in all five sourdoughs. ribotyping was applied to investigate the relationship between intraspecies diversity of l. sanfranciscensis and sourdough. a total of 22 strains of l. sanfranciscensis including l. sanfranciscensis jcm 5668t were compared by ribotyping. the dendrogram of 21 ribotyping patterns showed four clusters, and l. sanfranciscensis jcm 5668t was independent of the others. the different biotypes of l. sanfranciscensis were present in two sourdoughs compared with other three sourdoughs. conclusions: the lab compositions of five sourdoughs were different and the relationship between intraspecies diversity of l. sanfranciscensis strains and five sourdoughs was shown by ribotyping. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that ribotyping was useful for distinguishing l. sanfranciscensis strains. a further important result is that the intra-species diversity of l. sanfranciscensis strains seems to be related to the sourdough preparation.

TI  == in vitro screening of potential probiotic activities of selected lactobacilli isolated from unpasteurized milk products for incorporation into soft cheese.
AB  == the aim was to select potentially probiotic lactobacilli from 88 strains isolated from unpasteurized milk and cheese products, and to incorporate these bacteria in a viable state into a soft cheese, without changing its quality. the survival of  these bacteria was assessed in acidic and bile conditions, after freezing at -80  degrees c. four strains from unpasteurized camembert--two lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lb. paracasei/casei strains--were identified and typed by pcr and pfge and were found to display potentially probiotic characteristics in addition  to resistance to low ph and bile. these characteristics were resistance to lysozyme, adhesion to caco-2 cells, antimicrobial effects against common foodborne pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, innocuity following the ingestion of high doses by mice and appropriate antibiotic susceptibility profiles. the potential of lb. plantarum strain ucma 3037 for incorporation into a soft cheese (pont-l'eveque registered designation of origin (rdo)) was investigated. this strain grew well and survived in sufficient numbers (more than 10(7) cfu/g throughout the shelf-life of the product) in the cheese. this strain did not change the quality  score of the product until the best before date (75 days after manufacture). thus, unpasteurized camembert is a natural source of potentially probiotic lactobacilli, which could be used as an additive in the development of potentially probiotic soft cheeses. further work is required to demonstrate the persistence and efficacy of these strains in the human host upon ingestion.

AB  == telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards procedures. plates with daptomycin were supplemented with ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. the mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium ramosum (n =  16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; peptostreptococcus spp. (n  = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and corynebacterium spp. (n = 31),  0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of td-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except c. clostridioforme and lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more  active. daptomycin had decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains  of actinomyces spp. and all c. ramosum, eubacterium lentum, and lactobacillus plantarum strains. linezolid showed decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against c. ramosum, two strains of c. difficile, and 15 strains of lactobacillus  spp. imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. the mics of ampicillin for eight clostridium spp. and three strains of l. casei were >1 microg/ml. the mic(90) of td-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. td-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.

TI  == a pcr assay for detection of acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria in acidic  food products.
AB  == a pcr assay for the detection of acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria in the genera of lactobacillus and pediococcus was developed in this study. primers targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene were newly designed and used in this pcr assay. to determine the specificity of the assay, 56 different bacterial strains  (of 33 genera), 2 fungi, 3 animals, and 4 plants were tested. results were positive for most tested bacterial members of 16s rrna gene-based phylogenetic groups (classified in the lactobacillus casei and pediococcus group), including lactobacillus fructivorans, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus paracasei. for all other bacterial strains and eukaryote tested, results were negative. bacterial dna for pcr was prepared with a simple procedure with the use of chelex 100 resin from culture after growth in deman rogosa sharpe broth (ph 6.0). to test this pcr assay for the monitoring of the acetic acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria, l. fructivorans  was inoculated into several acidic food as an indicator. before the pcr, the inoculation of 10 to 50 cfu of bacteria per g of food was followed by a 28-h enrichment culture step, and the pcr assay allowed the detection of bacterial cells. including the enrichment culture step, the entire pcr detection process can be completed within 30 h.

TI  == use of folic acid casei medium reveals trimethoprim susceptibility of lactobacillus species.
AB  == aim: lactobacilli have been reported to have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. the susceptibility of lactobacilli to trimethoprim on different media was investigated in order to search for a phenotypic test method that could indicate the presence of acquired resistance genes. methods and results: strains  of lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum were susceptibility tested with e-tests on folic acid casei medium (facm), mrs and defined medium 1. the effects of addition or removal of nucleosides and thymidine phosphorylase were investigated. e-tests on facm yielded reproducible minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for trimethoprim but addition of nucleosides was necessary for growth of lact. acidophilus. mics for the tested strains were 0.125-0.19, 0.25-3 and 0.064-0.19 microg ml(-1) for lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum, respectively. with the addition of deoxyuridine and deoxyadenosine to facm the mics of lact. acidophilus were 0.064-1 microg ml(-1). conclusions, significance and impact of the study: lactobacilli do not have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. the results show that trimethoprim susceptibility testing of the tested lactobacillus species is possible and indicate that transferable resistance genes are absent in all the tested strains.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus casei, dominant species in naturally fermented sicilian green olives.
AB  == this study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria in naturally fermented green olives, collected from different areas of sicily. both classical biochemical tests and pcr/restriction fragments length  polymorphism (rflp) of 16s rdna were used to characterize the isolates. the identity of the isolates was obtained by the partial sequencing analysis of the 16s rdna. the biomerieux software assigned the 13 heterofermentative strains to the lactobacillus brevis species; 24 homofermentative strains were classified as  lactobacillus casei and the remaining 11 homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus plantarum. the rapid id 32 strep test identified coccal-shaped strains as enterococcus faecium species. the pcr/rflp analysis showed a remarkable bacterial heterogeneity within the isolates. the 16s rdna partial sequencing did not confirm biochemical identification, revealing a strong dominance of isolates belonging to the l. casei species. it is noteworthy that this species has never been reported as dominant species in fermented vegetables.a combination of molecular and biochemical analysis allowed the identification of species involved in natural food fermentations.

TI  == antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB  == microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain,  alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double  layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.

TI  == the effects of using lactic acid bacteria inoculants in maize silage on the formation of biogenic amines.
AB  == silages from five ripened varieties of silage maize with dry matter contents ranging between 275 and 410 g/kg were prepared in five laboratory experiments. whole-plant maize was fermented at 22 degrees c and silages were then stored at the same temperature for 4 months. spontaneously fermented silages were prepared  as control variants and compared with silages inoculated with commercial strains  of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobzcillus buchneri and a mixed preparation microsil containing l. plantarum, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus. the starter cultures were applied at doses 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6) cfu/g of chopped maize. seven biogenic amines and polyamines were extracted from silages with perchloric acid and determined as n-benzamides by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. common chemical criteria of silage quality were also determined. all three inoculants, mainly at the higher dose, decreased significantly contents of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine, three undesirable amines occurring at the highest levels. l. plantarum was the most effective. contents of histamine and tryptamine were low in all experimental silages. also relatively low were levels of polyamines spermidine and mainly of spermine.

TI  == role of peptidoglycan subtypes in the pathogenesis of bacterial cell wall arthritis.
AB  == background: bacterial cell wall (cw) arthritis develops in susceptible strains of rats after a single intraperitoneal injection of the cw from certain bacterial species, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic. for the development of chronic bacterial cw arthritis, the structure of the bacterial peptidoglycan (pg) has been found to be decisive. objective: to define the role of pg subtypes in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial cw arthritis. method: arthritis was induced with cws of lactobacillus plantarum, l casei b, l casei c, and l fermentum. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the presence of cw derived muramic acid in the liver and to determine pg subtypes. cws were also tested for  their resistance to lysozyme in vitro. results: these results and those published previously indicate that pgs of cws which induce chronic arthritis, no matter whether they were derived from strains of streptococcus, bifidobacterium, collinsella, or lactobacillus, all have lysine as the third amino acid of the pg  stem peptide, representing pg subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha. those strains which induce only transient acute arthritis or no arthritis at all do not have lysine in this position, resulting in different pg subtypes. conclusions: in vivo degradation of only those pgs with the subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha leads to the  occurrence of large cw fragments, which persist in tissue and have good proinflammatory ability. cws with other pg subtypes, even if they are lysozyme resistant, do not cause chronic arthritis, because the released fragments are not phlogistic. it is emphasised that a variety of microbial components not causing inflammation have been found in animal and human synovial tissue.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == characterization of a theta-type plasmid from lactobacillus sakei: a potential basis for low-copy-number vectors in lactobacilli.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the 13-kb plasmid prv500, isolated from lactobacillus sakei rv332, was determined. sequence analysis enabled the identification of genes coding for a putative type i restriction-modification system, two genes coding for putative recombinases of the integrase family, and a region likely involved in replication. the structural features of this region, comprising a putative ori segment containing 11- and 22-bp repeats and a repa gene coding for a putative initiator protein, indicated that prv500 belongs to the pucl287 subfamily of theta-type replicons. a 3.7-kb fragment encompassing this region was fused to an escherichia coli replicon to produce the shuttle vector prv566 and was observed to be functional in l. sakei for plasmid replication. the l. sakei replicon alone could not support replication in e. coli. plasmid prv500 and its derivative prv566 were determined to be at very low  copy numbers in l. sakei. prv566 was maintained at a reasonable rate over 20 generations in several lactobacilli, such as lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus plantarum, in addition to l. sakei, making it an interesting basis for developing vectors. sequence relationships with other plasmids are described and discussed.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  == there are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. in this study, lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri,  l. casei and l. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic  escherichia coli (ehec) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, c2bbe1.  while the adhesion and colonization of ehec was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of ehec into the cell line was  markedly suppressed by l. rhamnosus, though not by others. concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of ehec and host cell were not affected by the presence of l. rhamnosus. simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on ehec internalization was strictly dependent on viable l. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed l. rhamnosus. the fact that l. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between l. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of ehec.

TI  == mode of action of lactocin 705, a two-component bacteriocin from lactobacillus casei crl705.
AB  == lactocin 705 is a bacteriocin whose activity depends on the complementary action  of two peptides (705alpha and 705beta) of 33-amino-acid residues each and is produced by lactobacillus casei crl705. biologically active, synthetic lactocin 705 was used to study the mode of action on sensitive cells of lactobacillus plantarum crl691. the addition of 90 nmol l(-1) of lactocin 705 to cells of l. plantarum dissipated both, the membrane potential (deltapsi) and the ph gradient  (deltaph). energized membrane, obtained after the addition of glucose, were more  susceptible to lactocin 705 action leading to the immediate release of intracellular k(+) and inorganic phosphate. when the role of various ions on sensitive cells were analyzed, only ca(2+) ion exhibited a protective effect against lactocin 705. these data suggest that the presence of a proton motive force (pmf) promotes the interaction of the bacteriocin with the cytoplasmic membrane of energized cells, leading to pore formation which allows for the efflux of ions, thereby ensuring efficient killing of target bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == probiotics and the urologist.
AB  == emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. the proper definition of probiotics is important "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health  benefit on the host", for several reasons. it rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. guidelines, prepared by the united nations and world health organization are now  available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. in urology, the most studied strains are lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum b-54 and rc-14. their use daily in oral form, or  once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. organisms such as oxalobacter formigenes, still in the r&d phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. some studies using l. casei shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using l. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. in short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.

TI  == extent of genetic lesions of the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways in lactobacillus plantarum, l. paraplantarum, l. pentosus, and l. casei: prevalence  of co(2)-dependent auxotrophs and characterization of deficient arg genes in l. plantarum.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria require rich media since, due to mutations in their biosynthetic genes, they are unable to synthesize numerous amino acids and nucleobases. arginine biosynthesis and pyrimidine biosynthesis have a common intermediate, carbamoyl phosphate (cp), whose synthesis requires co(2). we investigated the extent of genetic lesions in both the arginine biosynthesis and  pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways in a collection of lactobacilli, including 150 strains of lactobacillus plantarum, 32 strains of l. pentosus, 15 strains of l. paraplantarum, and 10 strains of l. casei. the distribution of prototroph and auxotroph phenotypes varied between species. all l. casei strains, no l. paraplantarum strains, two l. pentosus strains, and seven l. plantarum strains required arginine for growth. arginine auxotrophs were more frequently found in l. plantarum isolated from milk products than in l. plantarum isolated from fermented plant products or humans; association with dairy products might favor arginine auxotrophy. in l. plantarum the argcjbdf genes were functional in most strains, and when they were inactive, only one gene was mutated in more than one-half of the arginine auxotrophs. random mutation may have generated these auxotrophs since different arg genes were inactivated (there were single point mutations in three auxotrophs and nonrevertible genetic lesions in four auxotrophs). these data support the hypothesis that lactic acid bacteria evolve by progressively loosing unnecessary genes upon adaptation to specific habitats,  with genome evolution towards cumulative dna degeneration. although auxotrophy for only uracil was found in one l. pentosus strain, a high co(2) requirement (hcr) for arginine and pyrimidine was common; it was found in 74 of 207 lactobacillus strains tested. these hcr auxotrophs may have had their cp cellular pool-related genes altered or deregulated.

TI  == lectin-like binding of lactobacilli considered for their use in probiotical preparations for animal use.
AB  == three gut lactobacilli from piglets (lactobacillus plantarum l 5, lactobacillus paracasei l 81, lactobacillus fermentum l 670) and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c.) from a calf were examined by microtitre plate binding assay for their lectin-like binding activity after their cultivation on rogosa agar and in mrs broth. three ecm (extracellular matrix) molecules (fetuin, porcine fibronectin and porcine mucin) were selected for this assay. additionally, the effect of heparin on the binding of these three ecm molecules by lactobacillus strains in microtitre plates was tested. moreover, haemagglutination tests with pig, cattle, sheep, and hen erythrocytes were performed. however, none of the four lactobacillus strains examined did react with any of the erythrocytes tested. the differences between individual strains were observed in their binding to immobilised ecm molecules. the best adherent was the lactobacillus plantarum l5, however, the other three strains showed also good ecm binding. with regard to an influence of cultivation medium on lectin-like binding activity, binding of all ecm molecules was expressed in lactobacillus paracasei l 81 to significantly  higher degree (p < 0.001) after cultivation on rogosa agar than in mrs broth. similarly, strains lactobacillus fermentum l 670 and lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c. displayed significantly higher (p < 0.001) binding of fibronectin and mucin after growth on rogosa agar in comparison with mrs broth cultivation. however, no significant (on fetuin and fibronectin binding) or opposite effect (on mucin binding) of cultivation medium was observed in lactobacillus plantarum l 5 strain. the influence of cultivation medium on fetuin binding by lactobacillus fermentum l 670 was also not significant while lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum l.c. bound fetuin significantly better (p < 0.01) after growth on rogosa agar. heparin pretreatment increased the binding of the ecm molecules by the lactobacillus fermentum l 670 strain significantly (p < 0.001 or p < 0.05) with the exception of porcine fibronectin when the strain was cultivated in mrs broth. this result is important especially  in the connection with the previous observations that heparin decreased ecm binding of enteropathogens as staphylococci or clinical enterococcal isolates. following up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results indicate that  the selected lactobacilli are probably suitable for probiotic purposes.

TI  == differential roles of the two-component peptides of lactocin 705 in antimicrobial activity.
AB  == lactobacillus casei crl705 produces a class iib bacteriocin, lactocin 705, which  relies on the complementary action of two components, lac705alpha and lac705beta. these peptides exert a bactericidal effect on the indicator strain lactobacillus  plantarum crl691, with an optimal lac705alpha/lac705beta peptide ratio of 1 to 4. electron microscopy studies showed that treated crl691 cells have their cell wall severely damaged, with mesosome-like membranous formations protruding into their  cytoplasm. although less pronounced, a similar effect was also observed with the  lac705beta peptide alone. furthermore, lac705beta increased the inhibitory action of a diluted supernatant of l. casei crl705, while lac705alpha protected crl691 cells from inhibition. both peptides were required to dissipate the proton motive force (deltapsi and deltaph) of crl691 cells. these data suggested that of the two components of lactocin 705, the lac705alpha peptide is responsible for receptor recognition, and the lac705beta peptide is the active component on the cell membrane of crl691 cells.

AB  == in the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, and enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. the lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. by studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. lactobacillus plantarum o236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. the intracellular and extracellular fractions of leuconostoc mesenteroides o257, lactobacillus plantarum o236, and lactobacillus acidophilus o177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. l. plantarum o186, l. acidophilus o252, enterococcus faecium o174 and o426, and enterococcus faecalis ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. lactococcus lactis o233, l. plantarum o155, and lactobacillus casei o190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.

AB  == indigenously developed rwgt food mixture which contained rice flour, whey, sprouted green gram paste and tomato pulp (2:1:1:1 w/w) was autoclaved 1.5 kg/cm2, 15 min, 121 degrees c), cooled and fermented with 2% liquid culture (containing 10(6) cells/ml broth). two types of fermentations were carried out i.e. single culture fermentation [l. casei, l. plantarum (37 degrees c, 24 hr.)]  and sequential culture fermentation [s. boulardii (25 degrees c, 24 hr.) + l. casei (37 degrees c, 24 hr.)]; s. boulardii [(25 degrees c, 24 hr.) + l. plantarum (37 degrees c, 24 hr.)]. all the fermentations drastically reduced the  contents of phytic acid, polyphenols and trypsin inhibitor activity while significantly improving the in vitro digestibilities of starch and protein. sequential culture fermentations brought about higher changes as compared to single culture fermentations.

TI  == screening and selection of lactobacillus strains for use as adjunct cultures in production of semi-hard cheese.
AB  == thirty-three lactobacillus strains were tested as adjuncts in a cheese model system. eighteen strains originated from cheese (nine lactobacillus spp. and nine lb. paracasei/casei) and 15 from human intestinal mucosa (11 lb. rhamnosus; three lb. paracasei; one lb. plantarum). model cheeses weighing 120 g were made of cheese grains from full-scale production of washed curd semi-hard cheese (herrgard). the model system was reproducible and similar to full-scale production with respect to moisture, salt content, ph and microbial flora. the model cheeses were sampled for aerobic and anaerobic plate count and viable counts of lactobacillus and lactococcus. the presence of adjuncts in the model cheeses was confirmed by typing isolates with randomly amplified polymorphic dna  (rapd). the sensory properties of model cheeses were described. in a first trial  23 of the 33 adjuncts were re-isolated from the corresponding model cheeses after 9 or 13 weeks. adjuncts of lb. paracasei were re-isolated more frequently than adjuncts of lb. rhamnosus. nine strains were selected, on the basis of their ability to grow and be a dominating part of the microflora of model cheese with interesting sensory properties. these strains were further studied together with  two commercial cultures. the sensory influences on model cheeses of six of the adjuncts were confirmed, and flavour scores were in the range of 2.9-7.1 for model cheeses with different adjuncts while the control had a flavour score of 5.6 (0-10 scale). survival and growth of seven out of the nine strains correlated with the results of the first trial. growth and influence on flavour of four adjunct cultures were confirmed in experimental cheese manufactured in a 400-1 open vat.

TI  == the evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == efficient protoplast regeneration for some homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  == conditions for protoplast regeneration were examined for several strains of homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci isolated from silage. attempts to regenerate protoplasts using previously published agar regeneration media for lactobacilli were unsuccessful for most of the strains. replacing or increasing colloidal substances in a medium containing raffinose and mgcl(2) as osmotic stabilizers enabled efficient regeneration of the protoplasts at a frequency of 10-99%. a medium containing gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) and no agar was effective for lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus rhamnosus protoplasts. an agar medium containing pvp (pvp medium) was effective for pediococcus sp. protoplasts, and addition of agarose to the pvp medium enabled regeneration of lactobacillus casei protoplasts. a medium containing calcium alginate gel and no agar was effective for lactobacillus curvatus protoplasts. the type of colloidal substance required for protoplast regeneration varied from species to species. this result suggested that several kinds of media may be necessary to regenerate protoplasts for all the genera of lactobacilli and pediococci.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum initiate catabolism of methionine by transamination.
AB  == aims: to study the ability of lactobacillus casei and lact. plantarum strains to  convert methonine to cheese flavour compounds. methods and results: strains were  assayed for methionine aminotransferase and lyase activities, and amino acid decarboxylase activity. about 25% of the strains assayed showed methionine aminotransferase activity. the presence of glucose in the reaction mixture increased conversion of methionine to 4-methylthio-2-ketobutanoate (kmba) and 4-methylthio-2-hydroxybutanoate (hmba) in all strains. the methionine aminotransferase activity in lact. plantarum and lact. casei showed variable specificity for the amino group acceptors glyoxylate, ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvate. none of the strains showed methionine lyase or glutamate and methionine decarboxylase activities. conclusion: the presence of amino acid converting enzymes in lactobacilli is strain specific. significance and impact of the study: the findings of this work suggest that lactobacilli can be used as adjuncts for flavour formation in cheese manufacture.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest argentina.
AB  == indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest argentina. mean growth counts on m17, mrs, and mse agar media did not show significant differences (p < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. isolates of  lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as enterococcus (48%), lactococci  (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). all lactococci were identified  as lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. l. plantarum (93%), l. acidophilus (5%), and lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. l. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers.  l. plantarum and l. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. the majority of the lactobacilli and lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. enzyme activities (api-zym tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of l. plantarum strains were considerably higher. the predominance of l. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with  the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked  by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and  l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in  fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of  feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly  improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

TI  == microbial community dynamics during production of the mexican fermented maize dough pozol.
AB  == the dynamics of the microbial community responsible for the traditional fermentation of maize in the production of mexican pozol was investigated by using a polyphasic approach combining (i) microbial enumerations with culture media, (ii) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting of total community dna with bacterial and eukaryotic primers and sequencing of partial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes, (iii) quantification of rrnas from dominant microbial taxa by using phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, and (iv) analysis of sugars and fermentation products. a streptococcus species dominated the fermentation and accounted for between 25 and 75% of the total flora throughout the process. results also showed that the initial epiphytic aerobic microflora was replaced in the first 2 days by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (lab), including a close relative of lactobacillus fermentum, producing  lactic acid and ethanol; this heterolactic flora was then progressively replaced  by homofermentative lab (mainly close relatives of l. plantarum, l. casei, and l. delbrueckii) which continued acidification of the maize dough. at the same time,  a very diverse community of yeasts and fungi developed, mainly at the periphery of the dough. the analysis of the dgge patterns obtained with bacterial and eukaryotic primers targeting the 16s and 18s rdna genes clearly demonstrated that there was a major shift in the community structure after 24 h and that high biodiversity-according to the shannon-weaver index-was maintained throughout the  process. these results proved that a relatively high number of species, at least  six to eight, are needed to perform this traditional lactic acid fermentation. the presence of bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and enterobacteria suggests a fecal origin of some important pozol microorganisms. overall, the results obtained with different culture-dependent or -independent techniques clearly confirmed the importance of developing a polyphasic approach to study the ecology of fermented foods.

TI  == molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria from cassava sour starch (colombia).
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and more particularly lactobacilli and leuconostoc, are widely found in a wide variety of traditional fermented foods of tropical countries, made with cereals, tubers, meat or fish. these products represent a source of bacterial diversity that cannot be accurately analysed using classical  phenotypic and biochemical tests. in the present work, the identification and the molecular diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from cassava sour starch fermentation were assessed by using a combination of complementary molecular methods: randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd), plasmid profiling, hybridization using rrna phylogenetic probes and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the results revealed a large diversity of bacterial species (lb. manihotivorans, lb. plantarum, lb. casei, lb. hilgardii, lb. buchneri, lb. fermentum, ln. mesenteroides and pediococcus sp.). however, the most frequently isolated species were lb. plantarum and lb. manihotivorans. the rapd analysis revealed a large molecular diversity between lb. manihotivorans or lb. plantarum  strains. these results, observed on a rather limited number of samples, reveal that significant bacterial diversity is generated in traditional cassava sour starch fermentations. we propose that the presence of the amylolytic lb. manihotivorans strains could have a role in sour starch processing.

AB  == the delivery of antigens to mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues in paediatric and immunocompromised populations by safe, non-invasive vectors, such as commensal lactobacilli, represents a crucial improvement to prevailing vaccination options. in this report, we describe the oral and nasal immunization of mice with vaccines constructed through an original system for heterologous gene expression in lactobacillus in which the 50 000-molecular weight (mw) fragment c of tetanus toxin (ttfc) is expressed either as an intracellular or a surface-exposed protein. our data indicate that l. plantarum is more effective in this respect than l. casei and that, under the experimental conditions investigated, delivery  of ttfc expressed as an intracellular antigen is more effective than cell-surface expression. immunization of mice with live recombinant lactobacilli induced significant levels of circulating ttfc-specific immunoglobulin g (igg) following  nasal or oral delivery of vaccine strains. in addition, following nasal delivery, secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) was induced in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, as were antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells and antigen-specific t-cell activation in draining lymph nodes, substantiating their potential for safe mucosal delivery of paediatric vaccines.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == identification and nucleotide sequence of genes involved in the synthesis of lactocin 705, a two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus casei crl 705.
AB  == the structural gene determinants of lactocin 705, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus casei crl 705, have been amplified from a plasmid of approximately  35 kb and sequenced. lactocin 705 is a class iib bacteriocin, whose activity depends upon the complementation of two peptides (705alpha and 705beta) of 33 amino acid residues each. these peptides are synthesized as precursors with signal sequences of the double-glycine type, which exhibited high identities with the leader peptides of plantaricin s and j from lactobacillus plantarum, brochocin c from brochotrix campestris, sakacin p from lactobacillus sake, and the competence stimulating peptides from streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis. however, the two mature bacteriocins 705alpha and 705beta do not show significant similarity to other sequences in the databases.

TI  == development of a rapid method for the identification of lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented italian sausages using a polymerase chain reaction-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == a rapid method for the identification of lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented italian sausages was developed. it is based on the amplification of a small fragment from the 16s rrna gene followed by temperature  gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge). lactobacillus sakei, l. curvatus, l. alimentarius, l. casei, l. plantarum and l. brevis, obtained from international collections, were used to optimize the method. thiry-nine strains of lactobacillus spp. were isolated from naturally fermented sausages and, after traditional identification, were tested by the pcr-tgge protocol developed. no differences were observed comparing the results obtained, apart from five strains identified as l. curvatus that showed a pcr-tgge profile identical to l. sakei.

TI  == identification and characterization of enterococcus species isolated from forage  crops and their influence on silage fermentation.
AB  == forty-eight strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from forage crops, and  their identification, characterization and influence on silage fermentation were  studied. all isolates were gram-positive, short-chain-forming, catalase-negative, and facultatively anaerobic cocci that did not produce gas from glucose, only formed l-lactic acid, and were able to grow at ph 9.6%, in 6.5% nacl, or with 40% bile, but not below ph 4.5. these isolates were commonly isolated from forage crops, and they were divided into four groups (a, b, c, and d) according to sugar fermentation characteristics. selected strains of fa 5, fa 27, fa 45, and fa 57 were identified as enterococcus hirae, e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, and e. mundtii, respectively, on the basis of dna-dna homology, strains fa 5, fa 27, fa  45, and fa 57 and two strains from commercial inoculants, lc 10 (lactobacillus casei) and lp 15 (l. plantarum), were used as additives to alfalfa and guinea grass silages. alphalfa and guinea grass silages inoculated with lc 10, lp 15, fa 5 + lc 10, and fa 5 + lp 15-treatments in alfalfa and guinea grass silages had significantly lower ph values, contents of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen, gas production, and dry matter losses compared with the control silage after 60 d of  fermentation. however, the e. hirae fa 5, e. faecalis fa 27, e. casseliflavus fa  45, and e. mundtii fa 57-inoculated silages gave similar values to the control in both types of silage. the fa 27 + lc 10 and fa 27 + lp 15-inoculated silages did  not differ in fermentation quality from lc 10 and lp 15-inoculated silages alone. the results confirmed that enterococcus species were not able to improve silage quality.

TI  == collagen (cn-i) binding by gut lactobacilli.
AB  == four gut lactobacillus strains displaying the features which make them particularly promising for the preparation of probiotic products were investigated together with 5 fresh isolates and one collection strain of lactobacillus plantarum for their ability to bind type i collagen (cn-i). immobilised cn-i in microtitre plates was bound only by 3 strains of gut lactobacilli from piglets and the collection strain lactobacillus plantarum lhi 10 from prague in range of a570nm readings 0.114-0.221. six strains (isolates from turkeys and a calf) did not bind cn-i (a570nm < 0.1) in this assay. an influence of cultivation medium on cn-i binding was significant (p < 0.001) in all four adherent strains. significantly higher (p < 0.001) binding of cn-i was observed for lactobacillus casei l 81 and lactobacillus plantarum lhi 10 grown on solid medium (mrs agar) than for mrs broth-grown cells, however, lactobacillus plantarum l 5 and lactobacillus fermentum l 435 expressed significantly (p < 0.001) higher cn-i binding during cultivation in mrs broth. the specificity of the binding was confirmed because the cn-i binding by lactobacilli after their preincubation with this protein was completely abolished. three selected inhibitors (fucoidan, heparan sulphate and hyaluronic acid) significantly (p < 0.001) reduced cn-i binding by the lactobacillus plantarum l 5 strain. following  up on some earlier strain characteristics, these results suggest that the selected piglets lactobacilli are also able to bind cn-i and therefore should antagonize collagen niche colonization by various enteropathogens when used for probiotic purposes.

TI  == transport of d-xylose in lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus plantarum: evidence for a mechanism of facilitated diffusion via the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == we have identified and characterized the d-xylose transport system of lactobacillus pentosus. uptake of d-xylose was not driven by the proton motive force generated by malolactic fermentation and required d-xylose metabolism. the  kinetics of d-xylose transport were indicative of a low-affinity facilitated-diffusion system with an apparent k(m) of 8.5 mm and a v(max) of 23 nmol min(-1) mg of dry weight(-1). in two mutants of l. pentosus defective in the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system, growth on d-xylose was absent due to the lack of d-xylose transport. however, transport of the pentose was not totally abolished in a third mutant, which could be complemented after expression of the l. curvatus manb gene encoding the cytoplasmic eiib(man) component of the eii(man) complex. the eii(man) complex is also involved in d-xylose transport in l. casei atcc 393 and l. plantarum 80. these two species could transport and metabolize d-xylose after transformation with plasmids which  expressed the d-xylose-catabolizing genes of l. pentosus, xylab. l. casei and l.  plantarum mutants resistant to 2-deoxy-d-glucose were defective in eii(man) activity and were unable to transport d-xylose when transformed with plasmids containing the xylab genes. finally, transport of d-xylose was found to be the rate-limiting step in the growth of l. pentosus and of l. plantarum and l. casei  atcc 393 containing plasmids coding for the d-xylose-catabolic enzymes, since the doubling time of these bacteria on d-xylose was proportional to the level of eii(man) activity.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == brewing spoilage lactobacilli detected using monoclonal antibodies to bacterial surface antigens.
AB  == a panel of thirteen monoclonal antibodies (mabs) was assembled that reacts with surface antigens on eight of eleven lactobacillus brewing spoilage organisms, including one or more of l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. casei-alactosus, l. plantarum, or unspeciated isolate(s). immunoblotting was done to identify the antigens involved in mab binding. antigen stability in situ was tested by protease treatment and by surface antigen extraction of washed bacteria. protease susceptibility of extracted surface antigens was also examined. in most cases, lactobacillus surface antigens detected by the mabs appear to be noncovalently bound proteins readily altered or removed from the bacterium by various environmental conditions. this research identifies brewing conditions that need to be tested to ascertain whether bacterial surface antigen-reactive mabs can be  used for the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of lactobacillus brewing spoilage organisms.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

AB  == lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, and lactobacillus paraplantarum  (m.-c. curk, j.-c. hubert, and f. bringel, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 46:595-598, 1996) can hardly be distinguished on the basis of their phenotypes. unlike l. plantarum and l. paraplantarum, l. pentosus ferments glycerol and xylose but not  melezitose. we identified two l. pentosus strains (cnrz 1538 and cnrz 1544) which ferment glycerol and melezitose but not xylose. alpha-methyl-d-mannoside was fermented by 66% of the l. plantarum strains tested but not by l. paraplantarum strains. in this paper we describe a simple method to identify l. plantarum, l. pentosus, and l. paraplantarum. this method is based on nonradioactive southern-type hybridization between bgli dna digests of the lactobacilli tested and a dna probe (l. plantarum pyrdfe genes from strain ccm 1904). a total of 68 lactobacilli were classified into five groups on the basis of the bands detected. two groups contained l. plantarum strains; one of these groups contained 31 strains, including the type strain, and was characterized by bands at 7, 4, and 1 kb, and the other group contained strain lp 85-2 and was characterized by bands at 5 and 1.1 kb. only one band (a band at around 7 kb) was detected in the strains belonging to the l. pentosus group, and two bands (at 4 and 1 kb) were found in the strains belonging to the l. paraplantarum group. no hybridization was detected in the last group, which contained lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactobacillus leichmannii strains.

TI  == evaluation of numerical analysis of random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr as a method to differentiate lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus pentosus.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus pentosus grouped into one protein profile cluster at r > or = 0.70, separate from lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sake, and lactobacillus curvatus. similar sugar fermentation reactions were recorded for representative strains of l. plantarum and l. pentosus. representative strains, including the type of each species, were selected from the different protein profile clusters and their genetic relatedness determined by using numerical analysis of random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr. the type strains of l. plantarum (atcc 14917t) and l. pentosus (ncfb 363t) displayed different rapd profiles and grouped into two independent clusters, well separated from l. casei, l. curvatus, and l. sake. numerical analysis of rapd-pcr proved a reliable and accurate method to distinguish between strains of l. plantarum and l. pentosus.

TI  == the potential of lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  == oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). the adjuvant function of different lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. after  i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high dth responses were observed with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in different experimental model systems l. casei and l. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. a series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the l. casei l-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (pouwels and leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. lactobacilli synthesizing the  fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous  priming.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == expression of bacillus subtilis levanase gene in lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei.
AB  == two lactobacillus-escherichia coli shuttle vectors, harbouring the levanase gene  from bacillus subtilis under the control of its own promoter (plpew1) or behind the e. coli tac promoter (pesiew2), were constructed. lactobacillus plantarum showed the same growth characteristics on selective plates and in liquid media containing inulin, after transformation with either plpew1 or pesiew2. l. plantarum transformed with plpew1 could be selected on inulin plates, indicating  that levanase expression can be used as a food-grade selection system for lactobacillus. lactobacillus casei grew faster in inulin-containing medium than l. plantarum after transformation with pesiew2, but did not grow when harbouring  plpew1. inulin-degrading activities of 90 mu/ml were found in culture medium of l. plantarum containing plpew1 or pesiew2, and of 500 mu/ml in medium of l. casei (pesiew2). addition of 1 mm isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside to the culture medium had no effect on growth and levanase expression in l. plantarum (pesiew2)  and l. casei (pesiew2) strains. levanase produced by l. casei (pesiew2) has a size of 75 kda and 72 kda, corresponding to that of unprocessed and mature b. subtilis levanase, respectively, suggesting that the protein produced is recognized and processed by a signal peptidase.

TI  == the lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, pediococcus and leuconostoc species, l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum  and l. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. the lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal ph and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. the cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. in the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). by  contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. the presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. no doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. meanwhile the obtention of a lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified pl1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of l. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.

TI  == studies on bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus isolates from selected nigerian fermented foods.
AB  == ten bacteriocin-producing (bacteriocinogenic) lactobacillus isolates obtained from three nigerian fermented foods namely: kenkey, ogi and wara were tested against the following indicator organisms: lactobacillus plantarum and food borne pathogens comprising enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, serratia, pseudomonas, vibrio cholerae, aeromonas sobria, aeromonas cavice, salmonella typhimurium, plesiomonas shigelloides and staphylococcus aureus. all the bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus were found to inhibit l. plantarum while some inhibited some of the food borne pathogens listed above. the antimicrobial activities of bacteriocins from l. plantarum kky12 and l. casei ogm12 were caused by proteins detectable in the culture liquids. they are designated plantacin n and caseicin a and they have narrow antimicrobial spectra. plantacin n from l. plantarum kky12 was active against l. plantarum, pseudomonas, aeromonas sobria and aeromonas cavice whereas caseicin a from l. casei ogm12 inhibited l. plantarum, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and vibrio cholerae. caseicin a is stable at 121 degrees c/15 mins, and both are inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. the bacteriocinogenic properties of the local isolates of lactobacillus can help to reduce hygienic risk and the spoilage of fermented foods.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == divergence in codon usage of lactobacillus species.
AB  == we have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different lactobacillus species. codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. codon usage in l. acidophilus is similar to that in l. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. pentosus and l. plantarum. codon usage in  the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from  that in l. bulgaricus. inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in  part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. l. bulgaricus shows gc drift, whereas all other species show at drift. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus  rarely use nng in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. this result may be explained by assuming that l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single trna species for translation of family-box codons. differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. the gc content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. the possible implications of a reduced gc content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.

AB  == one hundred strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from dry cured sausages were tested for antagonistic activity against a set of test strains. nine of 52 strains of lactobacillus casei and three of 48 strains of lact. plantarun produced inhibition zones against the indicator species. the substance excreted by lact. casei crl 705 was active against lact. plantarum, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus and a wide range of gram-negative bacteria.  the activity of the antibacterial compound from lact. casei crl 705 was destroyed by papain, trypsin and pepsin, but was resistant to heat (100 degrees c for 20 min), lysozyme and catalase. the agent was produced during the growth cycle and when the concentrated and neutralized supernatant fluid was added to a fresh culture of sensitive cells it produced a rapid inactivation. a decrease in optical density (o.d.) over time, indicative of cell lysis, was also observed. these characteristics allowed us to identify the inhibitory compound as a bacteriocin which we termed lactocin 705.

TI  == d-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of the d-isomer-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family. cloning, sequencing, and expression in escherichia coli of  the d-lactate dehydrogenase gene of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == the gene encoding d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-lactate: nad+ oxidoreductase, ec 1.1.1.28) of lactobacillus plantarum has been sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli cells with an inducible expression plasmid, in which the 5'-noncoding region of the gene was replaced with the tac promoter. comparison of the sequence of d-lactate dehydrogenase with l-lactate dehydrogenases, including  the l. plantarum l-lactate dehydrogenase, showed no significant homology. in contrast, the d-lactate dehydrogenase is homologous to e. coli d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and lactobacillus casei d-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. this indicates that d-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of a new family of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases recently proposed, being distinct from l-lactate dehydrogenase and l-malate dehydrogenase, and strongly suggests that the new family consists of d-isomer-stereospecific enzymes. in the reductive reaction, the enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity, although pyruvate was  the most favorable of all 2-ketocarboxylic acids tested. in particular, hydroxypyruvate is effectively reduced by the enzyme, the reaction rate, and km value being comparable to those in the case of pyruvate, indicating that the enzyme has not only d-lactate dehydrogenase activity but also d-glycerate dehydrogenase activity. the conserved residues in this family appear to be the residues involved in the substrate binding and the catalytic reaction, and thus to be targets for site-directed mutagenesis.

TI  == influence of aflatoxin b1 on gas production by lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == sensitivity of different species of lactobacillus i.e. l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophillus, l. buchneri, l. jugurti and others to penicillins and cephalosporins of various generations was studied. penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of the lactobacillus species were specified. it was shown that the number  of pbps depended on the lactobacillus species. l. casei had the least number of pbps (4) and l. brevis had the highest number of pbps (11). competition of 14c-benzylpenicillin with ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime and cefoperazone for binding to separate pbps in three strains of different lactobacillus species  was investigated.

TI  == superoxide dismutase activity in some strains of lactobacilli: induction by manganese.
AB  == dialyzed cell-free extract of lactobacilli was found to contain superoxide dismutase activity by using a test system in which superoxide ion is generated by xanthine oxidase. the specific activities of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus murinus atcc 35020, lactobacillus acidophilus crl 358, lactobacillus plantarum atcc 8014, lactobacillus casei crl 431, lactobacillus plantarum crl 353, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 9338, lactobacillus buchneri ncdo 110, and lactobacillus fermentum crl 251 were between 0.06 and 0.43 u/mg protein. the presence of superoxide dismutase activity was demonstrated when the strains were grown in media containing mn2+ ions. superoxide dismutase of lactobacilli may be an mn enzyme since it was not inhibited by either cyanide or azide ions. however, the cell-free extract of lactobacillus murinus atcc 35020 contains superoxide dismutase activity sensitive to both ions.

TI  == characterization of a lactobacillus strain producing white crystals on cheddar cheese.
AB  == from an enrichment culture of white-crystal deposits from aged cheddar cheese, an atypical lactobacillus strain was characterized. the new isolate is facultatively heterofermentative, has a g + c content of 40 mol%, and produces d and l isomers  of lactic acid. the strain had a limited ability to ferment carbohydrates. it utilized fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, mannose, and ribose but  was negative for esculin, gluconate, citrate, and several other carbon sources. the isolate also had low dna-dna homologies with strains of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum. cheese prepared with milk containing the isolate developed white crystals during curing. formation of copious d-lactate from unknown substrates during curing probably caused the white-crystal deposits. the  strain has been deposited in the american type culture collection (atcc 49178).

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == enhancement of host resistance against listeria infection by lactobacillus casei: efficacy of cell wall preparation of lactobacillus casei.
AB  == cell wall, cytoplasm, polysaccharide, and peptidoglycan fractions prepared from lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, and l. acidophilus were examined for their efficacies to enhance resistance of host mice against listeria monocytogenes infection. intraperitoneal injections of those cellular fractions of l. casei led to elicitation of inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity and the efficacy was highest in the case of peptidoglycan. macrophage ratio in the resultant peritoneal exudate cells was also highest in mice given peptidoglycan. macrophages induced with cell wall fraction of l. casei showed the most potent phorbol myristate acetate (pma)-triggered respiratory burst (chemiluminescence and o2- production determined on the basis of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) followed by those elicited with peptidoglycan. all the macrophages induced with cell wall of l. casei (two strains) and l. acidophilus enhanced o2- production in response to pma but l. plantarum did not enhance o2(-)-producing ability in such  a manner. the l. casei-cell wall also enhanced in vitro listericidal activity of  mouse peritoneal macrophages, but such an activity was not noted in the case of l. acidophilus-cell wall. when mice were intravenously given the cellular fractions 7 or 13 days before l. monocytogenes infection, cell wall fractions of  l. casei caused the most potent protective activity. a weak protective activity was also found in peptidoglycan of l. casei. therefore, the protective action of  l. casei against l. monocytogenes infection in host mice may be attributed to cell wall compounds and partially to the peptidoglycan moiety.

TI  == lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
AB  == similar to streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when  treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. for lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at phs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate.  for f. nucleatum suspended at ph 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/l bicarbonate activation. when lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, ph  5.3, lysis was observed only with l. plantarum and s. mutans, but not with l. casei. the latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. in experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for l. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to  salivary factors other than lysozyme. f. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral ph, suggesting that both gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.

AB  == fractionation of cell-free extracts of lactobacillus casei ncdo 151 (grown in man's et al.

AB  == crude cell-free extracts of some strains of each l. casei and l. plantarum were assayed for their amino-, imino- and endopeptidase as well as the caseinolytic activity. l-alanine-, l-phenylalanine- and l-leucine-p-nitroanilide but not l-glutamic acid-p-nitroanilide, were hydrolyzed by all the strains indicating an  amino-peptidase activity. the activity of proline iminopeptidase was very low compared to that of the aminopeptidase. l. casei could be distinguished from l. plantarum by its high endopeptidase activity against succinyl-phenylalanine- and  glutaryl-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide. the caseinolytic activity of cell-free extract of l. casei atcc 393 was about one seventh the caseinolytic activity of intact cells, suggesting that the bulk of the cellular proteinase activity is located in the cell wall. it appears that a metallo aminopeptidase and a probable cysteine one are involved in the hydrolysis of amino acid-p-nitroanilide, whereas the endopeptidase activity appears to be related to a cysteine enzyme. incubation of gels with l-leucine-p-nitroanilide after electrophoresis allowed the revealing of 2 zones of aminopeptidase activity in a strain of l. casei and only one in two others, but in l. plantarum it did not allow the revealing of any. the high proteolytic activities of l. casei compared to those of l. plantarum may explain  its more frequent occurrence in cheese and its probable role in the ripening of many cheese varieties.

TI  == multiple nutritional requirements of lactobacilli: genetic lesions affecting amino acid biosynthetic pathways.

AB  == the effect of lactobacillus species on urinary indican excretion in two types of  gnotobiotic rats (gbh-9 and gb-5) and in man was studied. l. salivarius, l. plantarum and l. casei colonized in the cecum and colon of both types of rats at  levels of 10(7) to 10(8) per gram of contents following one-dose oral administration and caused a significant reduction in urinary indican excretion, whereas two strains of l. acidophilus which colonized at low levels (10(4) to 10(5)/g) did not reduce indican excretion. daily feeding of lactobacillus concentrates caused a further significant reduction in indican excretion which was corrected by tryptophan intake, even in the case of l. acidophilus. there was a clear relationship between fecal lactobacillus counts and urinary indican. a significant reduction of indican secretion was obtained only when the fecal counts of lactobacilli exceeded 10(7).4/g in rats. l. casei also had an effect in man, reducing urinary excretion of indican and p-cresol. reduction in indican excretion seems to be accompanied by decreasing fecal tryptophanase activity in rats and man. a negative correlation was also obtained between fecal resident lactobacilli and urinary indican in man (r = -0.532, n = 28, p less than 0.01). subjects with lactobacilli at a level of 10(6)/g or more excreted less indican than those harboring the bacteria at levels below 10(5)/g.

TI  == factors affecting the quaternary structure of the allosteric l-lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvatus as investigated by hybridization and ultracentrifugation.
AB  == the allosteric l-lactate dehydrogenases of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus casei exist in the tetrameric from (molecular weight about 145 000) at ph 5.0--5.5 even in the absence of the effectors mn2+ and fru(1,6)p2 (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), but undergo reversible dissociation to monomers (molecular weight about 35 000) at higher ph values or in the presence of urea. in the range between ph 5.5 (tetrameric state) and ph 7.4 (monomeric state) the l. curvatus l-lactate dehydrogenase exists in a dissociation-association equilibrium comprising tetramers, dimers and monomers as indicated by the sc20,w values and the results of hybridization experiments. the simultaneous addition of both effectors [mn2+ and fru(1,6)p2] at ph 7.4, however, resulted in the stabilization of the tetrameric form. the addition of fru(1,6)p2 alone at ph 7.4 had almost no  influence on the quarternary structure, whereas the addition of mn2+, as well as  that of nadh, largely prevented dissociation. the l-lactate dehydrogenase of l. casei showed similar properties, although the enzyme dissociates only at about ph greater than or equal to 7.8. as in the case of the l. curvatus enzyme, fru(1,6)p2 has no influence on the ph-dependent dissociation of the l. casei enzyme, whereas mn2+ stabilizes the tetrameric structure. reconstitution of a mixture of the two dissociated enzymes results in the formation of all statistically possible, enzymatically active hybrids. no hybridization between the allosteric enzymes from l. casei and l. curvatus and the non-allosteric ones  of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus was observed.

AB  == the reassembly of tetragonally arranged subunits in the cell wall of lactobacillus brevis and the reattachment of the subunits to cell wall fragments  were investigated by electron microscopy. the subunits dissociated from the cell  wall with guanidine hydrochloride (ghcl) reassembled into the same regular array  as seen in native cell wall after dialysis against neutral buffer even in the absence of specific cations. the subunits could also reattach to the cell wall fragments from which they had been removed by treatment with ghcl, sodium dodecyl sulfate or cold trichloroacetic acid but not to those treated with hot formamide. heterologous reattachment of the subunits occurred on cell wall fragments obtained from l. fermentum but not on those from l plantarum or l. casei subsp. casei. on the basis of these observations and chemical analyses of the cell wall  fragments, the subunits of l. brevis appeared to be bound by hydrogen bonds to a  neutral polysaccharide moiety in the cell wall but not to peptidoglycan or teichoic acid.

AB  == the molecular weight, the amino acid composition and the n-terminal and c-terminal amino acids of two allosteric (lactobacillus casei, l. curvatus) and two non-allosteric (l. plantarum, l. acidophilus) l-lactate dehydrogenases, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, were determined. the amino acid composition of the only tryptic peptide unequivocally common to the fingerprints of the 4 enzymes is virtually identical with that of the arginine peptide, called arg6 of the the substratebinding site of the l-lactate dehydrogenase dehydrogenase of several animals. however, the 'essential' cysteine residue 165 is replaced by threonine, as it is in the l-lactate dehydrogenase of  lobster. in addition, the 4 bacterial peptides differ by one or two changes in single amino acid residues from each other as well as from those of animals. the  data indicate that not only the animal l-lactate dehydrogenases, but also the allosteric and lactate dehydrogenases from bacterial sources may have evolved from a common gene.
