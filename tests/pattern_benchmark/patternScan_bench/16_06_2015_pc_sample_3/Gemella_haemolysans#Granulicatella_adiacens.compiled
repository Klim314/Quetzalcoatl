TI  - Comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. We investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). By using culture-independent 16S rRNA approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. RESULTS: DGGE fingerprints showed variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. The clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and uncultivated TM7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. In combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. Bacterial species, Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorum, Johnsonella ignava and Streptococcus parasanguinis I were highly associated with tumor site where as Granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. Streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. CONCLUSIONS: The underlying changes in the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of OSCC subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. These most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be associated with OSCC and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.
TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological studies of children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment.
AB  - PURPOSE: This case-controlled study examined clinical and microbiological parameters in Brazilian children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment using fixed orthodontic appliances or removable orthodontic appliances. METHODS: The plaque index, gingival index, number of decayed, missing and filled teeth, and probing pocket depth was measured on each fully erupted tooth in 30 patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. The same parameters were also measured in 18 patients treated with removable orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. In the patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four teeth with orthodontic brackets and from four teeth with orthodontic bands. In the patients with removable appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from clasped maxillary permanent first molar teeth and from four unclasped permanent teeth. Samples of unstimulated whole saliva and samples from the dorsal surface of the tongue were also obtained from each subject. Each sample was analyzed for the presence of 19 target bacteria by dot blot. A subset of samples was examined by direct amplification of bacterial nucleic acids. RESULTS: Compared to their respective age and sex-matched controls, whole mouth means for plaque index and gingival index were significantly elevated in both the fixed and removable orthodontic groups. There was no difference in the DMFT. Subjects with fixed orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of each of the target species except for L. fermentum, Neisseriaceae and S. mutans. The prevalence of A. naeslundii and Streptococcus sp. was significantly higher on teeth with orthodontic brackets alone compared to teeth with both orthodontic bands and brackets. Subjects with removable orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, L. fermentum, Neisseriaceae, and spirochetes. The prevalence of Neisseriaceae was significantly higher on unclasped teeth compared to clasped teeth. There was no difference between sample sites for the target bacteria except for A. actinomycetemcomitans that was detected less frequently in saliva. Orthodontic patients demonstrated higher proportions of gram negative species by direct amplification of nucleic acids including species frequently associated with periodontal disease as well as rarely cultivable or non-cultivable species such as Abiotrophia defectiva, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lautropia sp., Terrahaemophilus aromaticivorans, and TM7 bacterium.
TI  - Use of groESL as a target for identification of Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and  Gemella species.
AB  - We determined the groESL sequences of three species of nutritionally variant streptococci (Abiotrophia defectiva, Granulicatella adiacens, and Granulicatella elegans) and three Gemella species (Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, and Gemella sanguinis). The nucleotide sequence similarities between the groES and groEL genes of the above genera were 41.7 to 85.9% and 63.7 to 84.3%, respectively. The intraspecies similarities of groESL sequences for the isolates of Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species were 94.4 to 97.8% for groES and 94.0 to 98.2% for groEL. For Ge. morbillorum and Ge. sanguinis, all strains showed the same groESL spacer length (8 bp), and sequence identities within species were >97.8% for groES and >96.1% for groEL. However, higher intraspecies heterogeneity was observed in Ge. haemolysans. Phylogenetic analysis of groEL sequences separated the 6 isolates of Ge. haemolysans into two subgroups. Among these isolates, three isolates with the same groESL spacer region length (45 bp) clustered together but were distant from the ATCC reference strain (with a spacer length of 8 bp). The remaining three isolates, with a spacer length of 50 or 8 bp, clustered together. Although 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis did not provide enough discrimination for the 6 Ge. haemolysans isolates, rpoB gene sequence analysis supported the subgrouping. Based on the obtained groESL sequences, we developed a multiplex PCR that enables simple, rapid, and accurate identification of Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and Gemella at the genus level. This assay would be helpful for identifying these fastidious and slow-growing organisms in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  - Previously, we reported that intracellular Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. In this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using the same double-labeling techniques to identify Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, oral Campylobacter species, Eikenella corrodens, Treponema denticola, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. All those species were found within buccal cells. In every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. Streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (G. adiacens). This is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular characterization of erythromycin resistance in four isolates of Streptococcus-like gram-positive cocci causing bacteremia.
AB  - Among nine patients with bacteremia caused by Granulicatella or Gemella in a 6-year period (July 1995 to June 2001), three had bacteremia caused by erythromycin-resistant Granulicatella adiacens and one had bacteremia caused by erythromycin-resistant Gemella haemolysans. All four isolates possessed mef genes, whereas none possessed ermT, ermTR, or ermB genes.
