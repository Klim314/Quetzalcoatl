TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == culture-dependent and -independent methods to investigate the microbial ecology of italian fermented sausages.
AB  == in this study, the microbial ecology of three naturally fermented sausages produced in northeast italy was studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods. by plating analysis, the predominance of lactic acid bacteria populations was pointed out, as well as the importance of coagulase-negative cocci. also in the case of one fermentation, the fecal enterocci reached significant counts, highlighting their contribution to the particular transformation process. yeast counts were higher than the detection limit (> 100  cfu/g) in only one fermented sausage. analysis of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) patterns and sequencing of the bands allowed profiling of  the microbial populations present in the sausages during fermentation. the bacterial ecology was mainly characterized by the stable presence of lactobacillus curvatus and lactobacillus sakei, but lactobacillus paracasei was also repeatedly detected. an important piece of evidence was the presence of lactococcus garvieae, which clearly contributed in two fermentations. several species of staphylococcus were also detected. regarding other bacterial groups, bacillus sp., ruminococcus sp., and macrococcus caseolyticus were also identified at the beginning of the transformations. in addition, yeast species belonging to  debaryomyces hansenii, several candida species, and willopsis saturnus were observed in the dgge gels. finally, cluster analysis of the bacterial and yeast dgge profiles highlighted the uniqueness of the fermentation processes studied.
