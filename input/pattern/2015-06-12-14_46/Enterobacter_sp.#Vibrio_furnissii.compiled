TI  - Purification, characterization and gene analysis of N-acetylglucosaminidase from  Enterobacter sp. G-1.
AB  - Enterobacter sp. G-1 is a bacterium isolated previously as a chitinase-producing  bacterium. We found this bacterium also produced N-acetylglucosaminidase and characterized that in this study. Extracellular N-acetylglucosaminidase of 92.0 kDa was purified near homogeneity by 8.57-fold from Enterobacter sp. G-1. The optimum temperature and the optimum pH of the purified N-acetylglucosaminidase was 45 degrees C and 6.0, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of 23 residues of N-acetylglucosaminidase was identified. Based on the N-terminal sequence, we amplified pieces of the DNA fragments by PCR. Using these PCR products as probes, we screened the genomic library and successfully isolated the entire N-acetylglucosaminidase gene (designated nag1) from Enterobacter sp. G-1. The nucleotide sequence of the nag1 gene was found to consist of 2,655 bp encoding a protein of 885 amino acid residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence from the nag1 gene found 97.3% identity with chitobiase from Serratia marcescens, 54.4% identity with N,N'-diacetylchitobiase from Vibrio harveyi, and 42.7% identity with N-acetylglucosaminidase (ExoI) from Vibrio furnissii. Enzymatic activity assay of N-acetylglucosaminidase indicated stronger activity toward PNP-GlcNAc than PNP-(GlcNAc)2 or PNP-(GlcNAc)3.
