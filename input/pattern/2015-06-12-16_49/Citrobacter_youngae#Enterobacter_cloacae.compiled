TI  - Antibacterial susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae isolated from raw horsemeat isolated for human consumption (basashi).
AB  - Drug susceptibility testing was carried out using 14 antibiotics in order to identify trends in the antibiotic tolerance of 142 strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from horsemeat commercially available for raw consumption (basashi). A comparison of the sensitivity to the 14 antibiotics using the 90% MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) values (MIC90) showed the strongest tolerance to ampicillin (ABPC) at a concentration of > 128 mug/mL, followed by that to fosfomycin (FOM) at a concentration of 128 mug/mL. When the sensitivity to these antibiotics was examined for each individual genus of tested bacteria, Hafnia spp. exhibited relative tolerance to ceftazidime (CAZ) and ceftriaxone (CTRX) at a concentration of 4 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively, which was high in comparison to that observed for the other strains. Furthermore, Raoultella spp. and Serratia spp. were found to be highly resistant to tetracycline (TC) at a concentration of 128 mug/mL and 64 mug/mL, respectively. Of the 142 strains of test bacteria, 140 (98.6%) demonstrated resistance to ABPC, with the exception of Hafnia alvei and Klebsiella pneumonia. In addition, a total of eight strains (5.6%), seven Serratia marcescens strains and one Raoultella terrigena strain, were found to be resistant to TC. Furthermore, one strain of Citrobacter freundii exhibited resistance to nalidixic acid (NA), while another displayed resistance to ofloxacin (OFLX) (0.7% each), and one strain (0.7%) each of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter youngae demonstrated resistance to fosfomycin (FOM), streptomycin (SM) and kanamycin (KM), respectively. A single strain of C. freundii was found to be resistant to three antibiotics, ABPC, NA and OFLX. Resistance to two antibiotics was confirmed in 11 strains, including seven strains of S. marcescens and one strain of R. terrigena (a total of eight strains) resistant to ABPC and TC, and one strain each of C. youngae, S. marcescens and E. cloacae resistant to ABPC and KM, ABPC and SM, and ABPC and FOM, respectively. In addition, 128 strains were resistant to the single antibiotic of ABPC alone. Of the 140 strains demonstrating antibiotic resistance, 137 (97.9%) retained the conjugative R-plasmid transfer factor, excluding three strains of S. marcescens. All transfer factors were ABPC and retained by a high proportion of the bacterial groups, with one strain (100%) being resistant to three antibiotics, nine (81.8%) of the 11 strains being resistant to two antibiotics, and 127 (99.2%) of the 128 strains being resistant to a single antibiotic. In addition, we examined ESBL productivity in the 140 strains of bacteria demonstrating drug tolerance; however, no strains exhibited this characteristic. Therefore, further observation is required to ascertain trends in antibiotic-tolerant bacteria.
TI  - ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae: occurrence, risk factors for fecal carriage and strain traits in the Swiss slaughter cattle population younger than 2 years sampled at abattoir level.
AB  - During the past decade extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae have become a matter of great concern in human and veterinary medicine. In this cross-sectional study fecal swabs of a geographically representative number of Swiss cattle at slaughterhouse level were sampled i) to determine the occurrence of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae in the Swiss slaughter cattle population younger than 2 years, and ii) to assess risk factors for shedding ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae. In total, 48 (8.4%; 95% C.I. 6.3-11.1%) independent ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected among the 571 tested animals. Species identification revealed 46 E. coli strains, one Enterobacter cloacae and one Citrobacter youngae. In view of beta-lactam antibiotics, all 48 isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin and cefpodoxime. Forty-five (93.8%) isolates were resistant cefuroxime; one (2.1%) isolate to cefoxitin, 28 (58.3%) isolates to cefotaxime, 2 (4.2%) isolates to ceftazidime, and 2 (4.2%) isolates to cefepime. Risk factors for shedding ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae were (i) age (OR 0.19 and 0.12 in age category 181 d to 1 y and 1 y to 2 y compared to </=180 d), (ii) primary production type, meaning dairy compared to beef on farm of origin (OR 5.95), and (iii) more than 1 compared to less than 1 animal movement per d per 100 animals on farm of origin (OR 2.37).
TI  - Occurrence and characteristics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae in food producing animals, minced meat and raw milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of food animals as a possible reservoir for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae, and the dissemination of such strains into the food production chain need to be assessed. In this study 334 fecal samples from pigs, cattle, chicken and sheep were investigated at slaughter. Additionally, 100 raw milk samples, representing bulk tank milk of 100 different dairy farms, 104 minced meat (pork and beef) samples and 67 E. coli isolates from cattle E. coli mastitis were analyzed. RESULTS: As many as 15.3% of the porcine, 13.7% of the bovine, 8.6% of the sheep and 63.4% of the chicken fecal samples yielded ESBL producers after an enrichment step. In contrast, none of the minced meat, none of the bulk tank milk samples and only one of the mastitis milk samples contained ESBL producing strains. Of the total of 91 isolates, 89 were E. coli, one was Citrobacter youngae and one was Enterobacter cloacae. PCR analysis revealed that 78 isolates (85.7%) produced CTX-M group 1 ESBLs while six isolates (6.6%) produced CTX-M group 9 enzymes. Five detected ESBLs (5.5%) belonged to the SHV group and 2 isolates (2.2%) contained a TEM-type enzyme. A total of 27 CTX-M producers were additionally PCR-positive for TEM-beta-lactamase. The ESBL-encoding genes of 53 isolates were sequenced of which 34 produced CTX-M-1, 6 produced CTX-M-14, 5 produced CTX-M-15 and also 5 produced SHV-12. Two isolates produced TEM-52 and one isolate expressed a novel CTX-M group 1 ESBL, CTX-M-117. One isolate--aside from a CTX-M ESBL-- contained an additional novel TEM-type broad-spectrum beta-lactamase, TEM-186. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high rates of ESBL producers in food animals and the high genetic diversity among these isolates are worrisome and indicate an established reservoir in farm animals.
TI  - Production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  - Histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (41 of Hafnia alvei, 17 of Serratia liquefaciens, 5 of Enterobacter cloacae, 4 of Citrobacter braakii, 2 of Proteus vulgaris, 2 of Proteus mirabilis, 2 of Providencia stuartii, 2 of Klebsiella terrigena, 1 of Rahnella aquatilis, 1 of Salmonella arizonae, 1 of Citrobacter youngae and 1 of Escherichia coli) isolated from Botillo, a Spanish traditional sausage. In general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the exception of two strains of H. alvei and the E. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. The strains of P. mirabilis and P. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. Accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. Biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. Maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the R. aquatilis strain to 7325 mg/l in a H. alvei strain. Maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the R. aquatilis strain to 1935 mg/l in a S. liquefaciens strain.
TI  - Analysis of AmpC beta-lactamase expression and sequence in biochemically atypical ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from paediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the variation of ampC beta-lactamase gene sequence and expression in biochemically atypical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, and to identify them definitively. METHODS: beta-Lactamase gene-containing recombinant plasmids transformed into Escherichia coli were selected using ampicillin. PCR analysis was used to locate specific ampC and 16S rRNA genes, and the amplicons were sequenced. Random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR was used to group isolates and API 20E biochemical profiling was used to identify them putatively. RESULTS: Of 50 ceftazidime-resistant clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 36 were identified (>95% confidence)-using API 20E test strips-as being organisms known to express inducible class C beta-lactamases (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii or Hafnia alvei). The rest were biochemically atypical. Of these, isolate I113, putatively identified as E. coli, possesses a chromosomally encoded ampC which differs by 15% from C. freundii OS60 ampC and by >30% from E. coli ampC. A related ampC gene was found in another seven of the atypical isolates. The use of various identification methods, including ampC sequence analysis, revealed that these I113-like ampC-positive isolates represent Citrobacter murliniae and Citrobacter youngae. CONCLUSIONS: We report sequences for two new Citrobacter spp. ampC genes, and provide evidence that ampC sequencing is a discriminatory method for identifying atypical Citrobacter spp. isolates.
