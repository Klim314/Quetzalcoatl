TI  == reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == [protease activity of microflora in the oral cavity of patients with periodontitis].
AB  == microbial spectrum and non-specific as well as specific iga1 protease activity of isolated microorganisms were investigated in gingival liquid of patients with periodontitis. microorganisms from the gingival liqud of these patients belonged  to conditional-pathogenic obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. 24 strains of microorganisms have been identified. nonspecific proteolytic activity  was found in the following microorganisms: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, aerococcus viridans, bifidobacterium longum, neisseria subflave, streptococcus parvulus, eubacterium alactolyticum, lactobaccilus catenoforme, bacillus spp. specific iga1-protease activity and lack of proteolytic activity towards igg was found in streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus hansenii, streptococcus salivarius, leptotrychia buccalis, staphylococcus haemolyticus and  neisseria sicca. no proteolytic activity was found in cultivation medium of eubacterium alactolyticum (1 strain), prevotella buccalis, aerococcus viridans and streptococcus sanguis.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
