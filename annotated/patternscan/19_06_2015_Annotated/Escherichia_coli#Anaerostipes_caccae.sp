TI  == na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede h+-translocating pyrophosphatases.
AB  == membrane pyrophosphatases (ppases), divided into k(+)-dependent and k(+)-independent subfamilies, were believed to pump h(+) across cell membranes until a recent demonstration that some k(+)-dependent ppases function as na(+) pumps. here, we have expressed seven evolutionarily important putative ppases in  escherichia coli and estimated their hydrolytic, na(+) transport, and h(+) transport activities as well as their k(+) and na(+) requirements in inner membrane vesicles. four of these enzymes (from anaerostipes caccae, chlorobium limicola, clostridium tetani, and desulfuromonas acetoxidans) were identified as  k(+)-dependent na(+) transporters. phylogenetic analysis led to the identification of a monophyletic clade comprising characterized and predicted na(+)-transporting ppases (na(+)-ppases) within the k(+)-dependent subfamily. h(+)-transporting ppases (h(+)-ppases) are more heterogeneous and form at least three independent clades in both subfamilies. these results suggest that rather than being a curious rarity, na(+)-ppases predominantly constitute the k(+)-dependent subfamily. furthermore, na(+)-ppases possibly preceded h(+)-ppases in evolution, and transition from na(+) to h(+) transport may have occurred in several independent enzyme lineages. site-directed mutagenesis studies facilitated the identification of a specific glu residue that appears to be central in the transport mechanism. this residue is located in the cytoplasm-membrane interface of transmembrane helix 6 in na(+)-ppases but shifted to within the membrane or helix 5 in h(+)-ppases. these results contribute to the prediction of the transport specificity and k(+) dependence for a particular membrane ppase sequence based on its position in the phylogenetic tree, identity  of residues in the k(+) dependence signature, and position of the membrane-located glu residue.

TI  == human intestinal microbiota: characterization of a simplified and stable gnotobiotic rat model.
AB  == the study of host microbe interactions is hampered by the complexity and inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota. therefore, a simplified human intestinal microbiota (sihumi) consisting of seven bacterial species was introduced into germfree rats. species selection was based on numerical importance and fermentative abilities in the human gut. association of the rats with the sihumi (anaerostipes caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium longum, blautia producta, clostridium ramosum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum) resulted in increased faecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids compared to germfree animals. since the faecal butyrate concentration was low (0.9 +/- 0.5 micromol/g dry matter) the sihumi was complemented with clostridium butyricum. this extended bacterial community (sihumix) led to an increased faecal butyrate concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.7 micromol/g dry matter. besides forming scfa, the sihumix was capable of degrading mucins, beta-aspartylglycine and bilirubin. these features are characteristic of  conventional animals but not observed in germfree animals. dietary interventions  with modifications in fibre and fat content led to changes in the proportion of community members. the relative increase of one member of this community in response to a high-fat diet reflects the situation reported for obese mice and human subjects. the strength of the model communities is their remarkable stability over time and their easy transfer to the offspring.
