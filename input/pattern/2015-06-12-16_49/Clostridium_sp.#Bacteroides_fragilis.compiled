TI  - [Assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile. This study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) and C. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. METHODS: The strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical Uniwersity of Warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the API20 ANA (bioMerieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) system. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using E-test. RESULTS: The rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of BFG was respectively 84% and 31% and among of C. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). The percentage of BFG strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. The percentage of C. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. Reduced level of susceptibility of BFG strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. Resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of BFG strains. All tested strains as well as BFG and C. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. Was observed reduced leve (EUCAST) of susceptibility of C. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). CONCLUSIONS. Increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in Poland. This demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). However, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to SDG conversion. Therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of SDG metabolising bacteria. The data showed differences in conversion efficiency between SDG deglycosylating species, but SDG was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. The strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db showed the highest initial rate of SDG deglycosylation. Furthermore, we found that Bacteroides distasonis and B. fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. However, Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only two out of 20 faecal samples. Bacteria involved in the demethylation step of SDG conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than SDG. In particular, Peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. Finally, Eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.
TI  - Phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) via secoisolariciresinol (SECO) to the enterolignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). However, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. Therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of SDG. Strains of Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db, deglycosylated SDG. Demethylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, Eubacterium callanderi, Eubacterium limosum and Peptostreptococcus productus. Dehydroxylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Clostridium scindens and Eggerthella lenta. Finally, the newly isolated strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ED to EL. The results indicate that the activation of SDG involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. The anaerobes recovered in these studies were Gram-negative bacilli (including Bacteroides fragilis and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp.), Clostridium sp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and Actinomyces sp. In many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. The recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. These antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.
TI  - Clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp., Clostridium sp., and Fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. The strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. Predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. Organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. When anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. The early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria and intrahepatic stones: detections of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect anaerobic bacteria Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis  in intrahepatic stones by molecular genetic method. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 59 stone samples and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Clostridium sp. and the glutamine synthetase gene of Bacteroides fragilis. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed to identify the Clostridium sp. RESULTS: 16S rRNA gene sequences for Clostridium sp. were identified in 49 stones (83%, 49/59). The two most common groups were detected in 19 (41%) and 17 (37%) of the 46 samples using SSPC analysis, and 25/59 (42%) stones were tested positive for Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobes such as Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis present in intrahepatic stones and may play a role in stone formation. PCR is a useful technique to detect fastidious pathogens, which are difficult to culture. SSCP of PCR products is a rapid method in differentiating bacterial species.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - Cloning of an EF-P homologue from Bacteroides fragilis that increases B. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Investigations of possible regulators of Bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (GS) activity were done in Escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. The B. fragilis glnA gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pACYC184 and expressed in the E. coli glnA ntrB ntrC deletion strain, YMC11. GS activity was monitored following co-transformation with a B. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pEcoR251. A gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in B. fragilis GS activity but did not affect the activity of the E. coli GS enzyme or the B. fragilis sucrase (ScrL). Deletion of the B. fragilis glnA downstream region decreased basal levels of GS activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the B. fragilis GS activity. Reporter gene analysis, using the B. fragilis glnA promoter region fused to the promoterless Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. This demonstrated that the increase in GS activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. Sequence data indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor P (EF-P) proteins, the highest being to that of a Synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to Mycobacterium genitalium (27%). Amino acid identity to the E. coli EF-P was intermediate (37%). A possible role for EF-P in enhancing translation of the B. fragilis glnA mRNA is proposed.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Bacteroides infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1990, 336 Bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. They comprised 180 (54%) B. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) B. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) B. vulgatus, 34 (10%) B. distasonis, 21 (6%) B. ovatus and 10 (3%) B. uniformis. Infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a Bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. Most Bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). Predisposing conditions were present in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). The micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with Bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), Escherichia coli (122), Fusobacterium spp. (38) and Clostridium spp. (30). All patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. All but 12 (5%) patients recovered. These data illustrate the importance of Bacteroides spp. in infections in children.
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Value of cultures of tissue samples taken at operation for lower intestinal perforation.
AB  - Tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium sp.). To determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients), treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. Attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. On average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. The common organisms were as expected: Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium sp. Although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity of Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.
TI  - The acute phase of experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - 1. The influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain CL of Trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic CFW (LOB) mice monoassociated with Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp or Clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. Significantly earlier parasitemia peak and mortality were observed in Bacteroides fragilis- and Clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). More precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in Peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. The extent of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, B. fragilis-associated, Clostridium-associated, and Peptostreptococcus-associated animals. The levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, Peptostreptococcus-associated, Clostridium-associated, and B. fragilis-associated mice. 4. These results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with T. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. This suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with T. cruzi.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - [Influence of cefodizime via intravenous bolus injection on human fecal flora].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was given to 8 healthy male volunteers with ages 23-28 years (mean: 24 years) and body weights 54-73 kg (mean: 64 kg). 4 volunteers received 2 g b.i.d., intravenous infusion for 5 days, and 4 volunteers had 4 g b.i.d. for the same duration. We studied changes in bacterial flora and drug levels in feces, as well as changes in susceptibility of isolated microbes to CDZM, cefmetazole, cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone. Adverse drug reactions and changes in laboratory findings were also investigated. The following results were obtained. 1. In fecal flora for the 2 g b.i.d. group, on day 3 of treatment Enterobacteriaceae were identified in only 2 of the 4 cases. Individual microbe counts decreased or fell below detection limit (10(2) cells/g) on day 3 of treatment. Colony forming units (CFUs) of Enterobacteriaceae on day 5 of treatment were similar to those on day 3. After the end of treatment, its CFUs increased. The mean CFU of Enterobacteriaceae on day 10 after the end of treatment increased to about the same level as before dosing. However, some microbes did not revert to pretreatment levels. Of other Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas sp. increased in one case transiently on day 3 of treatment. After day 3 of treatment, its CFU decreased. Gram-positive microbes showed various changes. Mean CFU of yeast like organism (YLO) increased between day 3 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment and its mean CFU decreased on day 10 after the treatment. As for anaerobes, CFUs of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms and overall anaerobes showed no distinctive changes. Clostridium difficile were detected in two cases. In one case, C. difficile was noted at levels between 1.1 X 10(3) cells/g and 2.0 X 10(6) cells/g at the following sampling times: days 1 and 3 of treatment and days 3, 5, 10 and 20 after the end of treatment. In other case, it was noted at levels of 1.8 X 10(5) cells/g on day 20 after the end of treatment. D-1 toxin was detected in one case before dosing, and in three cases (the concentration of D-1 toxin was 250 ng/g or 500 ng/g) on day after treatment. Enterobacteriaceae in fecal flora of 4 cases given 4 g b.i.d. frequently decreased or fell below detection limit on days 3 and 5 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - Accuracy and reproducibility of the 4-hour ATB 32A method for anaerobe identification.
AB  - The ATB 32A system (API System SA, La Balme les Grottes, Montalieu-Vercieu, France) was evaluated for use in the identification of 214 anaerobes. Organisms included 73 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 24 Bacteroides spp., 10 fusobacteria, 43 clostridia, 28 cocci, and 36 gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. With the concomitant use of Gram stain, pigmentation, catalase testing, and aerobic growth, the ATB 32A system correctly identified 97% of the B. fragilis group isolates, 88% of Bacteroides spp., 50% of fusobacteria, 74% of clostridia, 100% of cocci, and 86% of the gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Overall, 188 strains (88%) were correctly identified, with 18 (8%) requiring extra tests, other than the four mentioned above, for correct identification. Eight strains were misidentified, including one Bacteroides sp., three fusobacteria, one Clostridium sp., and three gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Reproducibility was very good, with 12 of 14 strains (86%) tested in triplicate yielding identical correct results on each of three occasions and 2 strains (14%) yielding identical correct results on two occasions. There was a low-probability identification (including the correct species) on the third testing. The ATB 32A system represents a worthwhile advance in systems used for the identification of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  - In a group of 600 patients treated in the Metropolitan Dermatological Hospital in Warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. In 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms was obtained. Coagulase-positive staphylococci (St. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter sp and E. coli) prevailed. In 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. In the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes exclusively was noted. Pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. In the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. Of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides sp, and Bacteroides fragilis. Among pathogenic anerobic cocci Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were most frequent. In 2 cases spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens) were obtained. Forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Comparative study of cefotetan and cefoxitin in the treatment of intra-abdominal  infections.
AB  - One hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of 1 to 2 gm cefotetan every 12 hours with those of 1 to 2 gm cefoxitin every 6 hours in patients with intra-abdominal infections. Most of the infections were community acquired, were associated with gastrointestinal tract perforation, and were caused by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The median duration of therapy was 6 days for each group. The clinical response rate for the 95 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group was 98%, and that for the 43 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group was 95%. Bacteriologically, 97% of the 58 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 89% of the 27 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; two patients in the cefotetan group and three in the cefoxitin group were considered bacteriologic failures. Cefotetan was as effective as cefoxitin in eradicating Bacteroides fragilis and other species of Bacteroides, Clostridium sp., and gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions for cefotetan (27%) was not statistically different from that for cefoxitin (17%). No clinically significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in changes in the results of clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment; a decrease in hematocrit among the cefotetan group was statistically greater (p = 0.04) than that for the cefoxitin group, and a decrease in serum creatinine level for the cefoxitin group was greater than that for the cefotetan group (p = 0.02). Cefotetan may represent an effective, safe, and cost-saving alternative to cefoxitin for the prompt treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Studies evaluating the in vitro and in vivo synergistic potential of combined antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria are reviewed. Most studies evaluated therapy against Bacteroides sp. (mostly Bacteroides fragilis group). The combinations found to be most effective against B. fragilis were between metronidazole and clindamycin, spiramycin or gentamicin and between clindamycin and aminoglycosides. Against Bacteroides melaninogenicus the effective combinations were penicillin or clindamycin plus gentamicin and metronidazole and spiramycin or gentamicin. Occasional synergy was observed against Clostridium sp. and anaerobic cocci with clindamycin and gentamicin. Synergistic combinations have the potential of clinical use in serious anaerobic infections.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - Etiological agent and primary source of infection in 42 cases of focal intracranial suppuration.
AB  - The microbiological findings for 42 patients with focal intracranial suppuration  were analyzed and correlated with the different sources of primary infection. Streptococcus spp. were identified in focal intracranial suppuration of all origins except postcraniotomy. Microaerophilic streptococci were important in cases secondary to respiratory tract infection and in those of unknown origin. Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus spp., and Bacteroides fragilis were the organisms most commonly found in polymicrobial otogenic abscesses. Clostridium sp. was the main microorganism implicated in postcraniotomy suppurations.
TI  - Anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - Twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. The etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). Seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. The predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (21), Fusobacterium sp. (8), Streptococcus sp. (5) and Clostridium sp. (4). The organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. Ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. These included all isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis (4) and of Staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 Bacteroides oralis. The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - [In vitro activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on anaerobic bacteria. Comparison with amoxicillin, lamoxactam and metronidazole].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the combination amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AAC) (2/1 w/w) on 84 strains of obligate anaerobes were measured by the agar diffusion method and compared to those of amoxicillin (AMO), lamoxactam (LAM) and metronidazole (MET). For the 47 Bacteroides fragilis strains tested, the mode MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml with AAC, 1-2 with MET, 0.5-1 with LAM and 8-16 with AMO. A similar range of activity was found on the 16 other strains of Bacteroides sp.. AAC and AMO have a comparable activity on Clostridium perfringens (mode MIC 0.016-0.032 microgram/ml), superior to that of LAM (mode MIC 0.125) and MET (mode MIC 0.5). AAC and AMO have an almost identical activity on Peptococci and Peptostreptococci, the MIC for both drugs being less than 0.125 microgram/ml. A similar activity was found for LAM and MET.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of niridazole. II. Effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. First, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole is completely ineffective. There exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. The in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. Second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. Extremely low MIC values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. Propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are also relatively resistant to niridazole.
TI  - Piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  - Piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing S. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis. Piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella sp and Pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. Like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. The primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. Piperacillin has been approved for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. As with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. The usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. It is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. Less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. Overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. Evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Methane and hydrogen production by human intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The gas above liquid cultures of a variety of human intestinal anaerobic bacteria was sampled and analysed by headspace gas chromatography. Hydrogen production was greatest with strains of the genus Clostridium, intermediate with anaerobic cocci and least with Bacteroides sp. Very few strains produced methane although small amounts were detected with one strain of B. thetaiotaomicron, C. perfringens and C. histolyticum. There may be a relationship between these anaerobic bacteria and several gastrointestinal disorders in which there is a build up of hydrogen or methane in the intestines.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis of the aged.
AB  - Bacteriological examination was performed on bile from 23 patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis. Of 23 bile cultures, 15 yielded aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and 8 yielded aerobic bacteria only. No specimen grew anaerobic bacteria only. A total of 20 cultures yielded a polymicrobial flora, and 3 cultures grew one single aerobic bacterium. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., enterococci, Bacteroids fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens were the predominant bacterial flora in bile of these patients. Bacteremia was documented in 10 of the 12 patients cultured. All bacteremias involved aerobic bacteria and were polymicrobial in three patients. The frequent presence of anaerobes in bile of patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis suggests that antimicrobial therapy should provide adequate coverage for anaerobic bacteria and enteric organisms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
AB  - Cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 28 patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. All specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Bacterial growth was present in specimens of 24 of the 28 patients. A total of 74 bacterial isolates were present (40 aerobes and 34 anaerobes). Aerobes alone were isolated from 8 (33%) of culture positive patients, 4 patients (26.7%) yielded only anaerobes, and 12 (50%) had both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Fifty isolates (27 aerobes and 23 aerobes) were present in a concentration greater than 10(6) CFU/gm. The most commonly isolated aerobic organisms were P. aeruginosa (9), Proteus sp. (7), K. pneumoniae (5), S. aureus (5), and E. coli (4). The anaerobic bacteria most commonly isolated were gram-positive anaerobic cocci (12), Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 B. fragilis group), Clostridium sp. (3), and Bifidobacterium sp. (3). The above findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 Bacteroides sp (11 in the B fragilis group); four anaerobic Gram-positive cocci; four Clostridium sp; four Propionibacterium acnes; and three Fusobacterium sp. No aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. The gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to Bacteroides organisms, four to Clostridium sp, and one to F nucleatum. The ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to Peptococcus sp and two to Fusobacterium sp. Five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by B fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by P acnes. The average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). The early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.
TI  - Bacterial studies of peritoneal cavity and postoperative surgical wound drainage  following perforated appendix in children.
AB  - This study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. Additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. Bacterial growth occurred in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. There were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). The predominant isolates were: E. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); Group D streptococcus (12 specimens); and P. aeruginosa (9 specimens). There were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). The predominant isolates were: 157 Bacteroides spp. (including 92 B. fragilis group and 26 B. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 Peptococcus sp.; 29 Peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 Fusobactenium sp.; and 16 Clostridium sp. B. fragilis and Peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. Beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. These included all isolates of B. fragilis and six of the 23 Bacteroides sp. Forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. The predominant organisms were: B. fragilis (8 specimens); E. coli (6 specimens); Peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of P. aeruginosa and Peptococcus sp. Most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. Aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 B fragilis group and seven B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (15), Fusobacterium sp (six), and Clostridium sp (three). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus morganii (two of each). Five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. Incision and drainage were performed on all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from pilonidal abscesses in 25 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 76 isolates (63 anaerobic and 13 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, accounting for 2.52 anaerobes and 0.52 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms were recovered from all the specimens, and in eight cases (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (36 isolates, including ten B fragilis group and ten B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (16). Fusobacterium sp (five), and Clostridium sp (four). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli (four) and group D streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Proteus sp (two of each). We believe this study is the first to demonstrate the mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscesses in children.
TI  - Comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar diffusion tests. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. Saccharolytic Bacteroides strains (39 B. fragilis, 6 B. thetaiotaomicron, 4 B. vulgatus) showed broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and MICs of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees C. With strains of B. oralis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, B. corrodens, Veillonella sp. and Megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution MICs were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Eubacterium sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. had broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas Peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. With the great majority of strains tested, MICs were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. Clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. Several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and MIC. With gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution MIC and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for Peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for P. acnes). When calculating the regression lines for agar dilution MICs and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for Peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for P. acnes). With B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution MICs and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
TI  - [Susceptibility to Thiamphenicol and Chloramphenicol of Anaerobic Bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, With chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 Bacteroides fragilis, 13 B. thetaiotaomicron, 14 B. oralis, 16 Sphaerophorus varius etc.) had MIC values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. Very similar results (MIC, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. In concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. Strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (MIC, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to B. fragilis or other Bacteroides species. Members of the Fusobacterium and Sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. With both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (P. acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. Of 37 Clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Only one strain each of C. perfringens and Clostridium sp. had an MIC of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. Accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. A standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 Bacteroidaceae, 18 Peptococcaceae and 20 C, (P.) acnes strains. Only a poor correlation was observed between MIC and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. Therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. Thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - A rapid glutamic decarboxylase test for identification of bacteria.
AB  - A simple rapid glutamic decarboxylase test is described. This test was found useful in the identification of Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Providencia alcalifaciens, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel and the rate of gas flow. Cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus sp. and Propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. All cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours then incubated in a GasPak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared to incubation only in the GasPak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
TI  - The reduction of N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  - The role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of N-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. This reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. These include cultures of Clostridium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus productus I, and Bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. In contrast, cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. The reduction of N-OH-AABP is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. On a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing N-OH-AABP than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing N-OH-AABP than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. The products of the metabolism of N-OH-AABP have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. Glucuronide conjugates of N-OH-AABP are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. These results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing N-OH-AABP, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.
TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO(2) levels greater than 0.5%. Species that were found to be strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., Clostridium haemolyticum, Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
