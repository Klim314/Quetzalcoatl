TI  == salivary iga subclasses and bacteria-reactive iga in patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the local salivary immunoglobulin a (iga) response in patients with aggressive periodontitis to oral microorganisms and its role for the pathogenesis has not been determined. this study investigated the hypothesis that aggressive periodontitis patients have impaired oral secretory immunity. our test group was  made-up of 19 aggressive periodontitis patients and 19 age- and gender-matched periodontally healthy controls. total iga, iga subclass 1, iga subclass 2 and iga reactive to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, treponema denticola atcc 35404 and candida albicans dsm 3454 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in whole unstimulated and stimulated saliva. a statistically  significantly lower concentration and secretion rate of total salivary iga (p < 0.01) and iga1 (p < 0.001) was found in the aggressive periodontitis group in resting and stimulated saliva. a decrease of iga2 (p < 0.05) was seen in resting  saliva. although only minor differences were detected in the concentration and secretion of bacteria-reactive iga in both groups, the proportion of bacteria-reactive iga from the total iga was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the aggressive periodontitis group in all three microorganisms tested. our results indicate an inhibition of total secretory iga. in particular an iga subclass 1-specific decrease in aggressive periodontitis was noted, while the bacteria-reactive humoral immune system in saliva was activated. the role of the  decrease of iga1 immunoglobulins in aggressive periodontitis with respect to susceptibility for periodontal diseases has to be elucidated.
