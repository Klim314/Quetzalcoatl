TI  == the activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  == p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and std activity. mic determinations  were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on haemophilus ducreyi, neisseria gonorrheae, candida albicans, bacillus subtilus, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and psuedomanas aeruginosa. an in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microm (17,9 microg/ml) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living  cells.
