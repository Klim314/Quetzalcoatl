TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - The performance of 4 different supplements and 5 blood culture bottles types in detection of bacteria and Candida spp. in simulated sterile body fluid cultures.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the performance of 4 supplements: horse blood, fastidious organisms supplement (FOS), haemin isovitalex albumine (HIA), and brain heart infusion-haemin isovitalex albumine (BHI-HIA) and 5 blood culture bottles: Bactec Mycosis IC/F, Plus Aerobic/F, Peds Plus/F from the Bactec 9240 system, and BacT/Alert FA and BacT/Alert PF from the BacT/Alert 3D system, in detection of bacteria and Candida spp. in simulated sterile body fluids other than blood models. In total, 8 reference strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Candida albicans, and Candida parapsilosis) and 11 clinical bacteria and yeast isolates (6 isolates from cerebrospinal fluid and 5 isolates from blood) were included in this study. Horse blood, FOS, and HIA were significantly better than no supplements (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0002, and P = 0.05, respectively) in detection of bacteria. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between BHI-HIA and bottles without any supplements. Sixty bottles analyzed of which 59 (98.33%) bottles with horse blood, 53 (88.33%) with FOS, 45 (75.00%) with HIA, and 43 (71.67%) with BHI-HIA signaled positive. The positivity rates with horse blood were significantly higher than with HIA and BHI-HIA (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Similarly, the blood culture bottles with horse blood had shorter time to detection (TTD) compared to bottles with FOS and HIA (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). When yeasts were analyzed, almost all (124/125) blood culture bottles with Candida spp. signaled positive even in the absence of supplements. Bactec Mycosis IC/F had significantly shorter TTD compared to Bactec Peds Plus/F, Bactec Plus Aerobic/F, BacT/Alert FA, and BacT/Alert PF bottles in detection of Candida spp. (P < 0.005, P < 0.05, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). The present study showed that horse blood was the most effective supplement in growth of bacteria in the blood culture bottles that were analyzed in the study.
TI  - [Microbial structure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - Microbiological investigation of 124 patients with acute conjunctivitis which were treated in one of Tbilisi policlinics in 2010-12 years, was performed; microbial structure containing 124 microbial strains of different species was detected. Namely, following species of microorganisms were isolated: S. aureus - 35 strains (28,2%), Str. pneumoniae - 10 strains (8,1%), S. epidermidis - 6 strains (4,8%), Ps. aeruginosa - 24 strains (19,4%), Moraxella catarrhalis - 21 strains (16,9%), Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegipticus - 17 strains (13,7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae - 11 strains (8,9%). Identification of microorganisms was performed using classic methods of microbiological explorations and test systems API (bio Meriux). Study of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tobramicin, norfoloxacin, moxifloxacin) containing in eye drops, was performed by diffusion in agar. High level of resistance to this antibiotic was found. As a result it is recommended to perform microbiological investigation in each case of acute conjunctivitis, to receive rational treatment.
TI  - [Comparison of culture and real-time PCR methods in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. This study was aimed to compare the detection rate of S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. A total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. The samples were inoculated and incubated in BACTEC Ped Plus blood culture bottles and BACTEC 9120 system (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. For the molecular diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and HIB capsule region, respectively were amplified by Rt-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. In addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans) were also isolated. On the other hand H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with Rt-PCR, respectively. There was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae with Rt-PCR compared to culture methods. When culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of Rt-PCR in the detection of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. As a result, Rt-PCR was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.
TI  - Microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. Since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. METHODS: A total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the United States with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. Species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards. RESULTS: The most prevalent species was Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, the Streptococcus mitis group, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. One species identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was Dolosigranulum pigrum. Ampicillin resistance was common among H. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among S. pneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. The latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, D. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. The topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage for empiric treatment of ocular infections.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - [Determination of causative agents in ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments--multicenter study of causative agents and drug sensitivity of ocular infection by the Japanese Association for Ocular Infection part I].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the causative agents of ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments due to selected criteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 22, 2007 and August 25, 2008, 890 bacterial strains were collected from 476 patients in 18 facilities nationwide participating in the Drug Sensitivity for Ocular Infection Study Group. Usual aerobic and anaerobic cultures, enrichment cultures, smears, and measurements of bacterial quantity were performed and the determination of causative agents was made from the results of smears and culture, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells and bacterial quantity. The selection was divided into two categories, causative agents and presumed causative agents. Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were distinctively considered as specified bacteria. RESULTS: Among 890 strains, 18.8% were determined to be causative agents, and 15.1% were determined to be presumed causative agents. Among the bacteria detected in normal flora, 2.0% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.6% of Propionibacterium acnes, and 38.3% of Corynebacterium spp. were determined to be causative agents. CONCLUSION: To determine the causative agents, the results of smears and bacterial quantity should be considered together with culture results. Bacteria constituting normal flora have the potential of becoming causative agents.
TI  - Integrated analysis of three bacterial conjunctivitis trials of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%: etiology of bacterial conjunctivitis and antibacterial susceptibility profile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper is to report on the bacterial species isolated from patients with bacterial conjunctivitis participating in three clinical trials of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, and their in vitro antibacterial susceptibility profiles. METHODS: Microbial data from three clinical studies, conducted at multiple clinical sites in the US and Asia were integrated. Species were identified at a central laboratory, and minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for various antibiotics, including beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. RESULTS: A total of 1324 bacterial pathogens representing more than 70 species were isolated. The most common species were Haemophilus influenzae (26.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.4%). H. influenzae was most frequently isolated among patients aged 1-18 years, while S. aureus was most prevalent among those >65 years. Drug resistance was prevalent: Of H. influenzae isolates, 25.3% were beta-lactamase positive and 27.2% of S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-intermediate/ resistant; of S. aureus isolates, 13.7% were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and of these, 65.4% were ciprofloxacin-resistant, while 45.9% of S. epidermidis isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRSE), and, of these, 47.1% were ciprofloxacin-resistant. Besifloxacin was more potent than comparator fluoroquinolones overall, and particularly against Gram-positive bacteria. Against ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA and MRSE, besifloxacin was four-fold to >/= 128-fold more potent than other fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: While the pathogen distribution in bacterial conjunctivitis has not changed, drug resistance is increasing. Patient age and local antibiotic resistance trends should be considered in the treatment of this ocular infection. Besifloxacin showed broad-spectrum in vitro activity and was particularly potent against multidrug-resistant staphylococcal isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Limitations of current antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.
AB  - Bacterial conjunctivitis is a common ocular infection that is generally treated empirically with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The more common pathogens causing bacterial conjunctivitis include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Moraxella species. Several antibiotics traditionally used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis are no longer widely prescribed because of increased bacterial resistance and/or safety concerns. The introduction of the fluoroquinolone class of anti-infectives offered effective and better tolerated treatment options. Nonetheless, successful therapy for bacterial conjunctivitis continues to be limited by several factors. A primary concern is the development of bacterial resistance that may be impacted not only by widespread antibiotic use but also by antibacterial pharmacokinetics, such as maintenance of insufficient bactericidal concentrations at the site of infection. In addition, poor adherence to prescribed regimens that require frequent administration, along with undesirable adverse events, affects the development of bacterial resistance and the success of treatment regimens. This article reviews current antibacterial agents used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, factors that limit their successful use in treatment, and options for future development of more effective topical ophthalmic anti-infective agents.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: Seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. RESULTS: Of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. Among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). The most common gram-negative organisms were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. To the gram-negative organisms, the most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to Meropenem, Imipenem and Amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium identified.
TI  - Use of quantitative broad-based polymerase chain reaction for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to define the limit of detection (LOD), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. METHODS: A PCR algorithm consisting of initial broad-based detection of Eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or Gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. The 16S rRNA gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. Pathogen-specific probes were designed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. The LOD and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. A total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clinical samples obtained from the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. RESULTS: The LOD of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. Time to detection was 3 hours. In clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or Gram-typing probes. Adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% CI = 65.3% to 98.6%). The universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. CONCLUSIONS: A broad-based multiprobe PCR assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. Findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Bacteriology of occluded nasolacrimal ducts in infants].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Connatal lacrimal duct stenosis (cLDO) commonly causes purulent bacterial dacyrocystitis. The recommended treatment of choice is up to the sixth month of life a conservative antimicrobiological therapy. After the sixth month lacrimal duct irrigation with silicone tube intubation remains the gold standard. Our purpose was to analyse the current bacterial spectrum in cLDO and to compile a bacterial resistogram in order to specify antimicrobiological therapy. METHODS: 66 samples from the lacrimal duct of 6- to 16-month-old children (41 female, 25 male) were obtained by collecting the refluxing liquids with cotton wool swabs after irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system with sterile saline during lacrimal duct surgery. Cultures were incubated aerobically and anaerobically and the infectious agents were isolated. Sensitivity testing was performed for each isolate, testing 8 different commonly used local antibiotics. Data were statistically analysed using SPSS. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in cLDO in 97 %, showing co-colonisation in 87 % with up to five bacterial strains. Gram-positive bacteria were seen in 72 % of the isolates in cLDO with Streptococcus pneumoniae (31 %) being the most abundant strain, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (13 %) and S. epidermidis (13 %). In 85 % of the samples at least one Gram-negative rod was present, most often Branhamella (12 %), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (11 %). Sensitivity testing revealed chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin to be the most effective drugs in cLDO, whereas erythromycin and gentamycin turned out to be insufficient in treating cLDO. CONCLUSION: Bacterial colonisation plays a crucial role in cLDO, showing a positive culture in 97 % with frequent co-colonisation of several bacterial strains (often in combination with at least one Gram-negative strain). The sampling of a microbiological probe of the lacrimal duct is recommended at least in therapy-refractory cases. Current bacteria in cLDO can be effectively treated with chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin. The commonly used antibiotics erythromycin and gentamicin are inappropriate as monotherapeutics.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of besifloxacin against staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that was recently approved for topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. The compound was shown to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including isolates resistant to other antibacterials. Here, the bactericidal activity of besifloxacin was evaluated against the most common bacterial conjunctivitis pathogens. METHODS: MIC, MBC and time-kill experiments with besifloxacin and comparators were performed according to CLSI guidelines. Quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were sequenced using standard PCR-based techniques. RESULTS: MIC and MBC data indicated that besifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against Staphylococcus aureus (n = 30), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 15) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 35), while all fluoroquinolones were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (n = 40). Besifloxacin MBC:MIC ratios were < or = 4 for 97.5% of all isolates tested (n = 120). All fluoroquinolones tested, as well as tobramycin, were bactericidal, while azithromycin was bactericidal against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, but bacteriostatic against the staphylococci. Time-kill assays with all four species showed that besifloxacin caused > or = 1000-fold killing within 2 h for 11 of 12 isolates. Only one isolate treated with moxifloxacin and three ciprofloxacin-treated isolates achieved the same level of bactericidal activity under the same conditions. Unlike the comparator fluoroquinolones, besifloxacin maintained a high potency and bactericidal activity even against strains that contained multiple mutations in the genes encoding DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, besifloxacin demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against the four major human pathogens tested here, including isolates that showed in vitro resistance to other fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, macrolides or aminoglycosides.
TI  - Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6%.
AB  - Besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that, like other fluoroquinolones, acts by inhibiting the essential bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topical besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% is indicated for use in patients with bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible bacteria. Besifloxacin had in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria that commonly cause ocular infections (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae), including drug-resistant strains. In two randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered at the recommended dose for 5 days in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis was significantly (p < 0.01) more effective than vehicle in terms of clinical resolution and microbial eradication rates (coprimary endpoints) at study visit two (day 5+/-1) or three (day 8 or 9) [primary timepoints]. Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was noninferior to moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis with regard to clinical resolution (58.3% vs 59.4%) and microbial eradication (93.3% vs 91.1%) rates on day 5 +/- 1 of treatment (coprimary endpoints) in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial; both drugs were administered at a dosage of one drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily for 5 days. Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with most adverse events being mild in severity. The tolerability profile of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was similar to that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% compared with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% for treating bacterial conjunctivitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and antimicrobial efficacy of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% with that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled, noninferiority study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 1 year of age or older with clinical manifestations of bacterial conjunctivitis. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to either besifloxacin suspension or moxifloxacin solution, instilled in the infected eye(s) 3 times daily for 5 days, and participated in study visits on days 1, 5 (+/-1 day), and 8 (+1 day). Assessments included clinical evaluation of signs and symptoms, visual acuity, biomicroscopy, and culture of the infected eye(s) at each visit, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy on days 1 and 8. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy end points were clinical resolution and microbial eradication of baseline bacterial infection on day 5 in patients with culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis. Secondary end points included clinical resolution and microbial eradication on day 8, individual clinical outcomes, microbial and clinical outcomes by bacterial species, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 1161 patients (533 with culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis) were randomized. Based on the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference, besifloxacin was noninferior to moxifloxacin for clinical resolution on day 5 (58.3% vs. 59.4%, respectively; 95% CI, -9.48 to 7.29) and day 8 (84.5% vs. 84.0%, respectively, 95% CI, -5.6% to 6.75%) and for microbial eradication on day 5 (93.3% vs. 91.1%, respectively, 95% CI, -2.44 to 6.74) and day 8 (87.3% vs. 84.7%; 95% CI, -3.32 to 8.53). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups for either efficacy end points on days 5 or 8 (P>0.05). Besifloxacin and moxifloxacin were well tolerated. The cumulative frequency of ocular adverse events was similar between treatments (12% and 14% with besifloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively). However, eye irritation occurred more often in moxifloxacin-treated eyes (0.3% for besifloxacin vs. 1.4% for moxifloxacin; P = 0.0201). CONCLUSIONS: Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension was non inferior to moxifloxacin ophthalmic suspension and provided similar safety and efficacy (clinical and microbiological) outcomes when used for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  - Ocular pharmacokinetics of besifloxacin following topical administration to rabbits, monkeys, and humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies were conducted to evaluate the ocular penetration and systemic exposure to besifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, following topical ocular administration to animals and humans. METHODS: Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension (0.6%) was administered as a topical ocular instillation to pigmented rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and human subjects. At predetermined intervals after dosing, samples of ocular tissues and plasma were collected and analyzed for besifloxacin levels using HPLC/MS/MS methods. RESULTS: Besifloxacin demonstrated good ocular penetration in rabbits and monkeys, with rapid absorption and sustained concentrations observed in anterior ocular tissues through 24 h after a single administration. Maximum besifloxacin concentrations in conjunctiva, cornea, and aqueous humor of monkeys were 6.43 microg/g, 2.10 microg/g, and 0.796 microg/mL, respectively, after a single topical dose, and concentrations declined in these tissues with an apparent half-life of 5-14 h. Following a single topical ocular administration to humans, the maximum besifloxacin concentration in tears was 610 microg/g with concentrations decreasing to approximately 1.6 microg/g at 24 h. The resulting pharmacokinetic parameters for besifloxacin in human tears were evaluated relative to the MIC(90) values (microg/mL) for besifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.125), Staphylococcus aureus (0.25), Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.5), and Haemophilus influenzae (0.06). Following a single topical administration, the C(max)/MIC(90) ratios for besifloxacin in human tears were > or =1,220, and the AUC((0-24))/MIC(90) ratios were > or =2,500 for these relevant ocular pathogens. Following repeated 3-times daily (TID) topical ocular administration to human subjects with clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis, maximum besifloxacin concentrations in plasma were less than 0.5 ng/mL, on average. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of the current investigation provide a PK/PD-based rationale that supports the use of besifloxacin for the safe and effective treatment of ocular infections.
TI  - [An eight-year review of sensitivity to antimicrobials against isolated microorganisms from ocular infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain data beneficial for future treatment by observing the circumstances relating to microorganisms isolated in external ocular infections and drug sensitivity, along with changes in drug-resistant bacteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For an eight-year period from April 1998 to March 2006, the cultivation and identification of secretions from conjunctival sac and drug sensitivity tests were conducted at JA Gifu Koseiren Chuno General Hospital involving 3,876 patients (1,809 males and 2,067 females; average age: 44.2 +/- 29.3 years old, ranging from 0-99 years old) diagnosed with external ocular infections by the Department of Ophthalmology. Sensitivity test results were evaluated based on the US CLSI standards. RESULTS: Of the 5,002 samples, 3,447 tested positive for cultures (isolation rate: 68.9%). A total of 4,537 strains were isolated. In descending order, the microorganisms isolated were 1,706 strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS), including Staphylococcus epidermidis (37.6%), 936 strains of Corynebacterium spp. (20.6%), 635 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), 412 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), and 246 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.4%). CNS, Corynebacterium and S. aureus were isolated in relatively large numbers in patients of all ages. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were common in children six and under and from winter to spring. At the sametime, resistant bacteria (PRSP or PISP: 166 strains; 2000 onward, BLNAR: 192 strains; and BLPACR: 6 strains) were detected more frequently than sensitive bacteria. H. influenzae was hypersensitive to cefotaxime (CTX) and levofloxacin. Almost no toleration of CTX was observed in S. pneumoniae. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: There are distinctions in the isolated bacteria according to age and season, and the use of drugs that are appropriate to the antibiograms of each facility should be considered.
TI  - Rate of bacterial eradication by ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibacterial activity of ophthalmic fourth-generation fluoroquinolones has traditionally been evaluated by comparing only their active ingredients, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. However, ophthalmic formulations of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones differ in terms of the inclusion of preservatives. While gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3% (Zymar; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) contains 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (BAK), moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% (Vigamox; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA) is preservative-free. Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of BAK dramatically affects the antibacterial activity of the ophthalmic formulation of gatifloxacin. This study was designed to compare the kill rates of ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones against isolates of common ocular bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Approximately 5.6 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of Haemophilus influenzae (n=1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), Staphylococcus aureus (n=2), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n=4), methicillinresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (n=4), and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. epidermidis (n=1) were incubated with ophthalmic solutions of either gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. Viable bacteria were quantified at specific time points up to 60 minutes. RESULTS: Gatifloxacin 0.3% completely eradicated H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae in 5 minutes, one of two S. aureus isolates in 15 minutes, and the other S. aureus isolate in 60 minutes. Gatifloxacin 0.3% completely killed all MRSA, MRSE, and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. epidermidis isolates in 15 minutes. Moxifloxacin 0.5% completely eradicated Strep. pneumoniae and one of four MRSA isolates in 60 minutes. All other isolates incubated with moxifloxacin 0.5% retained viable bacteria ranging from 1.8 to 4.4 log(10) CFU/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The ophthalmic solution of gatifloxacin 0.3% eradicated bacteria that frequently cause postoperative ocular infections substantially faster than did the ophthalmic solution of moxifloxacin 0.5%.
TI  - Clinicobacteriological study of chronic dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - Chronic dacryocystitis is the inflammation of lacrimal sac, frequently caused by  bacteria. Obstruction of nasolacrimal duct converts the lacrimal sac a reservoir of infection. It is a constant threat to cornea and orbital soft tissue. Moreover, it causes social embarrassment due to chronic watering from the eye. This study was conducted to find out the current clinicobacteriological profile of chronic dacryocystitis in adults. A total of 56 adult patients were selected from ophthalmology OPD. Detail history and clinical examinations were carried out. All patients underwent either dacryocystorhinostomy or dacryocystectomy. A part of the sac was collected for culture and sensitivity. This study revealed that chronic dacryocystitis is more common in females and left eye is more frequently involved than right eye. It is common among lower socioeconomic strata with habit of pond-bathing. Some form of nasal pathology like hypertrophied inferior turbinate, deviated nasal septum, nasal polyp and allergic rhinitis werefound in 19.6% of the patients. Complications of chronic dacryocystitis like conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, acute on chronic dacryocystitis, lacrimal abscess and fistula were seen in 25.0% of these patients; 53.6% of the culture samples were positive for bacterial growth. Gram-positive organisms were most common isolate. Unlike other studies, Staphylococcus aureus (40.0%) was found to be most common Gram-positive organism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.0%) and Steptococcus pneumoniae (10.0%). Among the Gram-negative organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%) was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6.6%). Antibiotic sensitivity tests were done. Most of the organisms were resistant to penicillin. Chloramphenicol was effective against most of the Gram-positive organisms. Aminoglycosides, tobramycin in particular, was effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Effect of lidocaine gel on povidone-iodine antisepsis and microbial survival.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the use of lidocaine gel prior to povidone-iodine antisepsis is associated with increased microbial survival. SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, Madigan Army Medical Center, Fort Lewis, Washington, USA. METHODS: A standardized suspension of Staphylococcus epidermidis was used to inoculate 5 blood agar plates that served as a control. A second group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then lidocaine gel was applied to the plates. A third group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, lidocaine gel was applied, and then povidone-iodine 5% was applied and allowed to cover the plates. A fourth group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then povidone-iodine 5% was allowed to cover the plates. Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenza were tested in a similar fashion. Microbial growth was evaluated after 24 hours. RESULTS: The number of colony forming units (CFUs) was similar in the control group and the S epidermidis, S aureus, and P aeruginosa lidocaine only and lidocaine with povidone-iodine groups. In these groups, each plate grew between 200 CFUs and 300 CFUs. In the Haemophilus influenza series, the lidocaine with povidone-iodine group had fewer CFUs than the control group. In all 4 series, the povidone-iodine only group had the least amount of CFUs, ranging from 0 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: The use of lidocaine gel before application of povidone-iodine 5% resulted in decreased effectiveness of antisepsis and increased microbial survivability. The increase in microbial survivability may increase the risk for postoperative infection in ocular surgery performed under topical anesthesia.
TI  - Ventriculogallbladder shunts in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECT: The authors report a clinical protocol for the application of ventriculogallbladder (VGB) shunts in children who may be unable to maintain or receive ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent placement of VGB shunts as an alternative to VP shunt therapy for the following reasons: malfunction of the VP shunt due to suspected failure of the peritoneum to absorb cerebrospinal fluid (17 cases) and multiple intraabdominal general surgical procedures (1 case). The patients ranged in age from 4 months to 17 years (mean 6.5 +/- 6.1 years [standard deviation {SD}]). All patients underwent preoperative imaging of the gall-bladder either by ultrasonography or computed tomography scanning. A team consisting of a pediatric neurological surgeon and a pediatric general surgeon performed all operative procedures. The procedures were conducted by open laparotomy to precisely place the appropriate length of distal catheter and to anchor it to the gallbladder wall. RESULTS: There were 2 early shunt malfunctions, both obstructions due to "sludge" (1 in the biliary duct and 1 in the common bile duct). A late-onset (5-year) malfunction occurred secondary to gallbladder stones. In all 3 cases of malfunction, the devices were successfully converted to VP shunts. In 1 patient a conversion to a VP shunt was chosen following a general surgical intervention. There were 2 shunt infections (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Haemophilus influenzae). These were successfully treated. Two patients underwent conversion to a VGB shunt on 2 occasions. Thirteen patients had functional VGB shunts at the time of their last follow-up assessment. The follow-up for these 13 patients ranged from 1 to 8 years (mean 2.1 +/- 2.0 years [SD]). CONCLUSIONS: Ventriculogallbladder shunts may be considered for the treatment of hydrocephalus in children when the peritoneal cavity cannot be used as a distal terminus.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - A critical review of oxazolidinones: an alternative or replacement for glycopeptides and streptogramins?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the available data on the oxazolidinones linezolid and eperezolid. DATA SELECTION: Published reports were obtained by searching MEDLINE for articles published between 1992 and 2000, inclusive. References of published papers were also obtained and reviewed. Abstracts from scientific proceedings were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Due to the limited data available regarding these agents, the criteria for study inclusion were not restrictive. DATA SYNTHESIS: The oxazolidinones (eg, linezolid) are a new antimicrobial class with a unique mechanism of action. They are active against resistant Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococccus epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). Linezolid is active against anaerobes and displays modest activity against fastidious Gram-negative pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, but is not active against Enterobacteriaceae. Linezolid is available both orally and parenterally, and has a bioavailability of 100%. Clinical trials comparing linezolid with standard therapy have demonstrated similar bacteriological and clinical cures rates to standard therapy in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated and complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and infections caused by MRSA and VRE. Adverse effects have been minor and infrequent; however, platelets should be monitored in patients who have received more than two weeks of linezolid therapy. It is expected that these agents will have a bright future due to their excellent spectrum of activity against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive organisms, such as MRSA, VRE and PRSP, and their excellent bioavailability. CONCLUSION: The oxazolidinones represent a new class of antimicrobials with a unique mechanism of action. They have excellent activity against susceptible and resistant Gram-positive organisms such as MRSA, methicillin-susceptible S epidermidis, VRE and PRSP, and a good adverse effect profile; they can be administered both intravenously and orally. Their potential use in Canada may be as an intravenous and oral alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins.
TI  - Comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. METHODS: MIC90s (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase III study and confirmed externally. RESULTS: The most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the phase III study were Haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), Propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). MIC90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. On the other hand, the MIC90 for H. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for S. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for S. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for S. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell disease in Africa: is pneumococcal prophylaxis justified?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. The reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in SS disease in Africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. METHODS: A study of blood cultures in 155 Ugandan children (165 episodes) with SS disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees C, attending the University Teaching Hospital in Kampala (Uganda, East Africa). RESULTS: Positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed Staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, Haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli and an unidentified Gram negative rod. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. CONCLUSION: The infrequent isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with SS disease in this study and in four other studies from Nigeria raises questions on a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. There are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. These data are necessary to determine its role in African children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial Africa.
TI  - PD-140248 (Parke-Davis & Co).
AB  - PD-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase II inhibitor under development by Parke-Davis and Co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. Although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in September 1999, the company confirmed that PD-140248 is still in active development [338530]. The compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being PD-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. PD-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S epidermidis), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E faecalis). An MIC90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. The (3R,1S) enantiomer, PD-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery between September 1 and December 31, 2003. Aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/mL, respectively. Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/mL, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (MIC(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. However, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h vitreous group for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. Moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. The pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous levels can be achieved after topical administration. Further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - Non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents decrease bacterial colonisation of contact lenses and prevent adhesion to human corneal epithelial cells.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylic acid, sodium diclofenac and ketorolac for inhibition of bacterial colonization of contact lenses (CL) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCE). METHODS: CLs pre-colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed overnight to NSAIDs and the number of viable bacteria on the CLs were calculated. Cytotoxicity of NSAIDs to HCE cells was evaluated with the MTT assay. Viable counts were used to measure the adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE cells in the presence of the least cytotoxic NSAID. RESULTS: All NSAIDs significantly decreased bacterial colonization of CLs in a dose-dependent manner. Salicylic acid (100 mM) completely inhibited colonisation of all species tested and was the least cytotoxic. Salicylic acid also prevented adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE (60% and 58% inhibition at 60 mM at 2 hours). CONCLUSIONS: Salicylic acid demonstrated potential as a compound for incorporation into anti-bacterial strategies to prevent bacterial contamination of contact lenses. This study highlighted the potential for NSAIDs as anti-bacterial agents and indicates that this class of compound should be investigated for other suitable candidates.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Chemical structure, conjugation, and cross-reactivity of Bacillus pumilus Sh18 cell wall polysaccharide.
AB  - Bacillus pumilus strain Sh18 cell wall polysaccharide (CWP), cross-reactive with  the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b, was purified and its chemical structure was elucidated using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, and sugar-specific degradation procedures. Two major structures, 1,5-poly(ribitol phosphate) and 1,3-poly(glycerol phosphate), with the latter partially substituted by 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-galactopyranose (13%) and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-glucopyranose (6%) on position O-2, were found. A minor component was established to be a polymer of -->3-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-glucopyranosyl)-1-->4-ribitol-1-OPO3-->. The ratios of the three components were 56, 34, and 10 mol%, respectively. The Sh18 CWP was covalently bound to carrier proteins, and the immunogenicity of the resulting conjugates was evaluated in mice. Two methods of conjugation were compared: (i) binding of 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate-activated hydroxyl groups of the CWP to adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH)-derivatized protein, and (ii) binding of the carbodiimide-activated terminal phosphate group of the CWP to ADH-derivatized protein. The conjugate-induced antibodies reacted in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the homologous polysaccharide and with a number of other bacterial polysaccharides containing ribitol and glycerol phosphates, including H. influenzae types a and b and strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MIC90 of MEPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. MEPM was active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). 2. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenems including MEPM were active against these ESBL strains. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - Reflections on shunt infection.
AB  - The placement and revision of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts remains a mainstay in the surgical treatment of hydrocephalus. While the North American infection rate averages nearly 8-10%, published infection rates for VP shunt infection below 1% have been reported. We retrospectively reviewed shunt operations by a single surgeon over 62 months to analyze the infection rate. In 62 months, we performed 526 shunt placements or revisions in patients up to 18 years of age. There were 7 shunt infections (1.33%). In 5 cases, the organism was Staphylococcus epidermidis, and a single shunt each was infected with Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. Each infection was treated with external ventriculostomy drainage and intravenous antibiotics. The new shunt was placed at a new incision site after at least 5 days of sterile spinal fluid cultures. The mean follow-up among these patients after shunt insertion was 25 months. VP shunting remains the most common operation for hydrocephalus. Infections are linked with seizures, higher future risks of shunt infection and malfunction, and reduced IQ and school performance. Our infection rate during 62 months was limited to 1.33%. Uniform surgical technique, limited hardware and skin edge manipulation and double gloving may be important factors in limiting shunt infections.
TI  - Treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. METHODS: Susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the E-test method. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. Aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. Experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. Three identical studies were conducted using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. After 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. The main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. RESULTS: In vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the MIC of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for P. aeruginosa. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a denuded epithelium. All serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. Experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the S. aureus model and a similar decrease in the S pneumoniae and P aeruginosa models. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. Clinical Relevance Trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.
TI  - Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. No change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. CONCLUSION: Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of AOMT.
TI  - [Etiological profile of bacterial meningitis in a small hospital]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic profile of cases of meningitis treated at a small hospital in Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, and to compare it to those reported for other communities.METHODS: a retrospective study was conducted on 103 patients admitted from January 1992 to July 1996 with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The clinical criteria for diagnosis were based on patient history and physical signs and symptoms, and the laboratory criteria were based on cerebrospinal fluid examination (aspect, cytology, biochemistry, Gram staining, culture and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) and blood culture.RESULTS: The etiologic agent was identified in 81.5% of cases: Haemophilus influenzae type b in 32%, Neisseria meningitides in 25.2%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8.7%, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis in 8.7%, and others agents in 6.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the cases of bacterial meningitis treated at the Santa Lydia Hospital of Ribeirao Preto are caused by the same agents detected in other places, with Haemophilus influenzae type b being the predominant one. The study also suggests that when many people are involved in the collection of material for laboratory tests, recovery of the agent may become difficult.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - [Bacterial examination of sinusitis using antral puncture and irrigation].
AB  - Aerobic bacterial examination for sinusitis was conducted using specimens from maxillary sinuses collected by antral puncture in 540 patients--284 men and 256 women aged 6-89 years--between May 1999 and April 2000. We obtained 528 strains of bacteria. Our results were as follows: 1. We obtained 303 pathogens from 540 patients. In acute sinusitis, the most frequently found was Streptococcus pneumoniae (30.4%), followed by Hemophilus influenzae (27.7%). In chronic cases, the most frequently found was Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.0%), followed by Hemophilus influenzae (15.1%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%). 2. We found an increase in bacteria resistant to multiple drugs, with 11.1% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates methicillin-resistant in acute sinusitis and 40% methicillin-resistant in chronic sinusitis, and that 30.6% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant. 3. Ciclacillin was effective against 64.7% of all pathogens isolated in this study, cefpodoxime proxetil effective against 6.5%, and cefixime effective against 2.4%. 4. In considering pathogens, we therefore choose antibiotics and make a maxillary aspiration puncture.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. METHODS: In all, 49 different isolates were studied. Each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. Plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 values, r=0.9. Gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 than Gram-positive bacteria. Group G streptococci (GGS) induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group A streptococci (GAS). Klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis. GGS induced higher levels of IL-6 than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and GAS. When the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. CONCLUSION: Species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.
TI  - Low frequency of bacteraemia during eye surgery obviates the need for endocarditis prophylaxis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of bacteraemia following eye surgery, and thereby evaluate the need for antibiotic cover during such procedures, in patients who are at risk for bacterial endocarditis. METHODS: This prospective study involved 50 consecutive patients undergoing extraocular surgery at the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. Local preparation of the surgical site in all patients included pre-operative instillation of 0.3% gentamicin and 3% povidone-iodine eye drops. Two eye swabs (one from the conjunctival sac and another from the eyelid margin) and two venous blood samples (one taken just before the procedure and the second 10 min into it) were collected and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Surgery-related bacteraemia was defined as a negative pre-operative blood culture followed by a positive intraoperative blood culture of the same bacterium identified in the positive eye swab. RESULTS: Only two patients (4%) demonstrated surgery-related bacteraemia: one caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis (following entropion correction) and the other by Haemophilus influenzae (following dacryocystorhinostomy). Four other patients had positive conjunctival swabs without bacteraemia, the causative organisms being Haemophilus influenzae in two, and Staphyloccus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one each. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic surgery is not associated with significant bacteraemia, and therefore does not mandate routine antibiotic cover in patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis. Stringent pre-operative preparation of the surgical site may suffice to minimise bacteraemia; however, this requires further study.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - [Bacteriologic evaluation of middle ear fluid during the course of secretory otitis media in children].
AB  - Fluid collected from tympanic cavity during operation from 43 children with O.M.S. was subjected to bacteriological examination. After the collection, each sample was immediately applied to Bactec Peds Plus/F liquid medium from Becton Dickinson. The number of samples, where each genus and species of bacteria were found, was determined, as well as the number of samples where every two genus coexisted; also the pH genes, in which each genus was found were calculated. Obtained results showed that 22 species of bacteria, belonging to 6 genus lived in the samples. The most commonly occurring genus were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Haemophilus; the most rare genus were Moraxella and Bacillus. The most common species were: Haemophilus influenzae (18.6% of samples), Staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.6%), Staphylococcus warneri (9.3%) and Streptococcus oralis (7.0%). Streptococcus coexisted most frequently with Staphylococcus and Haemophilus; Staphylococcus--with Haemophilus and Bacillus; Haemophilus--with Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. The pH ranges for the three most often found genus were: for Staphylococcus--7.7-9, for Streptococcus--7.7-9.3 and for Haemophilus--8.2-8.8.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  - Development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. The normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. Within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. Horizontal spread of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. An ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. Prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. Prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. Experience from Scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of use is low (about 5%) and stable.

Prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. Prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. Experience from Scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of use is low (about 5%) and stable.
TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: Time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Haemophilus influenzae. METHODS: For time-kill studies, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. Inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/mL in each antibiotic solution. Growth controls were included. Viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. RESULTS: In general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. At 0.5 x MIC, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. At 1.0 x MIC, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus within 30 minutes, and S. epidermidis and S. marcescens within 90 minutes. Overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for H. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of S. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. CONCLUSION: Time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. Both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  - Adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [Gorter et al. (1998) J. Infect. Dis. 178, 1067-1078]. In this study, we showed that the adherence of H. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). Defensins stimulated also the adherence of Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae to the NCI-H292 cell line. In contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These results suggest that the defensin-enhanced adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.
TI  - [Study of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotics resistance in Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - Macrolide antibiotics (Mac) consist of a 12- to 16-membered lactone ring combined with a sugar moiety, and they inhibit protein synthesis via binding to 23S ribosomal RNA in bacteria. The 14- and 16-membered Mac are used for treating infectious diseases caused by Gram-positive and other bacteria; e.g., Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, Campylobacter, Treponema pallidum and Mycoplasma. Resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin-B (MLS) antibiotics in staphylococci is known to have the following mechanisms: 1) alteration of the target on ribosome due to dimethylation of a specific adenine residue in the 23S ribosomal RNA by the product of the erm gene, and consequently a decrease in binding of MLS antibiotics; 2) inactivation of streptogramin-B (STG-B) and lincosamide by the products of the sbh (encoding streptogramin B hydrolase) and linA' (encoding 3-lincomycin 4-clindamycin O-nucleotidyltransferase) genes, respectively; and 3) active efflux of Mac and STG-B antibiotics determined by the msrA and msrB genes in Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus xylosus, respectively, both of which appear to act as an ATP-dependent efflux pump. I have shown that Staphylococcus aureus 8325(pEP2104) exhibits inducible resistance to PMS (partial macrolide and streptogramin B)-antibiotics [the 14-membered macrolides, erythromycin (EM), and oleandomycin (OL), and the 16-membered macrolide mycinamicin (MCM) and STG-B]. The sequence of the N-terminal amino acid residues of a 63 kDa protein (MsrSA) that appeared in the membrane of PMS-resistant strains was identical to that of an MsrA polypeptide related to enhanced efflux of [14C]EM. Ribosomes from PMS-resistant strains showed a similar affinity for EM to those from the PMS-sensitive host strain NCTC8325, and no inactivation of EM by 8325(pEP2104) was observed. In the present study, I showed the DNA sequence of the msrSA region on the constitutive PMS-resistant plasmid pMC38, PMS-inducible resistant plasmid pEP2104 and PMS-sensitive mutant plasmid pSP6, and the region that is essential for inducible expression in PMS resistance. In addition, I investigated the relationship between PMS resistance and intracellular accumulation of EM.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. Genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. In this study the binding of purified MBL to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. Diverse Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci exhibited strong binding of MBL, whereas Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. In contrast, beta-hemolytic group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. Bound MBL was able to promote C4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that MBL may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Bacterial pathogens in chronic otitis media with effusion in Alaska Native children.
AB  - This study examined the bacterial pathogens and the presence of possible risk factors for the development of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) in a group of Alaska Native children. Middle ear aspirates were collected from 128 children < 6 years of age requiring tympanocentesis between 1987 and 1989. Bacterial pathogens were cultured from 40% of 209 fluids. Predominant isolates, after contamination of the outer ear was controlled for, were Haemophilus influenzae (21%; 84% of these were nontypeable), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.1%; serotypes 6B, 10A, 11A, 14, 18B, 18C, 19A, and 23F), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.8%), and Moraxella (Brahmanella) catarrhalis (2.9%). Pneumococcal-C-polysaccharide (PnC) was detectable in 3 of 135 (2.2%) aspirates that did not grow Streptococcus pneumoniae. Combining culture and PnC assay results evidence of pneumococcal infection was found in almost 10% of aspirates tested. There was not a significant difference in the number of episodes of acute otitis media after the first year of life based on the age at the first episode (< 6 mo, > or = 6 mo). However, 88% of infants in the study had their first acute otitis media episode before 1 year of age.
TI  - New patterns of infecting organisms in late bleb-related endophthalmitis: a ten year review.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the risk factors, causative organisms and visual outcomes in patients with late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis. METHODS: Medical records of all patients with the clinical diagnosis of late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis undergoing vitreous aspirates for culture at our institution from January 1987 to July 1996 were reviewed. Late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis was defined as conjunctival injection, bleb purulence and intraocular inflammation developing at least 1 month following filtering surgery. RESULTS: Forty-nine cases of bleb-related endophthalmitis developed in 42 patients (23 men, 19 women). Mean patient age was 62.1 +/- 19.3 years (range 5-94 years). Thirty-nine patients underwent prior filtering surgery (superior trabeculectomy, 24 eyes; inferior trabeculectomy, 10 eyes; combined superior trabeculectomy/cataract extraction, 4 eyes; posterior lip sclerectomy, 1 eye) and 3 had inadvertent blebs following cataract extraction. Endophthalmitis developed an average of 25.4 +/- 23.5 months (range 1-96 months) post-operatively. Antifibrosis agents were used in 25 of 39 eyes undergoing filtering surgery (mitomycin C, 13 eyes; 5-fluorouracil, 12 eyes). Bleb leaks were documented in a total of 32 of 49 (65%) cases either before or at the time of endophthalmitis diagnosis. Vitreous cultures were positive in 42 of 49 (86%) cases. The most frequently cultured organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (13), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12), Streptococcus species (8) and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 32 of 49 (65%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcal species were the most frequently cultured organisms in this series and may be associated with better visual outcomes. Although a causal relationship cannot be established, these results suggest a strong association between bleb leaks and endophthalmitis.
TI  - Etiology of septic arthritis in children: an update for the 1990s.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the etiology of septic arthritis in children after implementation of HIB immunization guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective review of all charts with a discharge diagnosis of septic arthritis (ICD-9: 711) from January 1991 to December 1996 at St. Louis Children's Hospital was conducted. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (male = 58%) were identified, whose median age was 6.0 years. Twenty-one children (33%) were misdiagnosed on initial presentation. An organism was isolated in 38 (59%) of cases. The predominant organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (10 isolates), Group A Streptococcus (4), Enterobacter species (4), Kingella kingae (3), Neisseria meningitides (3), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2), Candida (2), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2). The only isolate of Haemophilus influenzae type B was in 1992 in an unimmunized 14 month old. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm Staphylococcus aureus as a frequent pathogen and suggest that H influenzae type B is no longer the predominant isolate in young children with septic arthritis. In addition, early septic arthritis in children is frequently misdiagnosed on initial evaluation.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin A, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against 719 recent clinical Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type cultures. HMR 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with MIC90s of < or =0.5 mg/L, except for Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC90 > 128 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) and the anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) and Clostridium difficile (MIC90 = 1 mg/L). In general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the MICs of HMR 3647. Additionally, the in-vitro activity of HMR 3647 was not affected by the presence of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. The antichlamydial activity of HMR 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.
TI  - Bacteriology of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - The bacteriology of chronic sinusitis was studied by using swab and mucosal specimens from both the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. The specimens of the maxillary sinus were taken through translabial antroscopy. The specimens of the ethmoid sinus were taken after removing the ethmoid bulla during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Eighty-six samples of each type of specimen were collected. Among the maxillary sinus samples, the culture rate was 60.5 per cent from the swab specimens and 36 per cent from the mucosal specimens. Among the ethmoid sinus samples, the culture rate was 58.1 per cent from the swab specimens and 75.6 per cent from the mucosal. The p-value by the Chi-Square test is higher than 0.01 (p = 0.015). As there were more isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis from the mucosal specimens, they are not a better choice of specimen for sampling the ethmoid sinus than a swab specimen.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to Staphylococcus aureus (200), Staphylococcus epidermidis (200), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20), Escherchia coli (200), Klebsiella spp. (177), Serratia marcescens (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), Haemophilus influenzae (35) and Salmonella (38) from the Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). Fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of H. influenzae, Salmonella and S. pneumoniae, more than 75% of Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae and 50% of P. aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for Klebsiella, S. aureus and epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for Salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for Serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for Haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae. Levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the distribution of resistant strains in Italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were concerned. Quality control parameters are also summarized. S. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. In fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. These results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.
TI  - The effect of successful contact lens wear on mucosal immunity of the eye.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of contact lens wear on the mucosal defenses of the outer eye against infection. DESIGN: A case-controlled study of daily contact lens wearers in their initial 6 months of contact lens wear. PARTICIPANTS: Contact lens wearers (mean age, 23.1 years; 47 subjects) were compared with age-matched control subjects (mean age, 24.7 years; 44 subjects). INTERVENTION: Outer eye defenses were studied by assay of tear constituents and quantitative conjunctival microbiology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antimicrobial activity of tears was studied by assay of total immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgA isotype-specific antibodies reactive with Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, albumin and lysozyme, and the ocular surface microbial load determined using quantitative microbiology of the conjunctival sac. RESULTS: The IgA isotype-specific antibodies reactive with E. coli (P = 0.03) and S. epidermidis (P = 0.068) were lower in contact lens wearers, but antibody:albumin ratios were not significantly different in the two groups. Contact lens wear also had no significant effect on tear IgA, albumin, or lysozyme or its ratios with albumin. Bacterial numbers and colonization rates for coagulase-negative staphylococci were greater in contact lens wearers than in age-matched control subjects. Corynebacterium sp. and non-Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.007) were isolated more frequently and in greater numbers from contact lens wearers. Colonization rates were increased for Corynebacterium sp., but non-Enterobacteriaceae were transient. In both daily contact lens wearers and age-matched control subjects, most conjunctival flora were transient rather than colonizing, and no subject developed an outer eye infection during the study. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that daily contact lens wear does not significantly alter the mucosal defenses of the outer eye that function to eliminate organisms from the conjunctival sac and prevent outer eye infection.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis after ampicillin therapy.
AB  - The bacteriologies of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were studied in 74 chronic sinusitis patients who took ampicillin (500 mg every 6 hours) for 2 weeks preoperatively. The specimens from one ipsilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were obtained when undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery. In 74 specimens of the maxillary sinus, 38 bacterial isolates were recovered. The culture rate was 46.0%. On the other hand, 34 bacterial isolates were taken from the ethmoid sinus specimens. The culture rate was 41.9%. As compared with a previous group who did not take any antibiotic preoperatively, the culture rate significantly decreased in the maxillary as well as the ethmoid sinus specimens. Not surprisingly, a significantly decreased sensitivity to ampicillin was also found in the recovered bacteria from both the maxillary sinus (23.7%) and ethmoid sinus (5.9%) specimens. These results demonstrate that antibiotic therapy with ampicillin could eradicate most sensitive bacteria in chronic sinusitis. However, persistence of resistant bacteria was demonstrated.
TI  - A review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly SM-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. Overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. Meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against Gram-negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. In contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against Gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. These extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - CQ-397 and CQ-414: antimicrobial activity and spectrum of two fluoroquinolone---cephalosporin, dual-action compounds with carboxamido bonds.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential spectrum of activity of two novel dual-action compounds with carboxamido bonds (CQ-397 and CQ-414; Laboratorios Aranda, San Rafael, Mexico) against human pathogens. METHODS: Approximately 800 Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic clinical bacteria were tested in vitro using the Mueller-Hinton broth microdilution method of the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: CQ-397 (cefamandole+enrofloxacin) and CQ-414 (cefamandole+norfloxacin) were equally potent against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 range, 0.06--0.5 microg/mL and 0.06--1 microg/mL, respectively). Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 microg/mL) and Providencia spp. (MIC90, >32 microg/mL) exhibited elevated study drug MICs. Enterobacteriaceae resistant to fluoroquinolones generally remained resistant. CQ-397 and CQ-414 were active against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 microg/mL) and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL), but not oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, >32 microg/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC90, 8 microg/mL), and enterococci (MIC90s, 8 to >32 microg/mL). There was no difference in the dual-action drug activity (MIC90, 2 microg/mL) between penicillin-susceptible and -resistant pneumococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible (MIC range, less-than-or-equal0.015--0.06 microg/mL) to both compounds. CONCLUSIONS: The activity of these novel dual-action compounds, formed from the bonding of older antimicrobials, warrants further investigation for potential human and/or animal health use, including toxicology and pharmacokinetics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - [Clinical studies on acute otitis media in infants less than one year old].
AB  - Epidemiological and bacteriological studies were made on 164 infants less than 1  year old with acute otitis media (OMA) treated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Matsuyama Red Cross Hospital between January 1991 and December 1993. The patients consisted of 101 males (61.6%) and 63 females (38.4%). Compared with the general population in Matsuyama city, the preponderance of male patients with OMA is statistically significant at the level of P = 0.05. In infants less than 1 year old males are likely to be more susceptible to OMA than females. One hundred and four patients among the 164 (63.4%) were referred by pediatricians. Fever was the most common symptom (57.9%) and the next was otorrhea (19.5%). Between the patients younger than 6 months (younger group) and those 6 months old or older (older group) there were epidemiological differences which were statistically significant at the level of P = 0.05. The older group contained 128 patients (78.0%) and the younger group 36 (22.0%). The difference in incidence between the two groups indicates that infants 6 months old or older are more susceptible to OMA than those younger than 6 months. In the older group 76.6% of the patients had bilateral OMA, while in 38.9% of those in the younger group the OMA was bilateral. In infants 6 months old or older bilateral involvement and, in contrast, in infants younger than 6 months unilateral involvement was more frequent. The period needed to cure OMA was confirmed for 179 ears of 106 patients. For 80 (44.7%) of the 179 ears the period extended beyond 4 weeks. Seventy-five of the 80 ears were those of patients in the older group. OMA in the older group tended to be more resistant to treatment. The middle ear secretion of 117 ears was examined bacteriologically. Specimens were collected from middle ear effusion of 99 ears following myringotomy and from otorrhea in 18 ears. Cultures of 68 specimens were positive for one species of bacteria and 13 cultures yielded two species. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Haemophilus influenzae were the three most common microorganisms in middle ear effusion. But it was considered that S. spidermidis was not pathogenic and was a result of contamination. In otorrhea S. aureus was frequently found. No difference in the results of bacteriological study was noted between the two groups. Transplacental IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are known to decrease after birth and their serum levels are lowest between ages 6 months and 1 year. Then the serum levels of the immunoglobulins increase gradually with active production until age 4 years. The incidence and period of restitution of OMA in infants less than 1 year old in the present study seem to reflect the above Change in the serum levels of IgG1 and IgG2 mentioned. Based on the above results emphasis is placed on close cooperation between the otolaryngologist and the pediatrician in the treatment of OMA in an infant less than 1 year old. Particularly careful follow-up is important in patients in the older age group because they tend to be more susceptible to OMA and the disease is more resistant to treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Contamination of multi-use closed tracheal suction catheters: an in-vitro study.
AB  - The use of closed multi-use tracheal suction systems in ventilated patients is increasingly popular as it offers a number of potential physiological and microbiological advantages. As the use of these systems has been associated with an increased prevalence of tracheal colonization, effective self-cleaning mechanisms employed in these catheters are necessary. Using an in-vitro model we assessed the degree of catheter colonization in two multi-use catheter systems; Stericath and Trach-Care. Fifty of each catheter type were tested for colonization with five challenge organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 6571); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NCTC 10662); Haemophilus influenzae type b; S. epidermidis (slime producer); and S. epidermidis (slime non-producer). All five challenge strains had colonized both catheter types after 24 h and all 100 catheter tips were colonized. The extent and density of colonization was variable and interspecies variation in the pattern of catheter colonization was observed. The mean colonized lengths of Stericath catheters was 10.9 +/- 1.4 cm and of Trach-Care 2.7 +/- 1.3 cm (P < 0.0001).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - [Dirithromycin in the treatment of infections of the lower respiratory tract].
AB  - Good results of the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections with dirithromycin (Eli Lilly, USA), a new semisynthetic macrolide, were recorded. The trial included 15 patients: 6 with acute bronchitis (AB) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AB) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ECB). The antibiotic was administered orally in a single dose of 500 mg once a day for 7 days. The treatment efficacy was estimated by the clinical results and laboratory findings. The sputum specimens were investigated bacteriologically with testing the microflora for the drug susceptibility by using the diffusion disks. 50 per cent of the patients with AB isolated Streptococcus viridans with low (the diameter of the growth inhibition zones < 16 mm) and intermediate (16-17 mm) susceptibility to the antibiotic, 33.3 per cent of the patients isolated highly susceptible (19 mm) strains of Str. pneumonia and 16.7 per cent of the patients isolated resistant (15 mm) strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Highly susceptible (17-19 mm) strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Str. viridans were isolated respectively from 55.5 and 45.5 per cent of the patients with ECB. In 4 patients with ECB a clinical improvement of the state was recorded. In the other patients with AB and ECB the recovery was stated. The bacteriological tests revealed a new pathogen in 2 patients with ECB and the failure of the treatment in another 2 patients with ECB. In all the other patients the pathogen was shown to be eradicated. In the patients isolating the new pathogen the symptomatic recovery was stated in the posttherapeutic period. Therefore, diritromycin proved to be efficient in 13 out of the 15 patients with lower respiratory tract infections. It should be noted that the drug tolerance was excellent. None of the patients showed any adverse reactions.
TI  - Factors associated with positive bacteriological cultures of chronic middle ear effusions.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria have been isolated from middle ear effusions in a number of studies. Our aim was to identify factors which predispose to patients having positive cultures. Over a 1-year period, prospective data were collected on patients admitted for myringotomy. Middle ear effusions were collected at the time of surgery using specially designed traps, and underwent microscopy and culture. Data on local weather parameters were obtained from the Meteorological Office in Edinburgh, UK and compared with the patterns of positive cultures. A higher proportion of cultures were positive in October, November and December and in February and May than in the other months of the years. We were not able to relate these variations to any of the meteorological data, with the possible exception of relative humidity, or to any other variable.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of serous otitis].
AB  - The bacteriological study of the middle ear effusion of one hundred cases of serous otitis media was performed. Results are discussed and compared to those reported in the literature.
TI  - [Clinical and laboratory studies on SY5555 in pediatric infectious diseases].
AB  - Clinical effects of SY5555 dry syrup, a new oral penem antibiotic, were analysed  in 20 children with various bacterial infections. Ages of the patients varied from 8 months to 14 years. Doses of SY5555 were varied from 12.8 mg/kg/day to 30.5 mg/kg/day, and it was administered in 3 divided dosages. Clinical efficacy rates were as follows; 6/7 in acute bronchitis, 5/5 in pharyngotonsillitis, 3/3 in acute otitis media and 2/2 in cystitis and 3/3 in impetigo contagiosa. The overall rate was 95.0% (19/20). Bacteriologically, eradications were obtained with 1/2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3/3 of Staphylococcus aureus, 1/1 of Haemophilus influenzae, and each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Serratia marcescens. Diarrhea was observed in 1 patient. And elevated eosinophiles or GPT was observed in one patient each. In vivo pharmacokinetics of SY5555 was examined in 2 cases. Peak plasma levels were observed at 1 hour after dosage in one patient and at 2 hours in another upon oral administration of 8.3 mg/kg of SY5555, and peak levels were 2.44 and 1.38 micrograms/ml respectively. Half-lives of SY5555 were 1.39 and 0.59 hr. Concentrations of SY5555 in urine after administration were 70.2 (2-4 hrs.) to 91.0 (0-5 hrs.) micrograms/ml, respectively. SY5555 dry syrup is considered as an useful and safe antibiotic in treating the infectious diseases in children.
TI  - Effect of inflammation on intraocular penetration of intravenous ofloxacin in albino rabbits.
AB  - The effect of inflammation on the intraocular penetration of ofloxacin was studied in 20 albino rabbits (New Zealand White). Inflammation was induced in the left eye by inoculation of a suspension of 10(9) CFU of heat-killed Staphyloccus epidermidis per 0.1 ml of saline solution (0.9%) in the midvitreous cavity. The other eye was kept as a control. Twenty-four hours following inoculation, ofloxacin was administered in the marginal ear vein at a dose of 15 mg/kg over 20 min with an infusion pump. Animals were sacrificed at different times up to 24 h following drug administration. Ofloxacin levels were determined in aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and serum by a bioassay. Inflammation was scored on the basis of perilimbal and corneal reactions and vitreoretinal statuses. Inflammation had a relevant effect on intraocular penetration of ofloxacin, with levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye markedly exceeding the ones of the control eye. In the uninflamed eye, the levels were rapidly decaying below assay sensitivity and were no longer detectable at approximately 5 h following drug administration while they were still detectable in both ocular fluids of the inflamed eye at 24 h. Ofloxacin levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye were superior to the MIC for several of the bacteria which commonly cause endophthalmitis, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - Several standard intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) products are available in the United States and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. We evaluated more than 100 lots of IVIG, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. Neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in these preparations for Staphylococcus epidermidis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia, Ib, Ia/c, II and III; and Escherichia coli (K1). Pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. Within an IVIG lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains or serotypes of the same organism. Opsonic activity was significantly (P < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing method. We conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an IVIG lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. Clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of IVIG products by lot are known. In the future neonatal IVIG research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in cerebrospinal fluid by an assay for simultaneous detection of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci using a seminested PCR strategy.
AB  - Primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16S rRNA sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16S rRNA genes of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The PCR assay was divided into two DNA amplifications. The first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. The high specificity of the PCR assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). A total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. The assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. With agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the PCR products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) CFU/ml.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657, new rifamycin derivatives.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the new rifamycin derivatives KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were compared with those of rifampin. Rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin were also tested for reference. The respective MICs of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90S) were 0.016 and 0.0078 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.016 and 0.0039 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 0.0625 and 0.016 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. These MIC90S of KRM-1657 were equal to or 2- to 64-fold lower than those of rifampin. KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 with MIC90S of between 0.002 and 0.078 microgram/ml were 2- to 128-fold more active than rifampin against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC90S of KRM-1657 for Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 0.25 and 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively; KRM-1657 was almost as active as rifampin and was 8- to 16-fold more active than KRM-1648 against these strains. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutations to resistance to KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 was equal to that to rifampin. Against systemic infection with S. aureus in mice, the efficacies of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were comparable to that of rifampin.
TI  - Microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  - The microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of Goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. Non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. Streptococci, predominantly S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). Beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. Haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. H. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and H. influenzae being identified in only one sample. Anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. Staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, S. epidermidis dominating. Fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. Thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - The role of HSV-induced Fc- and C3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) induces Fc- and C3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. The role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to HSV-infected and non-infected HEp-2 cells. A flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of FITC-labelled bacteria, was developed. Opsonisation of Staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in adherence to HSV-infected cells and revealed a role for C3b(i)R- and FcR-mediated adhesion. However, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment to non-infected cells. Increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the HSV-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. Bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of E. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to HSV-infected cells.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Susceptibility survey of piperacillin alone and in the presence of tazobactam.
AB  - Among 325 fresh isolates of bacteria from 153 hospital patients with serious infections, 142 were susceptible to piperacillin, 129 were resistant and a further 54 exhibited a marked inoculum effect. Tazobactam restored the susceptibility of resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (except methicillin-resistant isolates), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Bacteroides fragilis. Among 87 Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to piperacillin, or showed an inoculum effect, 78 (89%) were restored to susceptibility by tazobactam. Pseudomonas spp. resistant to piperacillin were mostly resistant to the combination.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - [Reproducible model of a bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - To test the efficiency of antimicrobial substances on bacterial conjunctivitis under standardized conditions a reproducible model is needed. As there are no data in the literature concerning this topic we have developed a model of bacterial conjunctivitis in the rabbit eye. Instillation of a suspension of Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus into the cul-de-sac did not result in any effect. Thus, standardized techniques of conjunctival incision were used additionally. A follow-up was done for a period of 2 weeks (degree of conjunctival hyperemia, microbiology). Radial incision of the conjunctiva with injection of an S. aureus suspension (50 microliters of ATCC 29213; 1.35 x 10(8) cells) was done mimicking a branch injury. This resulted in a purulent conjunctivitis over a period of 1 week and disappeared within 14 days. The swabs were negative on day 7. This is the first model establishing a reproducible purulent conjunctivitis in the rabbit. Using this model antimicrobial substances may be tested under standardized conditions.
TI  - Clinical studies of oral quinolone once daily in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were studied. The most common species recovered from the sputum specimens of these patients were Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Gram positive cocci unidentified, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Morexella catarrhalis, Streptococcus epidermidis, and another Haemophilus species in this order. All these bacteria were susceptible to ofloxacin except for one strain of methicillin resistant S. aureus. A satisfactory clinical outcome was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%). It is concluded that ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, is useful for patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Infections of the central nervous system.
AB  - Infections of the central nervous system are common, serious medical conditions.  One hundred consecutive adult cases with purulent meningitis of known etiology encountered by the Medical Service at Parkland Memorial Hospital were reviewed. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (56 cases), followed by Neisseria meningitidis (16 cases) and Listeria monocytogenes (seven cases). Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci each accounted for five cases. An additional 15 patients had purulent meningitis with a pathogen being isolated. Twenty five purulent meningitis cases of known etiology after trauma or neurosurgery were reviewed. Staphylococcus aureus (five cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (four cases), and gram negative bacilli (14 cases) were the most common pathogens. Review of intracranial suppurative infections demonstrated advances in microbiology, antibiotic therapy, and imaging, leading to improvements in therapy. Subdural empyema continues to be a difficult diagnosis to make and apparently is related to the anatomic pathology of the infectious process. To illustrate salient features about granulomatous meningitis and encephalitis, cases of tuberculous meningitis, herpes simplex encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and encephalitis of undetermined etiology are presented and discussed.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent which  has an oxazine ring structure with a cyclopropyl moiety at C-10, was compared with those of other agents against 2,854 clinical isolates. T-3761 had a broad spectrum of activity and had potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Clostridium spp. tested were 0.39 to 6.25 micrograms/ml. Its activity was comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and four- to eightfold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, but its activity was two- to eightfold less than that of tosufloxacin. Some isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus (MIC of ciprofloxacin, greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) were still susceptible to T-3761 (MIC of T-3761, less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml). The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the streptococci and enterococci tested were 3.13 to 100 micrograms/ml. Its activity was equal to or 2- or 4-fold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, equal to or 2- or 4-fold less than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and 4- to 16-fold less than that of tosufloxacin. The activity of T-3761 against gram-negative bacteria was usually fourfold greater than those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin. Many isolates which were resistant to nonfluoroquinolone agents, such as minocycline- or imipenem-resistant S. aureus, ceftazidime-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, gentamicin- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, were susceptible to T-3761. The MBCs of T-3761 were either equal to or twofold greater than the MICs. The number of viable cells decreased rapidly during incubation with T-3761 at one to four times the MIC. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3761 against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa were 2.2 x 10(-8) to less than or equal to 1.2 x 10(-9). The 50% inhibitory concentrations of T-3761 for DNA gyrases isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa were 0.88 and 1.9 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - The bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect of trospectomycin.
AB  - Trospectomycin sulfate (trospectomycin, TRS) is a novel, broad-spectrum, aminocyclitol antibiotic that is being developed clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and gonorrhea. This study investigated the bactericidal activity (by time-kill kinetics) and the postantibiotic effect (PAE) of TRS. Species-dependent bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity was observed for TRS; the antibiotic was bacteriostatic for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli, and bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis (one of two test strains). When TRS was tested at four times its minimum inhibitory concentration or at a maximum test concentration of 32 micrograms/ml, with a 1-hr exposure period, the following PAE values were recorded: S. epidermidis 30032, 1.8 hr, En. faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.6 hr, E. coli UC 311, 1.5 hr, E. coli UC 9451, 1.5 hr, H. influenzae 30063, greater than 4.0 hr, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, 5.2 hr, and B. fragilis UC 12199, 6.7 hr. The broad-spectrum PAE that was observed for TRS is somewhat unique compared with other antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - Influence of topical steroid treatment on maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and adverse effects of budesonide administered as a nasal aerosol in addition to sinus washings and erythromycin therapy was assessed by comparison with placebo in a randomized, double-blind study of 40 patients with chronic or recurrent maxillary sinusitis. Most of the patients had been referred for operative treatment. Corticosteroid therapy, 400 micrograms daily, or placebo was continued for 3 months. Budesonide and antral irrigations reduced nasal symptoms more effectively than placebo, and there was a significantly greater reduction in facial pain and sensitivity in the budesonide group than in the placebo group. During the treatment period, mucosal thickening as evaluated by radiology decreased more clearly in the budesonide group than in the placebo group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Haemophilus influenzae. Only 2 of 20 Haemophilus strains were beta-lactamase producers. The cellular picture was dominated by neutrophils in all secretions. There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the two groups. Topical steroid therapy did not cause any adverse effects.
TI  - In vitro activity of OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro activity of OPC-17116, a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, was compared with the activities of other fluoroquinolones. OPC-17116 inhibited 50% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. At less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited, which was comparable to or better than the activities of fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin but less than the activity of ciprofloxacin. OPC-17116 inhibited 90% of the staphylococci tested at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Group A, B, C, F, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, being four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Tosufloxacin was the most active agent tested against gram-positive cocci. OPC-17116 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 4 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal effect of inoculum size on MIC, and the MBCs were within 1 dilution of the MICs. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased at pH 6 and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations, but it was unaffected by human serum. OPC-17116 showed a postantibiotic effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus similar to the postantibiotic effects reported for other fluoroquinolones. The frequency of spontaneous single-step resistance was low (less than 10(-9)), but repeated passage of organisms in the presence of OPC-17116 resulted in the selection of resistant isolates.
TI  - The bacteriology of bone allografts.
AB  - We report the contamination rate in the Cambridge bone bank of 35 consecutive allograft specimens, all harvested in a clean-air environment, using a strict aseptic technique and antibiotic cover. Five of 27 femoral heads taken from living donors and three of eight massive allografts taken from cadavers were found to be contaminated. The contaminated femoral heads were discarded. All massive allografts were rendered sterile by gamma-irradiation. It is important to exclude bacteriological contamination of harvested and banked bone.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in pediatric pathogens.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance is increasing in pediatric pathogens. Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and in S. epidermidis, and erythromycin resistance in group A streptococci are becoming major problems. Fortunately, all three species remain susceptible to vancomycin. In certain parts of the world, Haemophilus influenzae b that are resistant to a number of antibiotics are being recognized. Antibiotic therapy of pediatric infections in the future will continue to rely on yet-to-be developed agents.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Evaluation of the so-called basic cephalosporins using the serum bactericidal test].
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was studied one hour and four hours after intravenous administration of 1 g and 2 g cefotiam, 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin to six volunteers. The 136 clinical isolates tested included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. One hour after administration no significant differences in the activity against staphylococci were noted in the antibiotics tested. Four hours after administration of cefazolin 96% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were killed at a serum dilution of 1:8, whereas only one strain was killed by cefuroxime and none by cefotiam under the same conditions. The highest SBA-titers against Haemophilus influenzae were achieved with cefotiam at a dosage of 2 g. SBA-titers against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were higher after administration of 1 g cefotiam than after administration of 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin, respectively.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The comparative activity of fleroxacin, three other quinolones and eight unrelated antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin, a new trifluorinated quinolone was evaluated against 432 bacterial isolates. Fleroxacin was 1- to 2-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and at least as active as ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The MICs of fleroxacin for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml against all isolates of Enterobacteriaceae except Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) and Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). Fleroxacin was as active as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against Pseudomonas spp, (MIC90 for all quinolones tested were > 8 micrograms/ml). Acinetobacter and Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to fleroxacin; however fleroxacin was 1-fold less active than lomefloxacin against Acinetobacter and at least 1-fold less active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against H. influenzae. Methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-susceptible strains of S. aureus were very susceptible to fleroxacin, with an MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml (range 0.5-1 microgram/ml). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus spp. other than aureus and epidermidis were not susceptible to fleroxacin (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). In addition, fleroxacin as well as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were inactive against Enterococcus spp. (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were resistant to both fleroxacin and lomefloxacin but were very susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. These results suggest that fleroxacin represents a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by most Enterobacteriaceae and some species of staphylococcus.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Clinical & bacteriological profile of neonatal pneumonia.
AB  - In a prospective study of 44 neonates (33 outborn and 11 inborn) with pneumonia,  the bacteriology of pneumonia was determined by blood culture and serum counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). Twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. The lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and CIEP. CIEP was done to detect the bacterial antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. Low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. Altogether, a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). In 10 babies, Strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. Micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. Eleven babies (25%) grew Gram negative bacteria. The common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were Strep. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinatobacter lowfii, Staph. aureus, Pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. All the Gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin. All staphylococci isolated were sensitive to methicillin.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  - The major pathogens causing acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. The same organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. In chronic suppurative otitis media, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S aureus are most frequently found. Antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating AOM are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. Currently, about 20% of AOM cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually H influenzae or M catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. Concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in AOM than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.
TI  - In-vitro activity of WIN 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for S. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. All Lancefield group A, B, C, & G streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and S. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. For anaerobic bacteria WIN 57273 had an MIC90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for Clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. WIN 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. The MIC90 of WIN 57273 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. WIN 57273 was more active against Gram-negative bacteria at acid pH, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. Resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - [Neonatal conjunctivitis in a nursery and a neonatal unit].
AB  - After Crede prophylaxis was abandoned at our hospital in 1984 scrupulous clinical surveillance of all neonates for conjunctivitis, and bacterial cultures from purulent eye discharge, have become routine. During the two-year period 1 March 1987 to 28 February 1989, testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (EIA-technique) was added in all infants with clinical conjunctivitis. During the period concerned there were 332 cases of conjunctivitis among 4,520 live born infants, an incidence of 7.3%. The incidence was higher for infants staying in the nursery (8.2%) than for those admitted to the neonatal unit (3.5%) (p less than 0.01). 90% of the infections were diagnosed during the first week of life. 468 isolates were identified by routine bacteriological investigation, 452 gram-positives (96.6%), and 16 gram-negatives (3.4%). The following strains were found: Staphylococcus aureus 171 (51.5% of the patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis 153 (46.1%), Streptococcus viridans 106 (31.9%), diphteroids 11 (3.3%), beta-hemolytic streptococci seven (2.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae two (0.6%), enterococci two (0.6%), Hemophilus influenzae six (1.8%), Escherichia coli five (1.5%), Proteus two (0.6%) and Branhamella catarrhalis one (0.3%). Not a single case of gonococcal ophthalmia was diagnosed. Positive tests for Chlamydia were found in 13 infants (3.9% of all infants with conjunctivitis), an incidence of 0.3% for the whole population of live born infants. Six of the chlamydia infections (46%) occurred within the first week of life. Expenses for chlamydia testing were estimated to be NOK 1,020 per positive test. Preventing conjunctivitis in our nursery and neonatal unit calls for strategies to protect newborn infants from colonization with pathogenic bacteria, especially S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Acute shift in immune response to microbial activators in very-low-birth-weight infants.
AB  - Investigation of lymphocyte activation in vitro to microbial pathogens was undertaken in very-low-birth-weight infants during the first 2 weeks of life. Twenty-three infants with birth weights less than 1500 g were studied on day 1. Normal adults (n = 23) and cord blood from seven full-term infants were used as controls. Longitudinal studies were also carried out on seven of the 23 infants 2 weeks following delivery. Results indicated that lymphocyte responses of very-low-birth-weight infants on day 1 of life were significantly greater than those of both adult controls and full-term infants, particularly to Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcal protein A. In contrast, response to the T cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was significantly less in very-low-birth-weight infants than in adult controls and full-term infants. The seven very-low-birth-weight infants studied showed a down-regulation of immune response in the 2 weeks following birth, such that responses on day 14 were significantly less than those on day 1 for the same activators. This shift in immune response appears to have important implications for the immune development and host defence in the post-natal period.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - The in-vitro and disc susceptibility testing of clarithromycin and its 14-hydroxy metabolite.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of clarithromycin, its 14-hydroxy metabolite  and a combination containing clarithromycin and the 14-hydroxy metabolite in a ratio of three parts of the former to one part of the latter were compared with erythromycin by determination of MICs. Disc susceptibility testing was also performed using discs containing 6 micrograms clarithromycin, 6 micrograms clarithromycin with 2 micrograms 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, 3 micrograms clarithromycin and 3 micrograms clarithromycin with 1 microgram 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin. This was to determine a suitable disc content and minimum zone diameter to distinguish between sensitive and resistant strains using a breakpoint of 4 mg/l clarithromycin. Clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, although the 14-hydroxy metabolite was more active against H. influenzae. The clarithromycin/14-hydroxy metabolite combination was most active against beta-haemolytic streptococci (Groups A-C) (mode MIC 0.06 mg/l). The parent compound and the combination were similarly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 0.12 mg/l). Branhamella catarrhalis was more susceptible to clarithromycin (MIC90 0.06) than to erythromycin (MIC90 0.25 mg/l). Activities of all compounds against S. epidermidis and enterococci were similar but against Neisseria species erythromycin was the more active compound. The 6 micrograms clarithromycin disc strength was found to give the most consistent results for all isolates. Using a breakpoint of 4 mg/l, minimum zone diameters indicative of sensitivity were as follows: 16 mm for staphylococci, 17 mm for respiratory pathogens and 11 mm for streptococci and Neisseria spp.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of faeriefungin, a new broad-spectrum polyene macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of faeriefungin, a new pentaene macrolide lactone antibiotic produced by Streptomyces griseus var. autotrophicus, against 263 clinical bacterial isolates was examined. In contrast to the related fungicidal antibiotics nystatin and amphotericin B, which show no activity against bacteria, faeriefungin showed bactericidal activity against all species of gram-positive bacteria examined. MICs for these species ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml, and the MIC for 90% of the isolates tested was 32 micrograms/ml. Isolates of some fastidious gram-negative species, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae, were slightly susceptible to faeriefungin, with MICs ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, but all members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae, with the exception of Pseudomonas cepacia, were completely resistant to faeriefungin at the concentrations tested. Faeriefungin is also active against fungi, nematodes, and mosquito larvae. The mode of action of faeriefungin against both bacteria and fungi is under investigation.
TI  - Clinical management of orbital cellulitis in children.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out by the Department of Ophthalmology and the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario to assess the outcome of our medical management of orbital cellulitis in children using a predetermined antibiotic regimen and to determine whether computed tomographic (CT) evidence of a subperiosteal abscess alone was an indication for surgical drainage. Between February 1985 and January 1988, 23 patients with true orbital cellulitis were admitted. CT scans were ordered routinely at the time of admission. The scans were cancelled for 13 children because they responded rapidly to medical management. CT showed edema nasal to the medial rectus, or thickening or displacement of the muscle in 8 of the 10 children who underwent the procedure. Three children required sinus and orbital drainage, but frank purulent material was found subperiosteally in only one. The results suggest that most children with orbital cellulitis can be managed with the prompt use of the appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Therapy with cloxacillin sodium and chloramphenicol or, in children under age 6 years, cefuroxime best covers the spectrum of organisms responsible for most cases of orbital cellulitis in children. CT should be used as an ancillary guide to the need for surgical exploration of the orbit in patients who do not rapidly respond to medical management.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - Ceftriaxone monotherapy for bacterial meningitis in children.
AB  - A total of 33 patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with single daily doses of ceftriaxone (CTR 100 mg/kg/day i.v.) for a median duration of 13 days. Pathogens isolated by culture and/or determined by latex agglutination were 15 Haemophilus influenzae b, 7 Neisseria meningitidis, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 group B streptococcus, 2 Streptococcus viridans and 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis. In 4 cases a diagnosis of purulent meningitis could only be made by means of the inflammatory liquor parameters. All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug levels even at the end of the dosing interval were at least 10-fold higher than the MICs of the respective bacterial isolates. The average penetration of CTR into the CSF was 6.6%. Within 12-46 h after the first dose, control spinal taps were performed. Cultures were sterile in all cases. Side effects encountered were diarrhea, exanthema, neutropenia and transient elevation of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, but none caused a change of therapy. One patient developed a biliary concrement. No patient died; 5 patients had prolonged fever (greater than 5 days), and 2 were left with persistent hearing deficiencies. CTR can be recommended as a safe and effective antibiotic agent for once daily treatment of bacterial meningitis in children.
TI  - [Microbiologic aspects of bacteremia in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit].
AB  - The microbiologic aspects of the bacteriemia were prospectively studied in patients hospitalized in a pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Thirty six episodes of bacteriemia were detected in 29 patients. Secondary bacteriemia prevailed on the primary ones. The most frequent infectious foci associated with bacteriemia were the infections of respiratory tract, followed by intravascular catheterism. The microorganisms more frequently associated with bacteriemia were: Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Eacherichia coli and Pseudomonas seruginosa.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Blood cultures: eight years' experience of a conventional in-house system and trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities.
AB  - In a prospective analysis of 4234 significant isolates from 62,437 consecutive sets of blood cultures over an 8 year period, 79.4% were detected within 48 h. Routine examination of Gram-film smears made within 24 h of receipt of the cultures detected about half of all positive cultures. Many organisms were detected earlier on Castaneda slopes than in tryptone soya broth. Haemophilus influenzae (type b) and Neisseria spp. were usually suspected on clinical grounds, and early blind subculture was successful in 95.7% and 69% of cases respectively. Resistance to trimethoprim among Gram-negative coliforms increased significantly over the 8 year period. Production of beta-lactamase was detected in 12% of Haemophilus influenzae (type b). Unlike Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis was commonly resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidic acid and gentamicin.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - [Experimental and clinical studies on cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  - 1. Absorption and elimination Serum and urinary levels of cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221) were determined in 7 children with ages ranging from 3 to 12 years after a intravenous bolus injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. The average serum level of the drug was 119.27 +/- 13.83 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, then decreased gradually with a half-life of 2.01 +/- 0.25 hours to 10.56 +/- 2.93 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. The average urinary elimination rate was 77.34 +/- 12.60%. 2. Clinical study CDZM was given to the following 39 patients with ages ranging from 2 months to 15 years and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. The treated cases were 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 30 cases of acute pneumonia, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media and 2 cases of acute urinary tract infections. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 29 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.1%. Organisms presumed to be pathogens included 3 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9 Haemophilus influenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain and 8 non-producing strains) and 1 Enterococcus faecalis. The last one was decreased and the others were eradicated with an eradication rate of 93.3% for all strains. Adverse reactions occurred in no patients. Abnormal changes in laboratory test values involved only 1 case each of elevated GOT, elevated GOT and GPT, eosinophilia and thrombocytosis. Based on the above-mentioned result and features of this drug, it was confirmed that this drug showed an excellent usefulness in the treatment of infections in childhood. It may be also effective in the management of infections under immunosuppression.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, QA-241.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, QA-241, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) -1,7-dioxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ii]quinolizine-2-carboxylic hydrochloride, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. QA-241 inhibited 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. It was two-fold and four- to 16-fold less active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. QA-241 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species than ciprofloxacin. Most Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. The MIC for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 1 microgram/ml, as was that for S. epidermidis. For streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. QA-241 had minimal activity against anaerobic species. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-9) for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. However, resistant strains could be isolated by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity was less at an acid pH and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations. QA-241 showed a good postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lomefloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone. Studies on in vitro antimicrobial spectrum,  potency, and development of resistance.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (NY-198; SC-47111), a potent new difluoroquinolone, was studied to compare its in vitro activity with that of other antimicrobials against 2194 clinical isolates. Lomefloxacin showed excellent inhibitory and bactericidal activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae and inhibited greater than 99% of the isolates at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml or less. Lomefloxacin exhibited good-to-moderate activity against strains of Acinetobacter (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml), but poor activity for Pseudomonas cepacia (MIC90 greater than 16 micrograms/ml). Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were susceptible (MIC90 1 micrograms/ml) to lomefloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae, (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml), and Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml) were highly susceptible to lomefloxacin. Streptococcal isolates, especially viridans streptococci, were considerably less susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. Overall, lomefloxacin had comparable activity to norfloxacin, fleroxacin, and ofloxacin, and against many facultative anaerobes lomefloxacin was more active than imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Development of resistance to lomefloxacin by spontaneous mutation was low and comparable to that of other fluoroquinolones. Growth in subinhibitory concentrations resulted in increased resistance to fluoroquinolones for selected test strains.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - Bacteriology of otitis media with effusion.
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria present in the middle ear of patients with otitis media with effusion. Middle ear effusions (MEE), nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were obtained at operation and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Two hundred and fifty-nine effusions were obtained from 152 subjects examined. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated from 32 (12.3 per cent) effusions, Streptococcus pneumoniae from seven (2.7 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus from seven (2.7 per cent), Branhamella catarrhalis from one (0.4 per cent)--Group A beta haemolytic streptococci from one (0.4 per cent) and Staphylococcus epidermidis from three (1.9 per cent). The occurrence of respiratory pathogens in MEE reflected their prevalence in the upper respiratory tract. Significantly fewer children who had received antibiotics prior to surgery had organisms present in the MEE. Eight and a half per cent of H. influenzae and 64 per cent of B. catarrhalis were resistant to ampicillin. The present study confirms that bacteria are present in the middle ear in a significant number of patients with otitis media with effusion.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A rapid penicillinase paper strip test for the detection of beta-lactamase].
AB  - The penicillinase paper strip beta-lactamase detecting test is an easy and rapid  method which gives the information about some organism susceptibility to penicillins, immediately after their primary isolation. This information is important in serious infection treatment. This test is a modification of the standard iodometric test and is performed on paper penicillin and starch impregnated strips. The paper penicillinase strip test has been evaluated in speed, accuracy and value; it was compared with iodometric test, nitrocefin test and penicillin susceptibility test. The following fresh clinical isolates were used: 247 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 20 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and 36 Haemophilus influenzae strains; total 303 isolates. The high correlation among all three tests mentioned in beta-lactamase detection was found as well as the correlation between penicillin susceptibility and this enzyme production. The sequence of susceptibility of the tests used is obtained as follows: nitrocefin test, paper penicillinase strip test, iodometric test.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus in otitis media with effusion.
AB  - Bacteriologic investigation of middle ear effusion (MEE), external ear canal, and the nasopharynx was carried out on 458 patients with otitis media with effusion. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common bacteria in MEE, even after excluding the contaminants from the external ear canal, which had the same value of minimal inhibitory concentration as the paired MEE. The bacterial agreement of S epidermidis between MEE and the nasopharynx was extremely rare in contrast with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Branhamella catarrhalis, although the organism was also frequently isolated from the nasopharynx. Staphylococcus aureus, having the same minimal inhibitory concentration as that in the nasopharynx, was more frequently found in MEE than S epidermidis. The results suggest that S epidermidis found in MEE is not a pathogen, but rather a contaminant in many instances. Staphylococcus aureus seems to be a causative agent in otitis media with effusion.
TI  - Serous otitis media (S.O.M.). A bacteriological study of the ear canal and the middle ear.
AB  - A bacteriological study of the middle-ear effusions and the ear canals in children with chronic serous otitis media (S.O.M.) was performed. Sixty-eight children (127 ears) were investigated. From this study it appeared that cleansing of the ear canal with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol for 30 s is partially effective; micro-organisms (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis) could still be isolated in 29%. Cleansing of the ear canal decreases the incidence of middle-ear fluid contamination by non-pathogenic ear canal organisms (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aerococcus), but after cleansing, 'non-pathogenic' micro-organisms could still be isolated in 33% of the effusions (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis). From 12% of the middle-ear effusions pathogenic micro-organisms (Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus pneumoniae) were isolated; cleansing of the ear canal did not influence this percentage. Anaerobics were not isolated from the middle-ear effusions.
TI  - Bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. The authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from January 1983 to March 1986 at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. All patients were followed for at least 6 months. Clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. The causative organisms among those patients included: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); Staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); Hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); Moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). In addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. Herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). Statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (P less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (P less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (P less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (P less than 0.0001). The authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.
TI  - Prospective evaluation of bacterial antigen detection in cerebral spinal fluid in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in a predominantly adult hospital.
AB  - The results of all CSF latex agglutination (LA) tests performed in a large predominantly adult hospital over 1 yr are reviewed. Eight cases of bacterial meningitis were recognized during this time, and of these only three were due to organisms detectable by commercially available LA kits. In one case, the LA was uninterpretable, and in the second the LA was not performed because less than 5 x 10(6) WBC/L were seen in the CSF. In the third case the Gram stain was positive. No cases of partially treated meningitis were diagnosed. In this setting, the LA test did not contribute significantly to patient management.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of ME1207, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - ME1207 (pivaloyloxymethyl ester of ME1206) is a new oral cephalosporin. ME1206 is (6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)- acetamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-ethyl]-cephem-4-carboxy lic acid. The susceptibilities of about 1,600 clinical isolates to ME1206 were determined by the agar dilution method. ME1206 showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ME1206 was more active than cefaclor, T-2525, and cefixime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of ME1206 was comparable with that of T-2525, but ME1206 was less active than cefixime. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, ME1206 had high activity (MIC, less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml). ME1206 was stable against various beta-lactamases, except beta-lactamases from Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Escherichia coli W3630 (Rms213). The 50% effective doses of ME1207 after oral administration against systemic infections in mice were comparable with those of T-2588 against gram-negative bacteria and about one-fourth that of T-2588 against Staphylococcus aureus Smith.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - The effects of sinus bacteria on human ciliated nasal epithelium in vitro.
AB  - The mechanisms by which bacteria colonize and damage ciliated epithelium are important in understanding the pathophysiology of rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis. Bacteria that have the ability to impair mucociliary clearance would be at an advantage in establishing infection of ciliated surfaces. This study investigates the effect of Hemophilus Influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis on the ciliary activity of normal ciliated nasal epithelium in human beings. Ciliary activity of the nasal epithelium in the presence of each pathogen was assessed for more than 240 minutes with a photometric method of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) measurement. H. influenzae exerted significant effects on ciliary activity, with a 46% decrease in the CBF by 4 hours (with bacteria-containing broth) and a 32% decrease with bacteria-free filtrate. S. epidermidis decreased CBF by 44% with the bacterial broth. A sterile cell-free filtrate had no significant effect. S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis had no significant effect on CBF within a 240-minute period. H. influenzae and S. epidermidis disrupted normal synchronous ciliary motion, causing adjacent cilia to beat at different rates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro studies of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. An agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (MIC 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). Ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. Tobramycin was highly active against P. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. The quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. All the quinolones showed high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. The pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (MIC range 4-32 mg/l). All isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). Cefuroxime was also highly active against N. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against H. influenzae. The quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against Bacteroides fragilis isolates (MIC range 1-16 mg/l). The MICs of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at pH 8.8 than those obtained at pH 5.8 and 7.3. The activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in pH.
TI  - Ceftriaxone in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults.
AB  - Twenty-six adults with acute bacterial meningitis were enrolled in an open randomized comparative study. The organisms isolated from CSF were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. 13 patients (group A) were treated once daily with intravenous ceftriaxone (Rocephin). The 13 patients in group B received ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol in 4 doses/day. The mean duration of therapy in groups A and B was 9.9 and 12.3 days, respectively. This difference in the duration of therapy was statistically significant. All patients from group A showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. In group B only 12 patients were clinically and bacteriologically cured; 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the therapy because CSF culture remained positive after 48 h of therapy. Ceftriaxone was well tolerated in all patients; ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol were associated with diarrhea and skin rash in 6 patients.
TI  - In-vitro activity of roxithromycin against respiratory and skin pathogens.
AB  - The activity of roxithromycin was determined by a microdilution method, in comparison with erythromycin, spiramycin and josamycin. Roxithromycin and erythromycin showed very similar MICs against staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. In most cases, spiramycin and josamycin appeared similarly or more active. The activity of roxithromycin against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydia psittaci and, to some extent, against Pasteurella spp. was also assessed, by suitable in-vitro methods. Roxithromycin has a promising potential for treating selected skin and respiratory infections.
TI  - SIGNAL blood culture system for detection of bacteremia in neonates.
AB  - In the SIGNAL (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) blood culture system, gas produced by bacterial metabolism displaces medium from the culture bottle into an upper reservoir via a hollow needle. Displacement of media may provide a visual indication of the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms in a single medium. The single-bottle SIGNAL system was compared with paired BACTEC 16B and 7D (Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Towson, Md.) radiometric system bottles by using bacterial inocula and conditions which simulated those found in neonatal and pediatric populations. The single SIGNAL bottle was a good as the combined BACTEC media for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but was slower for Candida spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and pneumococci. The SIGNAL system failed to detect four of five isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and four of eight anaerobic organisms. The SIGNAL system is not suitable for neonatal blood cultures at its present state of development.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the oral cephalosporin BMY-28100.
AB  - BMY-28100 was compared with cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram and found to be more active than the reference cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium difficile. BMY-28100 was the next most active, after cefteram, against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BMY-28100 showed similar activity to that of cefaclor. The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100, including bactericidal activity, against Staphylococcus aureus was less affected by penicillinase-production than was that of cefaclor. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against various types of penicillinases, especially against the penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new penem antimicrobial agent, CGP 31608, was compared with those of imipenem, SCH 34343, and several other antimicrobial agents against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. CGP 31608 was active against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Penicillin-resistant streptococci (including enterococci) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were more resistant to the penem. Activities of CGP 31608 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with MIC90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. Against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and P. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to CGP 31608. The new drug was also active against anaerobes (MIC90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and Legionella spp. (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). CGP 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and SCH 34343 (except that the latter is not active against P. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. However, CGP 31608 demonstrated more activity (MIC90) than imipenem against P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus.
TI  - Culture of abdominal aortic aneurysm contents. An additional series.
AB  - We evaluated the microbiologic nature of aneurysm contents. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken from non-blood fluid, laminar thrombus, or ulcerated plaque within aortic aneurysms operated on during an eight-year period. Positive bacterial cultures were obtained from 22 (10.4%) of 211 aneurysms. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common organism recovered (12/22, 54%). Bacterial colonization of the arterial wall has a possible role in the pathophysiology of prosthetic graft sepsis. These data are valuable not only in choosing appropriate prophylactic antibiotics for aneurysm repair, but also in experimental efforts to develop an infection-resistant vascular graft by directing the antimicrobial characteristics of agents selected for binding to various prosthetic flow surfaces.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - CS-807 is a new oral prodrug of R-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to R-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. Ninety percent or more of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus spp., Providencia rettgeri, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to R-3746. The activity of R-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. R-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of R-3746 at concentrations above the MIC. R-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus and 1A, 1Bs, and 3 of Escherichia coli. Systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of CS-807.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa of 102 patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A microbiological analysis of 102 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis was conducted over a 22 month period. 20 microbial species with the following incidence were identified: Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 83.4%; Candida albicans: 29.4%; Staphylococcus aureus: 24.5%; Staphylococcus epidermidis: 11.8%; Haemophilus influenzae: 11.8%; Streptococcus pneumoniae; 6.9%; Pseudomonas maltophilia: 6.8%; Aspergillus fumigatus: 5.9%. Other species were present in less than 5% of the patients. In the majority of specimens with P. aeruginosa, more than one type (up to six) was detectable. These strains were identical in colony appearance, O-serotype and pyocin-type. Quantitative analysis revealed concentrations of colony-forming units of 10(7) to 10(9) for P. aeruginosa, 10(6) to 10(8) for P. maltophilia, 10(4) to 10(7) for S. aureus, 10(4) to 10(6) for S. epidermidis and 10(4) to 10(7) for C. albicans in the majority of specimens. Significant differences were observed in the time periods during which the pathogens persisted in the patients. Maximum persistence was observed for P. aeruginosa. P. maltophilia and A. fumigatus had about similar persistence rates, which were lower than those for P. aeruginosa but above those for S. aureus and H. influenzae. S. epidermidis was eliminated within shorter periods than S. aureus. C. albicans, although the second most frequent microorganism identified, showed a very low persistence rate. The microbiological analysis confirms results from other research centers (high incidence of P. aeruginosa), but reveals significant regional differences as well (Pseudomonas cepacia not detectable, higher incidence of P. maltophilia and C. albicans). This underlines the necessity for detailed qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa from cystic fibrosis patients as a prerequisite for rational analysis of etiological, epidemiological and therapeutical aspects of cystic fibrosis.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - In vitro activity of RO 23-6240 (AM-833): a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activities of RO 23-6240 (AM-833) and four comparative fluoroquinolones were studied. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of RO 23-6240, which inhibited at least 90% of strains, were less than or equal to 0.03-1 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter anitratus Aeromonas hydrophila, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae, 2-8 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococci, diphtheroids, and Pseudomonas spp., and 1-32 micrograms/ml for anaerobic species. MICs of ofloxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin paralleled those of RO 23-6240. With all five drugs, MICs were minimally affected by inoculum size and minimal bacterial concentrations (MBCs) were always within two dilution steps (log2) of MICs.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by middle ear macrophages.
AB  - Because macrophage dysfunction has been suggested as one of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for otitis media with effusion, we have examined macrophage-bacterial interactions using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-induced middle ear macrophages from chinchillas. Our data indicate that macrophages recruited to the middle ear were functional phagocytes capable of discriminate phagocytosis and intracellular killing of eight species of bacteria associated with otitis media, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. Streptococcus pneumoniae types 14 and 19F, which are associated with the highest relapse frequency in cases of acute otitis media, were the most resistant to phagocytosis. The two organisms most often involved in chronic otitis media (Staphylococcus epidermidis and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae), however, were among the most readily phagocytized isolates. The relative importance of macrophage function in defense of the middle ear, therefore, may be dependent on the causative agent.
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - A microbiological study of acute otitis media in Bloemfontein.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was done on 36 patients (57 ears) with acute otitis media. Positive cultures were obtained in 65% of cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated organism (25% of ears). There was a high incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (14% of ears); these organisms are considered to be true pathogens. Haemophilus influenzae seemed to be less common than in other series and in all our cases were non-producers of beta-lactamase. Penicillin and amoxycillin appeared to be equally effective and there seemed to be little difference between responses to cefaclor, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Microbiological perspectives of co-trimoxazole.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in vitro activity was compared with ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide and trimethoprim against isolates of 24 gram-negative and 11 gram-positive species. The incidence of more than 10% of strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations above 32 mg/l was restricted to Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Occasionally, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains with MICs above 32 mg/l were identified. Co-trimoxazole in vitro activity was superior to the comparative drugs for the majority of species. Co-trimoxazole remains an active combination against major pathogens of infections of the upper and lower respiratory, urinary tract and enteric infections with a still low incidence of resistant organisms.
TI  - Septicemia in a university pediatric hospital: a five-year analysis of the bacterial and fungal isolates and outcome of the infections.
AB  - A 5-year analysis comprising all positive blood culture isolates from a 222-bed university pediatric hospital in Helsinki revealed 369 bacteremic but only 8 fungemic cases. Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, 19% of the total material each, were the most common pathogens isolated, followed by S. epidermidis (11%), Escherichia coli (8%), pneumococci (8%), and group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (6%). Remarkable differences in distribution of the pathogens were observed in different hospital units. However, 5 most common microorganisms covered 62-86% of the spectrum in each unit. Two bacteria, H. influenzae in the unit for infectious diseases and S. aureus in the hematology-oncology unit were significantly (p less than 0.001 or less than 0.01, respectively) more common than any other organism in those units. The average case fatality rate was 14% with a range from 1.5% to 40%, depending upon the causative agent isolated. Also, the mortality was much higher in neonates than in other age groups. We conclude that by monitoring the blood isolates separately in each unit one can find remarkable differences in the same hospital. On the other hand, characteristics of an individual hospital may vary significantly from those described in textbooks. These characteristics should be recognized and taken into account in the antimicrobial policy.
TI  - The bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in healthy young men.
AB  - The nasal cavity of 97 young healthy men (applicants for the pilot education in the Finnish Air Force) was examined. Bacterial culture demonstrated one or more species of aerobic bacteria in all 194 nasal cavities examined and anaerobic bacteria in 76.5%. In ten per cent of the cultures bacteria were detected after enrichment only. The most common aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (79%), diphtheroids (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (34%). Haemophilus influenzae was found in 5% and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 0.5%. Anaerobic culture yielded Propionibacterium acnes in 74.5% and Peptococcus magnus in 3.5%.
TI  - The comparison of myocardial dysfunction in three forms of experimental septic shock.
AB  - A rabbit model of septic shock was used to determine if myocardial dysfunction is a common component of shock due to diverse neonatal pathogens, and prostaglandins modulate septic myocardial dysfunction. The infusion of heat-killed Escherichia coli (group I), Haemophilus influenzae (group II), or Staphylococcus epidermidis (group III) produced significant decreases in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure with respect to time (p less than 0.05). Each organism also produced significant changes in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate, while pulmonary artery pressure was altered in groups I and III. Saline-infused control animals (group IV) exhibited no significant changes in any hemodynamic variable. Blood gas variables were not significantly changed in any group. These cardiovascular changes appeared dependent on arachidonic acid metabolism since indomethacin pretreatment prevented the cardiovascular changes induced by bacterial infusion. These results suggest that septic myocardial dysfunction is a common component of gram-negative and gram-positive septic shock, and that myocardial dysfunction is modulated by prostaglandin products.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of A-56268 (TE-031), the 6-O-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. A-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. A-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and Propionibacterium acnes, for which A-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. The MBC of A-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the MIC against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and H. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the MICs for some Staphylococcus aureus strains. Human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of A-56268 or erythromycin. A-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being more active at pH 8.0 than at the physiologic pH of 7.3. The activity of A-56268 was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of H. influenzae. In mouse protection tests, when administered orally A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. After subcutaneous administration the potencies of A-56268 and erythromycin were not statistically different from each other. A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against Legionella infection in guinea pigs. The concentration of A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In mice, the peak levels in serum of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for A-56268 after oral administration. The serum half-life of A-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.
TI  - Acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Bacteriology and clinical implications.
AB  - We report the results of eye culture specimens, obtained from patients under 20 years of age, submitted to the Bacteriology Department of our institution from January 1 through April 30, 1983. A total of 72 specimens were positive for one or more strains of bacteria. The most commonly isolated bacteria was Hemophilus influenzae (34 strains, 42%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (11 strains, 13.75%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9 strains, 11.25%). Mean age of patients with H. influenzae (excluding a 20-year-old patient) was 15 months with standard deviation of 13 months. Chloramphenicol and tetracycline showed excellent in vitro activity against bacteria of all age groups. Tetracycline may prove to be the drug of choice for the treatment of acute conjunctivitis if comparative clinical data support its in vitro superiority.
TI  - Cefoperazone for empiric therapy in patients with impaired renal function.
AB  - Thirty-five patients with serious infections and impaired renal function were treated empirically with 2 to 8 g of cefoperazone per day. Infections included sepsis in 14, nonbacteremic urinary infections in nine, pneumonia in five, intra-abdominal infection in five, fasciitis in one, and malignant otitis externa in one. The average age of this group was 64.3 years, 25 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases, and their average serum creatinine level was 5.2 mg/dl. Infections were caused by Enterobacteriaceae in 23 patients, Streptococcus faecalis in five, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in four, Staphylococcus aureus in four, Hemophilus influenzae in three, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium sordelli in one each. Overall, 32 patients had clinical and microbiologic cures, two had improvement, and one had failure. Hypoprothrombinemia occurred in 18 of 28 patients not given vitamin K for prophylaxis and occurred more often in those with serum albumin concentrations below 3.5 g/dl. Prothrombin times returned to normal within 36 hours of treatment with vitamin K, although two patients experienced mild hematemesis. In anicteric patients with liver function abnormalities, 2 g every 12 hours produced peak and trough serum concentrations that averaged 254 and 125 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 179.5 and 19.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, in five with normal liver function test results. In jaundiced patients treated with 1 g every 12 hours, trough concentrations were comparably elevated. Serum concentrations did not correlate with hypoprothrombinemia, but high levels throughout the dosing interval may have contributed to the excellent cure rate in this study.
TI  - Effects of carbon dioxide upon the in vitro activity of erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae was examined by agar dilution and agar diffusion methods. The plates were incubated in air alone or in 8% CO2 and air. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) measured in air alone were lower for most of the isolates, compared to those found in 8% CO2. The greatest differences in MIC values were found for H. influenzae; the MIC 50% was 0.5 mg/l in air and 4 mg/l in 8% CO2. Sensitivity testing by the agar diffusion method (ICS) showed considerable differences between results obtained in air and in 8% CO2; the inhibition zones were generally smaller in CO2. The most marked reduction in zone sizes after incubation in 8% CO2 was seen with the H. influenzae isolates; 15 out of 43 isolates moved from the "sensitive" to "moderately sensitive" group. Sensitivity determination of aerobic bacteria for erythromycin should be performed in air alone in the routine laboratory.
TI  - [Treatment of neurosurgical bacterial meningitis using the combination of ceftriaxone-fosfomycin].
AB  - 16 patients with bacterial meningitis following a neurosurgical procedure were given a combination of ceftriaxone and fosfomycin. 8 microorganism were isolated: 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Neisseria meningitidis, 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Serratia marcescens and 1 Aeromonas hydrophila. No pathogen was identified in the remaining cases. All of the isolated strains were susceptible to both antibiotics. In vitro, neither synergy nor antagonism were observed between the two antimicrobial agents. The acute infectious episode resolved in all patients. One relapse only was observed, in a patient with meningitis related to a ventricular shunt, and successfully treated by the same therapeutic schedule associated with removal of the tubing. Lastly, CSF concentrations of both antibiotics were assayed and found to be comparable with those reported by most author.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. There were five types of infections. Infections commonly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections commonly associated with a B-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. Other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed S. aureus and group G streptococcus. Other infections occurring out of the hospital included those with S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group B streptococcus. Because two thirds of the septicemias were caused by organisms other than T-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid shunt.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid shunt  has been reported uncommonly. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the most common etiological agents, are usually acquired by contiguous spread from an intraoperative or perioperative source. These infections usually occur within 2 months of shunt insertion and are rarely associated with bacteremia. Review of the literature shows that infection with H. influenzae typically occurs later than with the more common pathogens, is commonly associated with bacteremia, and frequently can be treated with antibiotics alone.
TI  - [Therapeutic activity of Oriprim in bronchopulmonary diseases].
AB  - A new chemotherapeutic drug oriprim was used for therapy of 36 patients with bronchopulmonary pathology. Its therapeutic efficacy was noted in 83.3% of the cases. In 6 patients oriprim therapy turned out to be ineffective as a result of early side-effects. The drug was effective in pneumococcal infection. In suspicion of anaerobic infection (B. fragilis, etc) oriprim was given in combination with metronidazole.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against some selected gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were tested against five selected groups of clinical bacterial isolates. Both were active against: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, irrespective of their resistance to methicillin or gentamicin; Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, irrespective of their beta-lactamase production; members of the Enterobacteriaceae family which were resistant to most oral beta-lactams, and most intestinal bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter, Vibrio, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia. Ciprofloxacin was found more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas with most isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens susceptible, while those of Pseudomonas cepacia were resistant.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - A bacteriological study of the middle ear and upper respiratory tract in children with chronic secretory otitis media.
AB  - Middle ear effusions and swabs from the external auditory meatus, nasopharynx and anterior nares have been collected from 100 children with chronic secretory otitis media. Isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were typed and in vitro sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics were determined for these species and Staphylococcus aureus. Positive middle ear cultures were obtained from 21 children (27 effusions). Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the commonest organisms isolated, both from the middle ear and upper respiratory tract. When one or other of these species was isolated from the middle ear, the same organism was generally found in the upper respiratory tract, but not in the ear canal. The serotypes isolated from the different sites were also the same. Type 19 was the commonest Pneumococcal serotype isolated, while type e was the commonest capsulated strain of H. influenzae. Thirty-six per cent of strains of H. influenzae were resistant to penicillin and 25% of those of S. pneumoniae were resistant to trimethaprim. Eighty-one per cent of isolates of S. aureus were penicillin resistant. There was no difference in the incidence of either S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae in the post nasal spaces of children who had had their adenoids removed and those who had not.
TI  - Microbiology of recently treated acute otitis media compared with previously untreated acute otitis media.
AB  - Isolates were obtained from 169 middle ear aspirates of 148 children with recently treated acute otitis media (RTOM) and from 123 aspirates of 84 children with previously untreated acute otitis media (UOM). In RTOM Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group A streptococcus (P less than 0.02) were recovered less frequently whereas Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.001) and Haemophilus influenzae (P less than 0.02) were recovered more frequently than in UOM. Patients with RTOM had more beta-lactamase-producing organisms and multiple isolates. Bilateral sterile aspirates were more common in RTOM although bilateral otitis media was more common in UOM. In RTOM most Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were co-pathogens whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis were always isolated in pure culture. Amoxicillin was the antimicrobial most frequently (83.9%) received for the recently treated episode of otitis media. In RTOM 62.4% of isolates were susceptible to previously prescribed antibiotics, suggesting that factors other than antimicrobial susceptibility are also important in the occurrence of RTOM.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - Comparative in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of flurithromycin by means of the MS-2 Abbott Research System.
AB  - The study reports the results of an in vitro comparative evaluation of flurithromycin by means of MS-2 research system analyzing the growth curve patterns of recently isolated strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. faecalis and H. influenzae. Flurithromycin is provided with superior activity to that of josamycin and practically superimposed on that of erythromycin. Of the 4 bacterial species studied, S. faecalis is the most sensitive, followed by Staphylococci and H. influenzae in decreasing order of sensitivity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of mupirocin (pseudomonic acid), a new antibiotic for topical use.
AB  - Mupirocin (pseudomonic acid A), an antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens, showed a high level of activity against staphylococci and streptococci and against certain gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was much less active against most gram-negative bacilli an anaerobes. Nearly all clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains, were susceptible (mupirocin MIC, less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml). There was no cross-resistance between mupirocin and clinically available antibiotics, and the selection of resistant variants in vitro occurred at a low frequency. Mupirocin was highly bound (95% bound) to the protein of human serum, and activity was reduced 10- to 20-fold in the presence of human serum. The activity of mupirocin was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was significantly enhanced in acid medium. In tests of bactericidal activity, MBCs were 8- to 32-fold higher than MICs and the antibiotic demonstrated a slow bactericidal action in time-kill tests, resulting in 90 to 99% killing after 24 h at 37 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 48 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. Eighty-two aerobic and 93 anaerobic isolates were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were involved in 22 patients (46%), and anaerobic organisms only were involved in five patients (10%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 21 patients (44%). The most common bacteria isolated were Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (40% of patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). There were 50 beta-lactamase-producing organisms (26 anaerobes and 24 aerobes) recovered from 33 patients (69%). Forty-four of these bacteria were isolated from the 37 patients recently treated with a penicillin. These included all ten isolates of S aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group, 11 of 19 of B melaninogenicus group, five of the 14 P aeruginosa, three of ten K pneumoniae, three of six of Bacteroides oralis, four of six of Haemophilus influenzae, two of three of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and two of four of Branhamella catarrhalis. The beta-lactamase-producing organisms have a possible role in the failure of penicillin therapy.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Cefotaxime monotherapy of bacterial meningitis caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Primary meningitis in children is caused by two gram-negative bacterial species,  Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, and one gram-positive bacterial species Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite optimal penicillin susceptibility, with few exceptions, therapeutic results in pneumococcal meningitis are by far worse than with the other two pathogens. Therefore, and because of the detection of penicillin-resistant rods, the study of alternatives in therapy is justified and was started with cefotaxime. Including six of our own patients, there are reports on 87 patients in the literature suffering from S. pneumoniae meningitis who were treated with cefotaxime monotherapy. Results of these studies will be analyzed. As none of these patients belonged to a prospective controlled study group, final evaluation in comparison with penicillin therapy remains open. There are also several reports on successful treatment of group B streptococcus meningitis with cefotaxime, although there is no need to abandon penicillin therapy. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis, usually secondary in shunted hydrocephalus, brain tumors, brain injury or other causes, should not be treated with cefotaxime because of its limited activity on these bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus faecalis are primarily cefotaxime-resistant, and neonatal meningitis of unknown origin, therefore, should not be treated with cefotaxime alone as long as these pathogens cannot be excluded.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - A microbiological study of secretory otitis media using an anaerobic technique.
AB  - A serious anaerobic sampling and cultivation technique was used in order to obtain representative samples from 45 middle ear effusions in 30 patients with longstanding secretory otitis media (SOM). Despite the fact that an accurate sterilizing procedure was performed, 16% disclosed contaminated samples from the ear canal and tympanic membrane. Among the remaining samples, middle ear bacteria were found in 30% of which Staphylococcus epidermidis and Haemophilus influenzae contributed to the major part. Anaerobes were only occasionally found. The amount of bacteria found was sparse in all cases. It can be concluded that the inflammatory process in SOM is not maintained by anaerobic bacteria within the middle ear cavity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). Susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass., and the Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, New York, N.Y., were compared. Strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year period, whereas Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. The close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in U.S. hospitals. Since most of the species analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.
TI  - In vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  - A review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. An evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean MIC90 being less than 8 mg/l. The MIC90 for cocci, with the exception of Staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. The MIC90 for all Enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic resistance. Imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the MIC usually being below 1 mg/l even for Bacteroides fragilis. Rare bacteria such as Nocardia asteroides, Listeria monocytogenes or fast growing Mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. Increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. In most species the MBC only slightly exceeded the MIC; however in the case of Streptococcus faecalis the MBC value was many times the MIC value. Synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. Imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. Induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Enoxacin: worldwide in-vitro activity against 22451 clinical isolates.
AB  - A worldwide multicentre study involving 31 centres in eight countries was conducted to compare the in-vitro activity of enoxacin with that of other currently available antibiotics. Enoxacin was active against virtually all of the species of Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.25-2 mg/l). It was also effective at inhibiting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 2 mg/l; n = 3540), Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis (MIC90 = 2 mg/l; n = 2635 and 837 resp.), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC90 = 4 mg/l; n = 260), Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (both MIC90 less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l). The MIC90 for enoxacin against streptococci ranged from 8 to 32 mg/l. Comparison of data from Canada, West Germany, U.K., South Africa and New Zealand showed the MICs for enoxacin to be generally consistent throughout the world. The only exception was for Citrobacter freundii where the MIC90 was significantly higher in the U.K. than in West Germany (P less than 0.05 Mann Whitney U Test). Against susceptible species the activity of enoxacin was generally greater than that of ampicillin, gentamicin and the cephalosporins. Because of the prevalence of resistance to these drugs, there appears to be a continued need for new antibiotics with differing mechanisms of action.
TI  - Multiple pulmonary complications in a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
AB  - Since first described in 1922, Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been associated frequently with pneumonia of many etiologies. This "mucosal respiratory syndrome," first reported by Stanyon and Warner in 1945, is associated with "early" pneumonia which resolves 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the rash. In our patient, pneumonia began 10 days after rash onset and was nearly resolved by day 20. The unique feature of this case was the onset of late pulmonary complications 25 days after the appearance of the exanthem, manifesting as acute noninfectious interstitial disease with superimposed airway obstruction.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - Rapid detection of beta-lactamase by PADAC test strip.
AB  - A total of 967 isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by the PADAC test strip, and the results were compared with acidometric, disk diffusion and antibiotic dilution procedures. All the penicillinase producting strains of gonococci (23) and Haemophilus influenzae (36) gave positive results with PADAC, but the 361 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis remained negative. All of the 547 strains of penicillin sensitive strains of gonococci, Haemophilus and staphylococci were negative with PADAC test.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We set out to determine the frequency of occurrence of contamination of cerebrospinal fluid with bacteria, seeking also to identify aids to differentiating contaminants from etiologically significant isolates. From 2,091 specimens, 182 bacterial isolates were obtained from 129 patients. Meningitis was the source of 81 isolates (32 patients); contamination yielded 101 isolates (97 patients). The cell counts and protein and glucose concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were significantly more often abnormal in specimens from patients with meningitis. Haemophilus influenzae and enteric gram-negative bacilli were usually cause for meningitis, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common contaminant. In view of the reported high rate of procedural error in carrying out lumbar puncture, a program aimed at teaching proper technique is recommended to decrease the frequency of false-positive cultures of cerebrospinal fluid.
TI  - Evaluation of three 4"-deoxy-4"-sulfonamido-oleandomycin derivatives with erythromycin-like antibacterial potency.
AB  - Three derivatives of oleandomycin in which the C"-4 hydroxyl moiety was replaced  for the first time with a nitrogen functionality have been compared with erythromycin base and oleandomycin base. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of these derivatives for 90% of a group of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were one-half to one-fourth those of erythromycin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the experimental macrolides for 50% of a group of S. aureus isolates resistant to greater than 12.5 micrograms of erythromycin per ml ranged from 0.2 to 0.39 micrograms/ml. The activities of these experimental compounds were equivalent to the activities of erythromycin against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Haemophilus influenzae isolates. In general, erythromycin was more active against Streptococcus species. Each experimental macrolide was superior to erythromycin in inhibiting RNA-directed, cell-free polypeptide synthesis. The three experimental compounds were markedly more active than erythromycin base after oral administration to mice infected with S. aureus. The 50% protective doses of the experimental compounds ranged from 27.4 to 45.7 mg/kg; that of erythromycin was approximately 100 mg/kg.
TI  - Recognition and clinical significance of mechanisms of bacterial resistance to beta-lactams.
AB  - Resistance to beta-lactams may be difficult to recognize. This is due to the difficulty in detecting these resistances, when the routine tests performed in diagnostic laboratories are interpreted in the usual manner. Since failure to recognize this type of resistance may have serious consequences for the patient, it is essential that it be detected when present. For the detection of methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus a standardized method using either a medium containing 5% NaCl or a low incubation temperature is advocated. Methicillin resistance of S. epidermidis can only be recognized reliably by means of a quantitative test and incubation for 42-48 h. Resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin may be intrinsic or it may be caused by a TEM beta-lactamase; a beta-lactamase test should be used to detect the latter type of resistance. Inducible cephalosporinase may be responsible for the rapid development of resistance of some bacterial species to cefamandole, even during therapy. If a stable beta-lactamase production is attained by mutation, resistance to other beta-lactams will usually be present as well. Routine induction tests should be performed for all isolates of species of Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter and Proteus, indole-positive. The same type of 'hidden' resistance may be present in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with regard to cefotaxime and other third-generation cephalosporins. Beta-lactamase-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae can easily be recognized by a beta-lactamase test. In addition, the results of diffusion tests allow one to distinguish between beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains. Recognition of those strains of N. gonorrhoeae having a decreased susceptibility to penicillin is only possible when well-standardized quantitative tests are used.
TI  - Detection of beta lactamase producing bacteria by Cefinase: comparison with three other methods.
AB  - Nine hundred and sixty-seven strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria  were tested for the production of beta lactamase by Cefinase and the results were compared with acidometric microtiter, disc diffusion and antibiotic dilution procedures. A total of 420 strains of bacteria had a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of more than 2.0 micrograms/ml for penicillins. They consisted of 23 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 36 of Haemophilus influenzae, 188 of Staphylococcus aureus and 173 strains of S. epidermidis. All the penicillin resistant strains gave positive results for beta-lactamase with Cefinase and acidometric method within 60 min. All the 547 strains of penicillin sensitive bacteria (MIC less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) were negative for beta-lactamase production by both methods.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  - Aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). A total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). There were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including Hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and Staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). Fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and Propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Rapidity of C-reactive protein in detecting potential septicemia.
AB  - Eight episodes of clinical septicemia in five children were assessed using C-reactive protein (CRP) determinations. The measurements were performed turbidimetrically, with quantitative results available in less than 10 minutes. Three patients had epiglottitis, one had recurrent septicemia secondary to severe underlying illnesses and one patient was followed postoperatively after open heart surgery. Regardless of etiology septicemia was consistently associated with a rapid increase (greater than or equal to 20 to 214 mg/liter) in the CRP concentration. Elevated values were obtained 5, 13 and 16 hours after the onset of symptoms of epiglottitis. When determined the CRP level was invariably elevated at the time of the first positive blood culture. CRP determinations in patients with symptoms of septicemia would have supported the diagnosis at least 24 hours before the positive blood culture. In addition, sequential CRP measurements proved beneficial in monitoring the course of septicemia.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - A controlled trial of cefaclor versus amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in early infancy.
AB  - Optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. We studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double blind comparative trial. Infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. Clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. Pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included Streptococcus pneumoniae (14), Haemophilus influenzae type b (5), H. influenzae nontypeable (3), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Branhamella sp. (2), and Streptococcus pyogenes (1). Nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included Streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and Streptococcus viridans. Two aspirates were sterile. A satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of 19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. We conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.
TI  - Aetiology and treatment of acute bacterial infection of the external eye.
AB  - The microbial flora of 738 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal  ulceration, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, and discharging sockets has been investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the main pathogens isolated. Str. viridans was associated with conjunctivitis in patients aged under 1 year. moraxella sp. was isolated on only one occasion. Overall, 40% of specimens were associated with Staph. epidermidis or mixed skin flora, which also occurred with cultures of the normal eye. Clostridium welchii was isolated on 3 occasions but was not associated with bullae or gas gangrene. The least overall resistance, of 6%, was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Gentamicin remains the antibiotic of choice for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - Experimental otitis media in gerbils and chinchillas with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - To ascertain the usefulness of Mongolian gerbils as an inbred model for otitis media, 52 Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus, strain MONT/Tum) were compared with 26 chinchillas (Chinchilla laniger) for susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3. Haemophilus influenzae type b, and a polymicrobic culture including anaerobes (Streptococcus intermedius, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium sp.). Organisms were inoculated percutaneously into the superior chamber of the middle ear bulla. The gerbils and chinchillas shared similar susceptibilities and responses to the inoculated organisms as determined by X-ray, otoscopic, histopathological, and microbiological determinations at 5 to 7 days. Koch's postulate studies proved the role of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the pathology found in both animal models. The animals were also susceptible to the polymicrobic culture, although the relative virulence of the individual members of this mixture was low, suggesting that these species potentiated as a polymicrobic mixture. The Corynebacterium sp. appeared to elicit the greatest histopathological response in chronic (8-week) studies in gerbils. The gerbils were found to be useful as an alternative animal model for the study of otitis media of bacterial etiology.
TI  - The bacteriology and cytology of chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  - The bacteriology and cytology of middle ear effusion from 729 children with persistent otitis media with effusion were studied. Thirty-five percent of these chronic effusions were culture-positive. Type b and non-type b Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant isolates. Serous and mucoid effusion cultures yielded bacteria more often in younger than in older children. In addition bacteria were seen in 17% of the Gram-stained smears of the sterile effusions; Gram-positive cocci predominated in these effusions. Disparate effusion culture results were obtained in 32% of bilateral otitis media cases. Effusions which yielded H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae on culture had more polymorphonuclear leukocytes than did effusions which yielded S. epidermidis or Neisseria or were sterile. Phagocytic cells were equally prevalent in sterile effusions with or without bacteria on Gram stain. Phagocytic cells were seen less often in mucoid effusions from antibiotic-treated patients than in mucoid effusions from untreated patients. The results suggest that certain bacteria in chronic middle ear effusion contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition by eliciting a local inflammatory cell response.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the rapid penicillinase paper strip test for detection of beta-lactamase.
AB  - The penicillin-starch paper strip method was compared with the acidometric and iodometric methods for assaying beta-lactamase production, using fresh isolates of clinically important bacteria. Results obtained by the three methods were compared for rapidity, accuracy, and stability of reagents. Of the 210 isolates tested by the paper strip method, 301 isolates tested by the acidometric method, and 117 isolates tested by the iodometric method, all were in perfect agreement with the disk diffusion susceptibility test except one strain each of Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The H. influenzae isolate was penicillin resistant and failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase in all three tests. The staphylococci (intermediate and resistant in susceptibility, respectively) failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase with the iodometric method. The results of the paper strip method, in which 3,241 strains representing nine species of bacteria were used, correlated completely with disk susceptibility tests except for 2 and 69 strains, respectively, of penicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-negative H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae. The results of this study indicate that the paper strip method is accurate, simple to perform, extremely economical, and uses materials that are stable when stored frozen. It is eminently suitable for routine laboratory use.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Antibody coated bacteria in otitis media with effusions.
AB  - The significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. Cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. Isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. Furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. The results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. There is some evidence that specific IgM and IgG as well as IgA responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. These results suggest that coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. Whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. One very interesting point is the presence of IgF coating of organisms in some effusions.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - The microbiology of serous and mucoid otitis media.
AB  - One hundred forty-four serous and mucoid effusions were cultured for aerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and virus. Thirty percent of all effusions yielded an unequivocally positive culture for aerobic bacteria. Although serous effusions were culture positive as often as mucoid effusions, Haemophilus influenzae was isolated predominantly from serous effusions and Staphylococcus epidermidis predominantly from mucoid samples. Only one of 73 effusions yielded a viral isolate (Herpesvirus hominis). None of 33 effusions yielded M pneumoniae, and only one of 17 effusions yielded an anaerobe (Propionibacterium). These findings suggest that aerobic bacteria may play a role in the pathogensis of serous and mucoid otitis media.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - A rapid slide test for penicillinase.
AB  - The authors developed a rapid slide test modification of the iodometric method for detection of penicillinase produced by organisms growing on routine plating media. A loopful of colonies is scraped from the agar surface and emulsified in one drop of an iodine-penicillin solution on a glass slide. Addition of a drop of 0.4% starch solution results in a purple color when penicillinase is not present; a colorless reaction denotes a positive test. The slide test yielded positive results identical to those of a starch agar-plate method with 26 Staphylococcus aureus isolates; a further seven showed comparable negative tests. Penicillinase production was associated with a S. aureus penicillin MIC of greater than or equal to 0.5 micron/ml. All 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates gave negative test results, as did 22 Bacteroides fragilis (MIC greater than or equal to 3.1). Twenty ampicillin-susceptible Haemophilus influenzae were negative by both the slide test and a Levinthal broth method; an additional five resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 10) isolates were positive by both methods. Twenty-eight (penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 0.8) of 50 Bacteroides melaninogenicus were slide test-positive for penicillinase. Two penicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae gave positive slide tests, while eight other non-penicillinase-producers were negative.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
