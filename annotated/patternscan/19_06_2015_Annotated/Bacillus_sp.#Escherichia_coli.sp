TI  == soluble expression of (+)-gamma-lactamase in bacillus subtilis for the enantioselective preparation of abacavir precursor.
AB  == chiral vince lactam (gamma-lactam) is an important precursor of many carbocyclic  nucleoside analogues and pharmaceuticals. here, a (+)-gamma-lactamase encoding gene delm from delftia sp. cgmcc 5755 was identified through genome hunting. to achieve its soluble and functional expression, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis expression systems were introduced. compared with e. coli system, recombinant (+)-gamma-lactamase showed improved protein solubility and catalytic  activity in b. subtilis 168. reaction conditions for enantioselective resolution  of gamma-lactam were optimized to be at 30 degrees c, ph 9.0, and 300 rpm when employing the recombinant b. subtilis 168/pma5-delm whole cells. kinetic analysis showed that the apparent v max and k m were 0.595 mmol/(min . gdcw) and 378 mmol/l, respectively. no obvious substrate inhibition was observed. in a 500-ml reaction system, enantioselective resolution of 100 g/l gamma-lactam was achieved with 10 g/l dry cells, resulting in 55.2 % conversion and 99 % ee of (-)-gamma-lactam. all above suggested that recombinant b. subtilis 168/pma5-delm  could potentially be applied in the preparation of optically pure (-)-gamma-lactam.

TI  == identification of a heterologous cellulase and its n-terminus that can guide recombinant proteins out of escherichia coli.
AB  == background: the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli has been widely used as  a cell factory for the production of proteins and specialty chemicals because it  is the best characterized host with many available expression and regulation systems. however, recombinant proteins produced in escherichia coli are generally intracellular and often found in the form of inclusion bodies. extracellular production of proteins is advantageous compared with intracellular production because extracellular proteins can be purified more easily and can avoid protease attack, which results in higher product quality. in this study, we found a catalytic domain of a cellulase (cel-cd) and its n-terminus can be employed as carriers for extracellular production of recombinant proteins. results: in this report, we identified the catalytic domain of a cellulase (cel-cd) from bacillus  sp. that can be secreted into the medium from recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) in large quantities without its native signal peptide. by subcellular location analysis, we proved that the secretion was a two-step process and the n-terminal  sequence of the full length cel-cd played a crucial function in secretion. both the cel-cd and its n-terminal sequence can serve as carriers for efficient extracellular production of select target proteins. conclusions: fusion of heterologous proteins with n20 from cel-cd can carry the target proteins out of the cells with a concentration from 101 to 691 mg/l in flask cultivation. the extracellular recombinant proteins with a relative high purity. the results suggested that this system has a potential application in plant biomass conversion and industrial production of enzymes and therapeutic proteins.

TI  == a rapid and miniaturized method for the selection of microbial phenol degraders using colourimetric microtitration.
AB  == a high-throughput method is described, consisting of a colourimetric microtitration for screening phenol-degrading microorganisms, using a mixture of  4-aminoantipyrine and potassium ferricyanide as the colour indicator. this contemporary study summarizes a new method to determine phenol-degrading bacteria isolated from different areas. the method was used for testing a total of 72 bacteria collected from the natural environment and five known strains obtained from diagnostic and research laboratories employing 200 mg/l phenol (the linear range saturation concentration). depending on the change in colour indicator, the degradation profiles of 11 strains of bacteria are shown, of which seven strains  were able to degrade more than 80 % of phenol within 6-8 h, while the other four  strains took 12-24 h. two of the environmentally isolated strains showed high efficiency of phenol degradation and were confirmed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. these strains were identified by 16s rrna sequencing as unique (escherichia coli moh1 and bacillus cereus moh2) and were deposited in the genbank of ncbi. two pathogenic strains (uropathogenic e. coli and salmonella sp.) were found to be the fast degraders of phenol, which is of medical concern, as phenol is generally used as a disinfectant in hospitals. this method can be used for the estimation and screening of phenol degraders in a single step, for its application in bioremediation as well as in hospitals for screening the phenol resistance of pathogens.

TI  == functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the south china sea.
AB  == phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. in this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different  marine sponge species in the south china sea using five different culture media.  eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and  grouped into 13 genera, including actinoalloteichus, kocuria, micrococcus, micromonospora, mycobacterium, nocardiopsis, prauserella, rhodococcus, saccharopolyspora, salinispora, serinicoccus, and streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene. based on the screening of phze genes, ten strains, including five streptomyces, two nocardiopsis, one salinispora, one micrococcus, and one serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. the level of phze gene expression was highly expressed in nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on esi-ms and nmr analysis. the compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against bacillus mycoides sj14, staphylococcus aureus sj51, escherichia coli sj42, and micrococcus luteus sj47. this study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.

TI  == properties of a newly identified esterase from bacillus sp. k91 and its novel function in diisobutyl phthalate degradation.
AB  == the widely used plasticizer phthalate esters (paes) have become a public concern  because of their effects on environmental contamination and toxicity on mammals.  however, the biodegradation of paes, especially diisobutyl phthalate (dibp), remains poorly understood. in particular, genes involved in the hydrolysis of these compounds were not conclusively identified. in this study, the carew gene,  which encodes an enzyme that is capable of hydrolyzing rho-nitrophenyl esters of  fatty acids, was cloned from a thermophilic bacterium bacillus sp. k91 and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli bl21 using the peasy-e2 expression system. the enzyme showed a monomeric structure with a molecular mass of approximately 53.76 kda and pi of 4.88. the enzyme exhibited maximal activity at  ph 7.5 and 45 degrees c, with rho-np butyrate as the best substrate. the enzyme was fairly stable within the ph range from 7.0 to 8.5. high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) were employed to detect the catabolic pathway of dibp. two intermediate products were  identified, and a potential biodegradation pathway was proposed. altogether, our  findings present a novel dibp degradation enzyme and indicate that the purified enzyme may be a promising candidate for dibp detoxification and for environmental protection.

TI  == identification of novel endophenaside antibiotics produced by kitasatospora sp. mbt66.
AB  == actinomycetes are a major source of bioactive secondary metabolites and are a focal point in the search for novel antimicrobial compounds that are needed to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens. here, we report the discovery of several novel phenazine-type antibiotics produced by kitasatospora sp. mbt66. these include the novel glycosylated endophenazines a-e (1-5), together with n-prenylated endophenazine f1 (6). compounds 1 and 3 contain a 2'-o-methylation of the sugar moiety, which is rare in nature and reported for the first time in connection with phenazines. the structures of the new compounds were determined on the basis of their spectral data, including 1d and 2d nmr, hr-ms and the gene  cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of phenazines was identified. all phenazine derivatives showed antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacillus subtilis, while compounds 1-3 and 5 also inhibited growth of the gram-negative escherichia coli.the journal of antibiotics advance online publication, 18 february 2015; doi:10.1038/ja.2015.14.

TI  == characterization of salt-tolerant beta-glucosidase with increased thermostability under high salinity conditions from bacillus sp. sj-10 isolated from jeotgal, a traditional korean fermented seafood.
AB  == the beta-glucosidase gene, bglc, was cloned from bacillus sp. sj-10 isolated from the squid jeotgal. recombinant bglc protein overexpression was induced in escherichia coli. the optimal ph and temperature of the enzyme, using p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pnpbetaglc) as a substrate, were ph 6 and 40 degrees c, respectively. enzymatic activity increased by 3.3- and 3.5-fold in  the presence of 15 % nacl and kcl, respectively. furthermore, enzyme thermostability improved in the presence of nacl or kcl. at 45 degrees c in the presence of salts, the enzyme was stable for 2 h and maintained 80 % activity. in the absence of salts, bglc completely lost activity after 110 min at 45 degrees c. comparison of the kinetic parameters at various salt concentrations revealed that bglc had approximately 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher affinity and hydrolyzed pnpbetaglc 1.9- and 2.1-fold faster in the presence of 15 % nacl and kcl, respectively. additionally, the gibb's free energy for denaturation was higher in the presence of 15 % salt than in the absence of salt at 45 and 50 degrees c. since enzymatic activity and thermostability were enhanced under high salinity conditions, bglc is an ideal salt-tolerant enzyme for further research and industrial applications.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == purification and identification of an antibacterial protein from the symbiotic bacteria associated with novel entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp.
AB  == entomopathogenic nematodes (epn) belonging to the families steinernematidae and heterorhabditidae and their symbiotic bacteria xenorhabdus and photorhabdus are well-known as biological control agents and are found to produce a wide range of  bioactive secondary metabolites. studies carried out at the central tuber crops research institute (ctcri) on entomopathogenic nematodes resulted in the identification of novel epn belonging to the family rhabditidae. this study reports the purification of a high molecular weight antibacterial protein from culture filtrates of a bacterium (bacillus cereus) symbiotically associated with  a novel entomopathogenic nematode rhabditis (oscheius) species, maintained at ctcri laboratory. fermentation conditions were standardized and optimum antibacterial activity was observed in tryptic soy broth after 48 h incubation at 30 degrees c. the aqueous extracts yielded antibacterial proteins which were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. native gel electrophoresis indicated an active protein of molecular mass 220kda which resolved into a major  band of 90 kda and a minor band of about 40 kda on sds-page. the 90 kda protein showed antibacterial activity and was further analysed by maldi tof-ms/ms. the protein was identified as a tqxa (threonine-glutamine dipeptide) domain containing protein from bacillus cereus. the protein was found to be active against bacillus subtilis mtcc2756, staphylococus aureus mtcc902 and escherichia  coli mtcc 2622 and was thermally stable.

TI  == development of a chimeric hemicellulase to enhance the xylose production and thermotolerance.
AB  == xylan is an abundant plant cell wall polysaccharide and its reduction to xylose units for subsequent biotechnological applications requires a combination of distinct hemicellulases and auxiliary enzymes, mainly endo-xylanases and ss-xylosidases. in the present work, a bifunctional enzyme consisting of a gh11 endo-1,4-beta-xylanase fused to a gh43 beta-xylosidase, both from bacillus subtilis, was designed taking into account the quaternary arrangement and accessibility to the substrate. the parental enzymes and the resulting chimera were successfully expressed in escherichia coli, purified and characterized. interestingly, the substrate cleavage rate was altered by the molecular fusion improving at least 3-fold the xylose production using specific substrates as beechwood xylan and hemicelluloses from pretreated biomass. moreover, the chimeric enzyme showed higher thermotolerance with a positive shift of the optimum temperature from 35 to 50 degrees c for xylosidase activity. this improvement in the thermal stability was also observed by circular dichroism unfolding studies, which seems to be related to a gain of stability of the beta-xylosidase domain. these results demonstrate the superior functional and stability properties of the chimeric enzyme in comparison to individual parental  domains, suggesting the molecular fusion as a promising strategy for enhancing enzyme cocktails aiming at lignocellulose hydrolysis.

TI  == extracellular overexpression of chitosanase from bacillus sp. ts in escherichia coli.
AB  == the chitosanase gene from a bacillus sp. strain isolated from soil in east china  was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the gene had 1224 nucleotides and encoded a mature protein of 407 amino acid residues. the optimum ph and temperature of the purified recombinant chitosanase were 5.0 and 60 degrees c, respectively, and the enzyme was stable below 40 degrees c. the k m, v max, and specific activity of the enzyme were 1.19 mg ml(-1), 674.71 mumol min(-1) at 50 degrees c, and 555.3 u mg(-1), respectively. mn(2+) was an activator of the recombinant chitosanase, while co(2+) was an inhibitor. hg(2+) and cu(2+) inhibited the enzyme at 1 mm. the highest level of enzyme activity (186 u ml(-1)) was achieved in culture medium using high cell-density cultivation in a 7-l fermenter. the main products of chitosan hydrolyzed by recombinant chitosanase were (glcn)3-6. the chitosanases was successfully secreted to the culture media through the widely used secb-dependent type ii pathway in e. coli. the high yield of the extracellular overexpression, relevant thermostability, and effective hydrolysis of commercial grade chitosan showed that this recombinant enzyme had a great potential for industrial applications.

TI  == genetic and genomic analysis of rnases in model cyanobacteria.
AB  == cyanobacteria are diverse photosynthetic microbes with the ability to convert co2 into useful products. however, metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria remains challenging because of the limited resources for modifying the expression of endogenous and exogenous biochemical pathways. fine-tuned control of protein production will be critical to optimize the biological conversion of co2 into desirable molecules. messenger rnas (mrnas) are labile intermediates that play critical roles in determining the translation rate and steady-state protein concentrations in the cell. the majority of studies on mrna turnover have focused on the model heterotrophic bacteria escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. these studies have elucidated many rna modifying and processing enzymes and have highlighted the differences between these gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. in contrast, much less is known about mrna turnover in cyanobacteria. we generated a compendium of the major ribonucleases (rnases) and  provide an in-depth analysis of rnase iii-like enzymes in commonly studied and diverse cyanobacteria. furthermore, using targeted gene deletion, we genetically  dissected the rnases in synechococcus sp. pcc 7002, one of the fastest growing and industrially attractive cyanobacterial strains. we found that all three cyanobacterial homologs of rnase iii and a member of the rnase ii/r family are not essential under standard laboratory conditions, while homologs of rnase e/g,  rnase j1/j2, pnpase, and a different member of the rnase ii/r family appear to be essential for growth. this work will enhance our understanding of native control  of gene expression and will facilitate the development of an rna-based toolkit for metabolic engineering in cyanobacteria.

TI  == crosstalk between the microbiome and cancer cells by quorum sensing peptides.
AB  == to date, the precise role of the human microbiome in health and disease states remains largely undefined. complex and selective crosstalk systems between the microbiome and mammalian cells are also not yet reported. research up till now mainly focused on bacterial synthesis of virulence factors, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ros/rns) and hydrogen sulphide, as well as on the activation of exogenous mutagen precursors by intestinal bacteria. we discovered  that certain quorum sensing peptides, produced by bacteria, interact with mammalian cells, in casu cancer cells: phr0662 (bacillus sp.), entf-metabolite (enterococcus faecium) and edf-derived (escherichia coli) peptides initiate hct-8/e11 colon cancer cell invasion, with phr0662 also promoting angiogenesis. our findings thus indicate that the human microbiome, through their quorum sensing peptides, may be one of the factors responsible for cancer metastasis.

TI  == a halotolerant thermostable lipase from the marine bacterium oceanobacillus sp. pumb02 with an ability to disrupt bacterial biofilms.
AB  == a halotolerant thermostable lipase was purified and characterized from the marine bacterium oceanobacillus sp. pumb02. this lipase displayed a high degree of stability over a wide range of conditions including ph, salinity, and temperature. it was optimally active at 30 degrees c and ph 8.0 respectively and  was stable at higher temperatures (50-70 degrees c) and alkaline ph. the molecular mass of the lipase was approximately 31 kda based on sds-page and maldi-tof fingerprint analysis. conditions for enhanced production of lipase by oceanobacillus sp. pumb02 were attained in response surface method-guided optimization with factors such as olive oil, sucrose, potassium chromate, and nacl being evaluated, resulting in levels of 58.84 u/ml being achieved. the biofilm disruption potential of the pumb02 lipase was evaluated and compared with a marine sponge metagenome derived halotolerant lipase lpc53e1. good biofilm disruption activity was observed with both lipases against potential food pathogens such as bacillus cereus mtcc1272, listeria sp. mtcc1143, serratia sp. mtcc4822, escherichia coli mtcc443, pseudomonas fluorescens mtcc1748, and vibrio  parahemolyticus mtcc459. phase contrast microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed very effective disruption of pathogenic biofilms. this study reveals that marine derived hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases may have potential utility in inhibiting biofilm formation in a food processing environment and is the first report of the potential application  of lipases from the genus oceanobacillus in biofilm disruption strategies.

TI  == chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of schinus terebinthifolius raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  == the essential oil (eo) composition of ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi was analyzed by gc-ms. the oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). the major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. the antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella oxytoca, corynebacterium sp., staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus sp., nocardia sp. and streptococcus group d).  the essential oil of the ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi has shown to be  active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/ml to 56.86 mug/ml. however, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, gram-positive species showed greater  sensitivity to the action of eo, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the mooi river, north west province, south africa.
AB  == groundwater in the mooi river catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. in this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. bacterial isolates were identified by 16s rrna sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (hpc)  bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (arb)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (escherichia coli). antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. hpc bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units  (cfu)/ml. e. coli were enumerated from trimpark, school and cemetery. the blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. opportunistic pathogens isolated included pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, alcaligenes, flavobacterium, bacillus cereus and mycobacterium spp. varying patterns of antibiotic resistance  were observed. most hpc bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant arb. other arbs included alcaligenes  faecalis, ochrobactrum sp. and achromobacter sp. arbs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to hpcs.  the presence of e. coli and arb in these groundwater sources indicates potential  human health risks. these risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.

TI  == antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of calotropis gigantea l.
AB  == the present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (agnps) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of calotropis gigantea l. toward biomedical applications. initially, synthesis of agnps was confirmed through uv-vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (spr) at 420 nm. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. energy dispersive x-ray (edax) spectroscopy confirms the  presence of silver as a major constituent element. x-ray diffractograms displays  that the synthesized agnps were biphasic crystalline nature. electron microscopic studies such as field emission scanning electron microscopic (fe-sem) and transmission electron microscope (tem) reveals that synthesized agnps are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. further, crude latex  aqueous extract and synthesized agnps were evaluated against different bacterial  pathogens such as bacillus cereus, enterococci sp, shigella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized agnps exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized agnps against tested hela cells. the output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized agnps using latex of c. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.

TI  == biochemical properties and substrate recognition mechanism of gh31 alpha-glucosidase from bacillus sp. ahu 2001 with broad substrate specificity.
AB  == alpha-glucosidases are ubiquitous enzymes that hydrolyze the alpha-glucosidic linkage at the non-reducing end of substrates. in this study, we characterized an alpha-glucosidase (bspag31a) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 31 from bacillus sp. ahu 2001. recombinant bspag31a, produced in escherichia coli, had high hydrolytic activity toward maltooligosaccharides, kojibiose, nigerose, and neotrehalose. this is the first report of an alpha-glucosidase with high activity toward neotrehalose. the transglucosylation products, nigerose, kojibiose, isomaltose, and neotrehalose, were generated from 440 mm maltose. substitution of tyr268, situated on the beta --> alpha loop 1 of bspag31a, with trp increased hydrolytic activity toward isomaltose. this mutation reduced the hydrolytic activity toward maltooligosaccharides more than toward kojibiose, nigerose, and neotrehalose. analysis of the y173a mutant of bspag31a showed that tyr173, situated on the n-terminal domain loop, is associated with the formation of subsite +2. in y173a, the kcat/km for maltooligosaccharides slightly decreased with an increasing degree of polymerization compared with wild type. among the amino acid residues surrounding the substrate binding site, val543 and glu545 of  bspag31a were different from the corresponding residues of bacillus thermoamyloliquefaciens alpha-glucosidase ii, which has higher activity toward isomaltose than bspag31a. the e545g mutation slightly enhanced isomaltase activity without a large reduction of hydrolytic activities toward other substrates. v543a showed 1.8-3.5-fold higher hydrolytic activities toward all substrates other than neotrehalose compared with wild type, although its preference for isomaltose was unchanged.

TI  == synergistic action modes of arabinan degradation by exo- and endo-arabinosyl hydrolases.
AB  == two recombinant arabinosyl hydrolases, alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase from geobacillus sp. kctc 3012 (gafase) and endo-(1,5)-alpha-l-arabinanase from bacillus licheniformis dsm13 (blabnase), were overexpressed in escherichia coli,  and their synergistic modes of action against sugar beet (branched) arabinan were investigated. whereas gafase hydrolyzed 35.9% of l-arabinose residues from sugar  beet (branched) arabinan, endo-action of blabnase released only 0.5% of l-arabinose owing to its extremely low accessibility towards branched arabinan. interestingly, the simultaneous treatment of gafase and blabnase could liberate approximately 91.2% of l-arabinose from arabinan, which was significantly higher  than any single exo-enzyme treatment (35.9%) or even stepwise exo- after endo-enzyme treatment (75.5%). based on their unique modes of action, both exo- and endo-arabinosyl hydrolases can work in concert to catalyze the hydrolysis of  arabinan to l-arabinose. at the early stage in arabinan degradation, exo-acting gafase could remove the terminal arabinose branches to generate debranched arabinan, which could be successively hydrolyzed into arabinooligosaccharides via the endoaction of blabnase. at the final stage, the simultaneous actions of exo-  and endo-hydrolases could synergistically accelerate the l-arabinose production with high conversion yield.

AB  == to enrich the genetic resource of microbial xylanases with high activity and stability under alkaline conditions, a xylanase gene (xynsl4) was cloned from planococcus sp. sl4, an alkaline xylanase-producing strain isolated from the sediment of soda lake dabusu. deduced xynsl4 consists of a putative signal peptide of 29 residues and a catalytic domain (30-380 residues) of glycosyl hydrolase family 10, and shares the highest identity of 77% with a hypothetical protein from planomicrobium glaciei chr43. phylogenetic analysis indicated that deduced xynsl4 is closely related with thermophilic and alkaline xylanases from geobacillus and bacillus species. the gene xynsl4 was expressed heterologously in escherichia coli and the recombinant enzyme showed some superior properties. purified recombinant xynsl4 (rxynsl4) was highly active and stable over the neutral and alkaline ph range from 6 to 11, with maximum activity at ph 7 and more than 60% activity at ph 11. it had an apparent temperature optimum of 70 degrees c and retained stable at this temperature in the presence of substrate. rxynsl4 was highly halotolerant, retaining more than 55% activity with 0.25-3.0 m nacl and was stable at the concentration of nacl up to 4m. the enzyme activity was significantly enhanced by beta-mercaptoethanol and ca(2+) but strongly inhibited by heavy-metal ions and sds. this thermophilic and alkaline- and salt-tolerant enzyme has great potential for basic research and industrial applications.

TI  == photochromic conversion in a red/green cyanobacteriochrome from synechocystis pcc6803: quantum yields in solution and photoswitching dynamics in living e. coli cells.
AB  == the protein encoded by the gene slr1393 from the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc6803 (slr1393) is composed of three gaf domains, a pas domain, and a histidine kinase motif. the third gaf domain (referred to as gaf3) was previously characterized as the sole domain in this protein, being able to carry phycocyanobilin (pcb) as the chromophore and to accomplish photochemistry. gaf3 shows photochromicity, and is able to switch between a red-absorbing parental state (gaf3r, lambdamax = 649 nm) and a green-absorbing photoproduct state (gaf3g, lambdamax = 536 nm) upon appropriate irradiation. in this study we have determined the photochemical quantum yields for the interconversion between both  forms using two methods: an "absolute" method and a reference-based control. the  latter is a comparative procedure which exploits a well-characterized blue-light  photoreceptor, ytva from bacillus subtilis, and the cyanobacterial phytochrome cph1 as actinometers. the former is an ad hoc developed, four laser-based setup where two cw lasers provide the pump beams to induce photoswitching (red to green and green to red, respectively) and two cw lasers simultaneously monitor the appearance and disappearance of the two species. interestingly, fit analysis of the recorded transient absorbance changes provided a quantum yield for the green  --> red conversion ( approximately 0.3) at least three times larger than for the  red --> green conversion ( approximately 0.08). these data are in agreement with  the results from the comparative method documenting the usefulness of the 'direct' method developed here for quantum yields' determination. the light-induced switching capability of this photochromic protein allowed measuring the kinetics of gaf3 immobilized on a glass plate, and within living, overexpressing escherichia coli cells.

(2s)-butylitaconic acid (5) and (2s)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. compound 2 was  highly active against the clinically relevant s. aureus. by comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at c-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. our study reveals plausible ecological roles of  the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.

TI  == biosynthetic pathway for the cyanide-free production of phenylacetonitrile in escherichia coli by utilizing plant cytochrome p450 79a2 and bacterial aldoxime dehydratase.
AB  == the biosynthetic pathway for the production of phenylacetonitrile (pan), which has a wide variety of uses in chemical and pharmaceutical industries, was constructed in escherichia coli utilizing enzymes from the plant glucosinolate-biosynthetic and bacterial aldoxime-nitrile pathways. first, the single-step reaction to produce e,z-phenylacetaldoxime (paox) from l-phe was constructed in e. coli by introducing the genes encoding cytochrome p450 (cyp) 79a2 and cyp reductase from arabidopsis thaliana, yielding the e,z-paox-producing transformant. second, this step was expanded to the production of pan by further  introducing the aldoxime dehydratase (oxd) gene from bacillus sp. strain oxb-1, yielding the pan-producing transformant. the e,z-paox-producing transformant also produced phenethyl alcohol and pan as by-products, which were suggested to be the metabolites of e,z-paox produced by e. coli enzymes, while the pan-producing transformant accumulated only pan in the culture broth, which suggested that the  cyp79a2 reaction (the conversion of l-phe to e,z-paox) was a potential bottleneck in the pan production pathway. expression of active cyp79a2 and concentration of  biomass were improved by the combination of the autoinduction method, coexpression of groe, encoding the heat shock protein groel/groes, n-terminal truncation of cyp79a2, and optimization of the culture conditions, yielding a >60-fold concentration of e,z-paox (up to 2.9 mm). the concentration of pan was 4.9 mm under the optimized conditions. these achievements show the potential of this bioprocess to produce nitriles and nitrile derivatives in the absence of toxic chemicals.

AB  == d-psicose has been attracting attention in recent years because of its alimentary activities and is used as an ingredient in a range of foods and dietary supplements. to develop a one-step enzymatic process of d-psicose production, thermoactive d-glucose isomerase and the d-psicose 3-epimerase obtained from bacillus sp. and ruminococcus sp., respectively, were successfully co-expressed in escherichia coli bl21 strain. the substrate of one-step enzymatic process was  d-glucose. the co-expression system exhibited maximum activity at 65 degrees c and ph 7.0. mg(2+) could enhance the output of d-psicose by 2.32 fold to 1.6 g/l  from 10 g/l of d-glucose. when using high-fructose corn syrup (hfcs) as substrate, 135 g/l d-psicose was produced under optimum conditions. the mass ratio of d-glucose, d-fructose, and d-psicose was almost 3.0:2.7:1.0, when the reaction reached equilibrium after an 8h incubation time. this co-expression system approaching to produce d-psicose has potential application in food and beverage products, especially softdrinks.

TI  == enhanced production of 2,3-butanediol by a genetically engineered bacillus sp. brc1 using a hydrolysate of empty palm fruit bunches.
AB  == a bacillus species that produces 2,3-butanediol (2,3-bd), termed brc1, was newly  isolated, and a 2,3-bd dehydrogenase (bdh) from this species was identified and characterized at the molecular and biochemical level. sequence analysis revealed  that bdh is homologous to d-2,3-bd dehydrogenases. an analysis of the enzymatic properties of bdh overexpressed in escherichia coli confirmed the molecular results, showing preferred activity toward d-2,3-bd. optimum ph, temperature, and kinetics determined for reductive and oxidative reactions support the preferential production of 2,3-bd during cell growth. overexpression of bdh under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter resulted in increased enzyme activity  and enhanced 2,3-bd production in bacillus sp. brc1. additionally, a hydrolysate  of cellulosic material, (empty palm fruit bunches), was successfully used for the enhanced production of 2,3-bd in the recombinant bacillus strain.

TI  == the blow fly, chrysomya megacephala, and the house fly, musca domestica, as mechanical vectors of pathogenic bacteria in northeast thailand.
AB  == the oriental latrine fly, chrysomya megacephala (fabricius) (diptera: calliphoridae) and the house fly, musca domestica l., (diptera: muscidae) are synanthropic flies which are adapted to live in close association with human habitations, thereby making them likely mechanical vectors of several pathogens to humans. there were two main aims of this study. the first aim was to determine the prevalence of these two fly species from five types of human habitations including: fresh-food markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and  paddy fields, in the muang ubon ratchathani and warinchamrap districts of ubon ratchathani province of northeast thailand. flies collection were conducted monthly from september 2010-october 2011 using a reconstructable funnel trap, containing 1 day-tainted beef offal as bait. a total of 7 750 flies (6 401 c. megacephala and 1 349 m.domestica) were collected. the second aim was to examine  the potential of these flies to carry pathogenic bacteria. bacteria were isolated from 994 individual flies collected using a sweep net (555 c. megacephala and 439 m. domestica). a total of 15 bacterial genera were isolated from the external surfaces, comprising ten genera of gram-negative bacteria and five gram-positive  bacteria. the most common bacteria isolated from both species were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by streptococcus group d non-enterococci. human pathogenic enteric bacteria isolated were salmonella sp.,  shigella sp., escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhi, bacillus sp., and enterococcus sp., of which s. typhi is the first report of isolation from these fly species. other human pathogens included staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. not only were the number of c. megacephala positive for bacteria significantly higher than for m. domestica, but they were also carrying ~11-12 times greater bacterial load than m. domestica. these data suggest that both fly  species should be considered potential mechanical vectors of bacterial pathogens  associated with human habitations year-round in this region of northeast thailand.

TI  == inducible factors with antimicrobial activity after immune challenge in the haemolymph of red palm weevil (insecta).
AB  == insects are capable of innate immune responses elicited after microbial infection. in this process, the receptor-mediated recognition of foreign bodies and the subsequent activation of immunocompetent cells lead to the synthesis ex novo of a peptide pool with antimicrobial activity. we investigated the inducible immune response of a coleopteran, rhynchophorus ferrugineus, challenged with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. after immunization, we evaluated the presence of antimicrobial peptides using either biochemical analyses or microbiological techniques. the antimicrobial properties of the newly synthesized protein pool, detectable in haemolymph fractions of low molecular mass, showed strong antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. ox1, bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus). in addition to the preliminary study of the mechanism of action of the pool of antimicrobial  peptides, we also investigated its effects on bacterial cell walls by means of fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. the data suggest that the main effects seem to be directed at destabilizing and damaging the bacterial  wall. this study provides data that help us to understand some aspects of the inducible innate immunity in a system model that lacks anticipatory responses. however, the weevil has finely tuned its defensive strategies to counteract effectively microbial infection.

TI  == composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some acinos miller species.
AB  == gc and gc/ms analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six acinos miller species from serbia and montenegro were performed. seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. the common feature of the a. suaveolens, a. majoranifolius and a. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the a. graveolens, a. arvensis and a. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. the total flavonoids, polyphenols  and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (frap and dpph assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. the highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of a. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. a disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: bacillus subtilis, clostridium pyogenes, enterococcus sp., micrococcus flavus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli; fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae). the preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of a. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == in-vitro assessment of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts and essential oil of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis.
AB  == background: owing to the complexity of the antioxidant materials and their mechanism of actions, it is obvious that no single testing method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile. the essential oil of the thymus specie may still possess other important activities in traditional  medicine, it can be used in the treatment of fever and cough. this essential oil  may also have an anticancer activity. methods: the essential oils aerial parts hydrodistilled from thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were characterised by gc/ms analysis and the methanolic extracts were chemically characterized by hplc method. the essence of thyme was evaluated for its antioxidant and antibacterial  activity. result: the terpinen-4-ol are the principal class of metabolites (33.34%) among which 1.8-cineole (19.96%) and camphor (19.20%) predominate. in this study, quantitative values of antioxidant activity of crude methanolic extracts of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis were investigated. the essential oils was screened for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogenic microorganisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteridis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes) by well diffusion method and agar dilution method (mic). all the essences were found to inhibit the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria organisms tested. these activities were correlated with the presence of phenolic compounds in active fractions. hplc confirmed presence of phenolic compounds in methanol extracts. conclusion: methanol extracts and essential oils from aerial parts of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were examined for their potential as antioxidants. the technique for measuring antioxidant activity, which was developed using dpph, abts and beta-carotene bleaching, produced results as found in established literatures. the present results indicate clearly that methanol extracts and essential oils from thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis possess antioxidant properties  and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants, also their essential oil have an antibacterial effect.

TI  == ftir spectroscopy offers hints towards widespread molecular changes in cobalt-acclimated freshwater bacteria.
AB  == high concentrations of heavy metals can be toxic for bacteria. however, after prolonged exposure, bacteria can become acclimated and begin to be able to grow in the presence of heavy metals. acclimation can involve alterations of metabolism and molecular structures. our aim was to examine these alterations in  cobalt-acclimated bacteria via attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared (atr-ftir) spectroscopy on viable samples. bacillus sp. and pseudomonas  sp. isolated from a temperate shallow lake and a well-established strain of e. coli were investigated. our results revealed consistent, wide-spread changes in cell membrane and cell wall dynamics of bacillus sp. and e. coli, including a decrease in peptidoglycan content of bacillus sp. and increased lipid ordering of the membrane in both bacteria. furthermore, a decrease in rna and protein concentrations of bacillus sp. was measured. all three bacteria studied showed a  decrease in conformational freedom of proteins following cobalt acclimation. interestingly, both bacillus sp. and e. coli showed slight but significant alterations in their dna conformations which might imply a methylation-mediated memory formation leading to epigenetic modulation for cobalt adaptation.

TI  == comparative analysis of pathogenic organisms in cockroaches from different community settings in edo state, nigeria.
AB  == cockroaches are abundant in nigeria and are seen to harbour an array of pathogens. environmental and sanitary conditions associated with demographic/socio-economic settings of an area could contribute to the prevalence of disease pathogens in cockroaches. a total of 246 cockroaches (periplaneta americana) in urban (benin, n=91), semi-urban (ekpoma, n=75) and rural (emuhi, n=70) settings in edo state, nigeria were collected within and around households. the external body surfaces and alimentary canal of these cockroaches were screened for bacterial, fungal, and parasitological infections. bacillus sp. and  escherichia coli were the most common bacteria in cockroaches. however, enterococcus faecalis could not be isolated in cockroaches trapped from ekpoma and emuhi. aspergillus niger was the most prevalent fungus in benin and ekpoma, while mucor sp. was predominant in emuhi. parasitological investigations revealed the preponderance of ascaris lumbricoides in benin and emuhi, while trichuris trichura was the most predominant in ekpoma. the prevalence and burden of infection in cockroaches is likely to be a reflection of the sanitary conditions  of these areas. also, cockroaches in these areas making incursions in homes may increase the risk of human infections with these disease agents.

TI  == x-ray structure of a novel l-ribose isomerase acting on a non-natural sugar l-ribose as its ideal substrate.
AB  == l-ribose, a pentose, is not known to exist in nature. although organisms typically do not have a metabolic pathway that uses l-ribose as a carbon source,  prokaryotes use various sugars as carbon sources for survival. acinetobacter sp.  dl-28 has been shown to express the novel enzyme, l-ribose isomerase (acl-rbi), which catalyzes reversible isomerization between l-ribose and l-ribulose. acl-rbi showed the highest activity to l-ribose, followed by d-lyxose with 47% activity,  and had no significant amino acid sequence similarity to structure-known proteins, except for weak homology with the d-lyxose isomerases from escherichia  coli o157 : h7 (18%) and bacillus subtilis strain (19%). thus, acl-rbi is expected to have the unique three-dimensional structure to recognize l-ribose as  its ideal substrate. the x-ray structures of acl-rbi in complexes with substrates were determined. acl-rbi had a cupin-type beta-barrel structure, and the catalytic site was found between two large beta-sheets with a bound metal ion. the catalytic site structures clearly showed that acl-rbi adopted a cis-enediol intermediate mechanism for the isomerization reaction using two glutamate residues (glu113 and glu204) as acid/base catalysts. in its crystal form, acl-rbi formed a unique homotetramer with many substrate sub-binding sites, which likely  facilitated capture of the substrate. database: the atomic coordinates and structure factors of acl-rbi/l-ribose, acl-rbi/l-ribulose, acl-rbi/ribitol, e204q/l-ribose and e204q/l-ribulose have been deposited in the protein data bank  under accession codes, 4q0p, 4q0q, 4q0s, 4q0u and 4q0v.

TI  == undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase inhibitors: antibacterial drug leads.
AB  == there is a significant need for new antibiotics due to the rise in drug resistance. drugs such as methicillin and vancomycin target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, but methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have now arisen and are of major concern.  inhibitors acting on new targets in cell wall biosynthesis are thus of particular interest since they might also restore sensitivity to existing drugs, and the cis-prenyl transferase undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (upps), essential for lipid i, lipid ii, and thus, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is one such target. we used 12 upps crystal structures to validate virtual screening models and then assayed 100 virtual hits (from 450,000 compounds) against upps from s. aureus and escherichia coli. the most promising inhibitors (ic50 approximately 2 mum, ki approximately 300 nm) had activity against mrsa, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus anthracis, and a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus sp. with mic or ic50 values in the 0.25-4 mug/ml range. moreover, one compound (1), a rhodanine with close structural similarity to the commercial diabetes drug epalrestat, exhibited good  activity as well as a fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) of 0.1 with methicillin against the community-acquired mrsa usa300 strain, indicating strong synergism.

TI  == a cas lyase for degradation of environmental organoarsenical herbicides and animal husbandry growth promoters.
AB  == arsenic is the most widespread environmental toxin. substantial amounts of pentavalent organoarsenicals have been used as herbicides, such as monosodium methylarsonic acid (msma), and as growth enhancers for animal husbandry, such as  roxarsone (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylarsonic acid) [rox(v)]. these undergo environmental degradation to more toxic inorganic arsenite [as(iii)]. we previously demonstrated a two-step pathway of degradation of msma to as(iii) by microbial communities involving sequential reduction to methylarsonous acid [mas(iii)] by one bacterial species and demethylation from mas(iii) to as(iii) by another. in this study, the gene responsible for mas(iii) demethylation was identified from an environmental mas(iii)-demethylating isolate, bacillus sp. md1. this gene, termed arsenic inducible gene (arsi), is in an arsenic resistance (ars) operon and encodes a nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase with c as lyase activity. heterologous expression of arsi conferred mas(iii)-demethylating activity and mas(iii) resistance to an arsenic-hypersensitive strain of escherichia coli, demonstrating that mas(iii) demethylation is a detoxification process. purified arsi catalyzes fe(2+)-dependent mas(iii) demethylation. in addition, arsi cleaves the c as bond in trivalent roxarsone and other aromatic arsenicals. arsi homologs are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and we propose that arsi-catalyzed organoarsenical degradation has a significant impact on the arsenic biogeocycle. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular mechanism for organoarsenic degradation by a c as lyase.

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  == surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. the aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. the identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. the antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (tpc), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac). antimicrobial activities were evaluated against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans. a total of 39 bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as vibrio sp.  (48.72%), alteromonas sp. (12.82%), shewanella sp. (12.26%), serratia sp. (2.56%), citricoccus sp. (2.56%), cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), ruegeria sp. (2.56%)  and staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% basic local alignment search tool (blast) match, and some of those could be new. the highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against b. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (shewanella sp.). several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against s. aureus, mainly belonging to alteromonas sp. and vibrio sp. there were no positive results against fungi and gram-negative bacteria. bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == modification of fatty acids in membranes of bacteria: implication for an adaptive mechanism to the toxicity of carbon nanotubes.
AB  == we explored whether bacteria could respond adaptively to the presence of carbon nanotubes (cnts) by investigating the influence of cnts on the viability, composition of fatty acids, and cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria in aqueous medium for 24 h exposure. the cnts included long single-walled carbon nanotubes (l-swcnts), short single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-swcnts), short carboxyl single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-swcnt-cooh), and aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (a-mwcnts). the bacteria included three common model bacteria, staphyloccocus aureus (gram-positive), bacillus subtilis (gram-positive), and escherichia coli (gram-negative), and one polybrominated diphenyl ether degrading strain, ochrobactrum sp. (gram-negative). generally, l-swcnts were the most toxic to bacteria, whereas s-swcnt-cooh showed the mildest bacterial toxicity. ochrobactrum sp. was more susceptible to the toxic effect of cnts than e. coli. compared to the control in the absence of cnts, the viability of ochrobactrum sp. decreased from 71.6-81.4% to 41.8-70.2%, and e. coli from 93.7-104.0% to 67.7-91.0% when cnt concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg l(-1). the cytoplasmic membrane fluidity of bacteria increased with cnt concentration, and a significant negative correlation existed between the bacterial viabilities and membrane fluidity for e. coli and ochrobactrum sp. (p < 0.05), indicating that the increase in membrane fluidity induced by cnts was an important factor causing the inactivation of bacteria. in the presence of cnts, e. coli and ochrobactrum sp. showed elevation in the level of saturated fatty acids accompanied with reduction in unsaturated fatty acids, compensating for the fluidizing effect of cnts. this demonstrated that bacteria could modify their composition of fatty acids to adapt to the toxicity of cnts. in contrast, s. aureus and b. subtilis exposed to cnts increased the proportion of branched-chain fatty acids and decreased the level of straight-chain fatty acids, which was also favorable to counteract the toxic effect of cnts. this study suggests that the bacterial tolerances to cnts are associated with both the adaptive modification of fatty acids in the membrane and the physicochemical properties of cnts. this is the first report about the physiologically adaptive response of bacteria to cnts, and may help to further understand the ecotoxicological effects of cnts.

TI  == structural properties of prokaryotic promoter regions correlate with functional features.
AB  == the structural properties of the dna molecule are known to play a critical role in transcription. in this paper, the structural profiles of promoter regions were studied within the context of their diversity and their function for eleven prokaryotic species; escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas auroginosa, geobacter sulfurreducens helicobacter pylori, chlamydophila pneumoniae, synechocystis sp., synechoccocus elongates, bacillus anthracis, and the archaea sulfolobus solfataricus. the main anchor point for these promoter regions were transcription start sites identified through high-throughput experiments or collected within large curated databases.  prokaryotic promoter regions were found to be less stable and less flexible than  the genomic mean across all studied species. however, direct comparison between species revealed differences in their structural profiles that can not solely be  explained by the difference in genomic gc content. in addition, comparison with functional data revealed that there are patterns in the promoter structural profiles that can be linked to specific functional loci, such as sigma factor regulation or transcription factor binding. interestingly, a novel structural element clearly visible near the transcription start site was found in genes associated with essential cellular functions and growth in several species. our analyses reveals the great diversity in promoter structural profiles both between and within prokaryotic species. we observed relationships between structural diversity and functional features that are interesting prospects for further research to yet uncharacterized functional loci defined by dna structural properties.

AB  == the coastal aquaculture mainly shrimps constitute major export sector in bangladesh and is increasingly shaped by international trade conditions and by national responses to those stringent quality and safety standards. pcr based validated methods for detection of major bacterial pathogens in shrimp might be very useful tool for ensuring quality and safety standards of exportable shrimps. the objective of this study was to evaluate overall performance (sensitivity and  specificity) of the multiplex pcr assay for detection of vibrio cholerae, vibrio  parahaemolyticus, salmonella sp. and escherichia coli o157:h7 from spiked shrimp  samples. the targeted genes were ompw for v. cholerae, tdh for v. parahaemolyticus, sefa for salmonella spp. and hlyehec for e. coli o157:h7. the genomic dna was extracted by using standard method and amplified accordingly. sensitivity of the assay was tested by inoculating the shrimp homogenate with viable cells of laboratory references strains (target pathogens). the genes were  amplified individually both from culture homogenate and spiked samples. twenty different uniplex and multiplex pcr assay were performed; the results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex pcr are comparable to that of the results of uniplex pcr for the samples. dna extracted from shrimp samples spiked  with non-target pathogen (bacillus cereus, shigella flexneri and staphylococcus aureus) yielded negative results.

TI  == structure-activity relationships of 3,3'-phenylmethylene-bis-4-hydroxycoumarins:  selective and potent inhibitors of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == dicoumarols and coumarin derivatives have shown a variety of pharmaceutical activities and have been found to be potent inhibitor for the nad(p)h-dependent flavoproteins. in this report, dicoumarol and its derivatives containing the substituted benzene ring at the methylenebis position were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria: staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the results showed that the synthesized dicoumarols affect cell growth but are selective against gram-positive over gram-negative bacterial cells. however, for most derivatives, the substitution of steric bulky benzene group on the methylenebis position appears to decrease in the efficacy of antibacterial effect. this finding is roughly described by the predicted poorer docked structure of the derivatives to a homology model of s. aureus flavoprotein. 3d-qsar study highlighted structural features around the substituted benzene ring of dicoumarols as the antibacterial activity. comfa and  comsia contour maps support the idea that steric repulsion at the para position could diminish the antibacterial activity. the results of this study provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for the antibacterial activity of dicoumarols.

TI  == efficicent (r)-phenylethanol production with enantioselectivity-alerted (s)-carbonyl reductase ii and nadph regeneration.
AB  == the nadph-dependent (s)-carbonyl reductaseii from candida parapsilosis catalyzes  acetophenone to chiral phenylethanol in a very low yield of 3.2%. site-directed mutagenesis was used to design two mutants ala220asp and glu228ser, inside or adjacent to the substrate-binding pocket. both mutations caused a significant enantioselectivity shift toward (r)-phenylethanol in the reduction of acetophenone. the variant e228s produced (r)-phenylethanol with an optical purity above 99%, in 80.2% yield. the e228s mutation resulted in a 4.6-fold decrease in  the k m value, but nearly 5-fold and 21-fold increases in the k cat and k cat/k m values with respect to the wild type. for nadph regeneration, bacillus sp. yx-1 glucose dehydrogenase was introduced into the (r)-phenylethanol pathway. a coexpression system containing e228s and glucose dehydrogenase was constructed. the system was optimized by altering the coding gene order on the plasmid and using the shine-dalgarno sequence and the aligned spacing sequence as a linker between them. the presence of glucose dehydrogenase increased the nadph concentration slightly and decreased nadp(+) pool 2- to 4-fold; the nadph/nadp(+) ratio was improved 2- to 5-fold. the recombinant escherichia coli/pet-ms-sd-as-g, with e228s located upstream and glucose dehydrogenase downstream, showed excellent performance, giving (r)-phenylethanol of an optical purity of 99.5 % in 92.2% yield in 12 h in the absence of an external cofactor. when 0.06 mm nadp(+)  was added at the beginning of the reaction, the reaction duration was reduced to  1 h. optimization of the coexpression system stimulated an over 30-fold increase  in the yield of (r)-phenylethanol, and simultaneously reduced the reaction time 48-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme. this report describes possible mechanisms for alteration of the enantiopreferences of carbonyl reductases by site mutation, and cofactor rebalancing pathways for efficient chiral alcohols production.

TI  == a one-pot system for production of l-2-aminobutyric acid from l-threonine by l-threonine deaminase and a nadh-regeneration system based on l-leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase.
AB  == l-2-aminobutyric acid (l-aba) is an unnatural amino acid that is a key intermediate for the synthesis of several important drugs. it can be produced by  transaminase or dehydrogenase from alpha-ketobutyric acid, which can be synthesized enzymatically from the bulk amino acid, l-threonine. deamination of l-threonine followed by a hydrogenation reaction gave almost the theoretical yield and was estimated to be more cost-effective than the established chemical process. l-threonine deaminase from escherichia coli, l-leucine dehydrogenase from bacillus cereus, and formate dehydrogenase from pseudomonas sp. were over-expressed in e. coli and used for one-pot production of l-aba with formate as a co-substrate for nadh regeneration. 30 mol l-threonine were converted to 29.2 mol l-aba at 97.3 % of theoretical yield and with productivity of 6.37 g l(-1) h(-1) at 50 l. this process offers a promising approach to fulfil industrial requirements for l-aba.

AB  == background: beta-1,3-glucanases catalyze the hydrolysis of glucan polymers containing beta-1,3-linkages. these enzymes are of great biotechnological, agricultural and industrial interest. the applications of beta-1,3-glucanases is  well established in fungal disease biocontrol, yeast extract production and wine  extract clarification. thus, the identification and characterization of novel beta-1,3-glucanases with high catalytic efficiency and stability is of particular interest. results: a beta-1,3-glucanase gene designated pgla was cloned from a newly isolated strain paenibacillus sp. s09. the gene pgla contained a 2631-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 876 amino acids which shows 76% identity with the beta-1,3-glucanase (bglh) from bacillus circulans iam1165. the  encoded protein pgla is composed of a signal peptide, an n-terminal leader region, a glycoside hydrolase family 16 (gh16) catalytic domain and a c-terminal  immunoglobulin like (ig-like) domain. the escherichia coli expression system of pgla and five truncated derivatives containing one or two modules was constructed to investigate the role of catalytic and non-catalytic modules. the ph for optimal activity of the enzymes was slightly affected (ph 5.5-6.5) by the presence of different modules. however, the temperature for optimal activity was  strongly influenced by the c-terminal domain and ranged from 50 to 60 degrees c.  deletion of c-terminal domain resulted in obviously enhancing enzymatic thermostability. specific activity assay indicated that pgla specifically hydrolyzes beta-1,3-glucan. insoluble beta-1,3-glucan binding and hydrolysis were boosted by the presence of n-and c-terminal domains. kinetic analysis showed that the presence of n-and c-terminus enhances the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of the catalytic domain toward laminarin. carbohydrate-binding assay directly confirmed the binding capabilities of the n-and c-terminal domains. conclusions: this study provides new insight into the impacts of non-catalytic modules on enzymatic properties of beta-1,3-glucanase. activity comparison of full-length pgla and truncated forms revealed the negative effect of c-terminal region on thermal stability of the enzyme. both the n-and c-terminal domains exerted strong binding activity toward insoluble beta-1,3-glucan, and could be classified into cbm families.

TI  == paraben resistance in bacteria from sewage treatment plant effluents in india.
AB  == parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. generally, sewage treatment plants (stps) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. in this study, bacteria in stp effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. the susceptibility was in the order of staphylococcus aureus > bacillus sp. >escherichia coli > pseudomonas aeruginosa. gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control  and gram-positive bacteria. further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >/=5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. the increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. this is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of indian stps. paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.

TI  == function of arsatorf7orf8 of bacillus sp. cdb3 in arsenic resistance.
AB  == bacillus sp. cdb3 isolated from an arsenic contaminated cattle dip site possesses an uncommon arsenic resistance (ars) operon bearing eight genes in the order of arsrycdatorf7orf8. we investigated the functions of arsa, arst, orf7 and orf8 in  arsenic resistance using a plasmid-based gene knockout approach in the ars gene deficient escherichia coli strain aw3110. the cdb3 arsa gene was shown to play a  significant role in resistance, suggesting that the encoded arsa may couple with  the arsenite transporter, forming an arsay complex that can enhance arsenite extrusion efficiency. the disruption of either arstor orf7 was not observed to affect arsenic resistance in the heterologous e. coli host, but their involvement in arsenic resistance can not be excluded. the orf8 gene is predicted to encode a putative dual-specificity protein phosphatase which also shares certain homology  to arsenate reductases. the function loss of orf8 resulted in a remarkable decrease in resistance to arsenate, though not arsenite. to examine if this effect was due to the reduction of arsenate by orf8, the arsc gene within the 8-gene operon was disrupted. the resulting abolishment of arsenate resistance suggests that the involvement of orf8 in arsenic resistance is not via reductase  activity.

TI  == d-xylose detection in escherichia coli by a xylose binding protein-dependent response.
AB  == a gene circuit for the controlled expression of a marker gene and for the assay of xylose concentration in escherichia coli has been designed and tested. the xylf coding sequence for the xylose binding protein (xbp) was cloned in pt7t318u  downstream from the promoter for xylanase a from b. subtilis (pbsu), together with the gfp coding sequence (gfp) under the control of the xylf promoter, forming the pt7t3-gfp-xbp construct. gfp fluorescence in escherichia coli jw3538-1 xylf-transformed with pt7t3-gfp-xbp was approximately 1.4 x higher after 520 min growth in the presence of 5mm xylose than in cells transformed with pt7t3-gfp. under saturating xylose concentration, flow cytometry analysis showed  that all cells resulted in homogeneous populations, and the population with xbp showed a fluorescence greater than that without xbp. activity of the xylf promoter in cells transformed with pt7t3-gfp-xbp was approximately 40% higher than with the pt7t3-gfp. no response was observed with arabinose and ribose, showing that the expression effects were specific for xylose, demonstrating the potential use of the gene circuit as a biosensor.

TI  == nonomuraea sp. id06-a0189 inulin fructotransferase (dfa iii-forming): gene cloning, characterization and conservation among other nonomuraea species.
AB  == the inulin fructotransferase (dfa iii-forming)(ec 4.2.2.18) gene in nonomuraea sp. id06-a0189 was amplified from genomic dna, sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli. the 1326-bp gene, designated as nsp-ift, encodes a protein composed of a putative 37-amino-acid signal peptide and 404-amino-acid mature protein. a putative ribosomal binding sequence was identified 12 bases upstream from the start codon. however, a typical bacterial promoter could not be found by in silico analysis. the deduced amino-acid sequence of the enzyme was most similar to that of inulin fructotransferase (dfa i-forming) in frankia sp. ean1pec. phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino-acid sequences indicated that nonomuraea sp. id06-a0189 and frankia sp. ean1pec inulin fructotransferases formed a distinct clade from those from arthrobacter sp. h65-7, a. globiformis and bacillus sp. snu-7 that showed 57, 56 and 56% identity to that of nsp-ift, respectively. the nsp-ift without a putative signal peptide was successfully expressed in e. coli and partially purified using his-tag affinity chromatography. the recombinant enzyme displayed optimum temperature between 65 and 70 degrees c, optimum ph between 5.5 and 6.0 and remained stable up to 70 degrees c. the properties were identical to those of the original enzyme. of 10 nonomuraea species tested by southern hybridization, enzyme activity measurements and pcr, only nonomuraea sp. id06-a0189 has the nsp-ift gene, suggesting that nsp-ift is not highly conserved in this genus.

TI  == [expression optimization and characterization of tenebrio molitor antimicrobiol peptides tmamp1m in escherichia coli].
AB  == to improve the expression level of tmamp1m gene from tenebrio molitor in escherichia coli, we studied the effects of expression level and activity of the  fusion protein his-tmamp1m by conditions, such as culture temperature, inducing time and the final concentration of inductor isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg). we analyzed the optimum expression conditions by tricine-sds-page electrophoresis, meanwhile, detected its antibacterial activity by using agarose cavity diffusion method. the results suggest that when inducing the recombinant plasmid with a final iptg concentration of 0.1 mmol/l at 37 degrees c for 4 h, there was the highest expression level of fusion protein his-tmamp1m in escherichia coli. under these conditions, the expression of fusion protein accounted for 40% of the total cell  lysate with the best antibacterial activity. we purified the fusion protein his-tmamplm with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni-nta) metal-affinity chromatography matrices. western blotting analysis indicates that the his monoclonal antibody could be specifically bound to fusion protein his-tmamplm. after expression by inducing, the fusion protein could inhibit the growth of host cell transformed by pet30a-tmamp1m. the fusion protein his-tmamp1m had better stability and remained higher antibacterial activities when incubated at 100 degrees c for 10 h, repeated freeze thawing at -20 degrees c, dissolved in strong acid and alkali, or treated by organic solvents and protease. moreover, the minimum inhibitory concentration results demonstrated that the fusion protein his-tmamp1m has a good antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus sp., corynebacterium glutamicum, bacillus thuringiensis, corynebacterium sp. this study laid the foundation to promote the application of  insect antimicrobial peptides and further research.

TI  == a thermophilic alkalophilic alpha-amylase from bacillus sp. aah-31 shows a novel  domain organization among glycoside hydrolase family 13 enzymes.
AB  == alpha-amylases (ec 3.2.1.1) hydrolyze internal alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkages of starch and related glucans. bacillus sp. aah-31 produces an alkalophilic thermophilic alpha-amylase (amyl) of higher molecular mass, 91 kda, than typical  bacterial alpha-amylases. in this study, the amyl gene was cloned to determine its primary structure, and the recombinant enzyme, produced in escherichia coli,  was characterized. amyl shows no hydrolytic activity towards pullulan, but the central region of amyl (gly395-asp684) was similar to neopullulanase-like alpha-amylases. in contrast to known neopullulanase-like alpha-amylases, the n-terminal region (gln29-phe102) of amyl was similar to carbohydrate-binding module family 20 (cbm20), which is involved in the binding of enzymes to starch granules. recombinant amyl showed more than 95% of its maximum activity in a ph range of 8.2-10.5, and was stable below 65 degrees c and from ph 6.4 to 11.9. the kcat values for soluble starch, gamma-cyclodextrin, and maltotriose were 103 s(-1), 67.6 s(-1), and 5.33 s(-1), respectively, and the km values were 0.100 mg/ml, 0.348 mm, and 2.06 mm, respectively. recombinant amyl did not bind to starch granules. but the substitution of trp45 and trp84, conserved in site 1 of  cbm20, with ala reduced affinity to soluble starch, while the mutations did not affect affinity for oligosaccharides. substitution of trp61, conserved in site 2  of cbm20, with ala enhanced hydrolytic activity towards soluble starch, indicating that site 2 of amyl does not contribute to binding to soluble long-chain substrates.

AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == bioanalysis for biocatalysis: multiplexed capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry assay for aminotransferase substrate discovery and specificity profiling.
AB  == in this work, we introduce an entirely automated enzyme assay based on capillary  electrophoresis coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry termed minisep-ms for multiple interfluent nanoinjections-incubation-separation-enzyme profiling using mass spectrometry. minisep-ms requires only nanoliters of reagent solutions and uses the separation capillary as a microreactor, allowing multiple  substrates to be assayed simultaneously. the method can be used to rapidly profile the substrate specificity of any enzyme and to measure steady-state kinetics in an automated fashion. we used the minisep-ms assay to profile the substrate specificity of three aminotransferases (e. coli aspartate aminotransferase, e. coli branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, and bacillus sp. ym-1 d-amino acid aminotransferase) for 33 potential amino acid substrates and to measure steady-state kinetics. using minisep-ms, we were able to recapitulate the known substrate specificities and to discover new amino acid  substrates for these industrially relevant enzymes. additionally, we were able to measure the apparent k(m) and k(cat) parameters for amino acid donor substrates of these aminotransferases. because of its many advantages, the minisep-ms assay  has the potential of becoming a useful tool for researchers aiming to identify or create novel enzymes for specific biocatalytic applications.

TI  == resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a wwtp.
AB  == the microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. this fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli (three strains), enterobacter cloacae, kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), kluyvera intermedia, citrobacter freundii (two strains), bacillus sp. and enterobacter sp. the first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.l(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees c). the results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.l(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees c for 30 min. the other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.l(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). the results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.

TI  == a high-throughput assay for screening l- or d-amino acid specific aminotransferase mutant libraries.
AB  == aminotransferases are pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes whose potential for the biocatalytic production of enantiopure amino acids is increasingly recognized. because of this, there is a growing interest in engineering them to alter their substrate specificity and to increase their catalytic activity. here, we report the development of a high-throughput assay for screening alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent aminotransferase mutant libraries. to achieve this, we exploited the l-glutamate dehydrogenase coupled assay that has previously been shown to allow for aminotransferase activity to be monitored in vitro. we adapted this assay to allow screening of mutant libraries of either l- or d-amino acid specific aminotransferases in a continuous fashion. this assay requiring clarified cell lysates is reproducible, rapid, and sensitive because it allowed for the identification of a catalytically active mutant of bacillus sp. ym-1 d-amino acid aminotransferase displaying a decrease in k(cat)/k(m) of more than two orders of magnitude. in addition, this assay allowed us to discover a mutant  of escherichia coli branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, f36w, which is approximately 60-fold more specific toward the natural substrate l-leucine than l-phenylalanine as compared with wild type. this result demonstrates the potential of our assay for the discovery of mutant aminotransferases displaying altered substrate specificity, an important goal of enzyme engineering.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of three variants of the gene encoding alkaline xylanase c from the alkaliphilic bacillus sp. (ncl 87-6-10).
AB  == alkaline xylanase c from the alkaliphilic bacillus sp. (ncl 87-6-10) has a low molecular weight and alkaline pi and is cellulase-free, properties compatible with its use in the prebleaching of pulp. we report here the cloning and sequence analysis of three variants of the gene encoding xylanase c; xyl c1, xyl c2, and xyl c3. in phylogenetic analysis, the three xylanase c variants clustered into a  single group along with other reported alkaline xylanases. residues contributing  to the alkaline ph were present in all three variants. dna and protein sequence comparison of these variants with other reported alkaline xylanases revealed silent mutations, some of which are due to codon preference in the respective organisms. the recombinant xyl c1 that was successfully expressed in e. coli bl21 (de3) had properties similar to the native enzyme.

TI  == efficacy of decontamination and sterilization of a single-use single-incision laparoscopic surgery port.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy of decontamination and sterilization of a disposable port intended for use during single-incision laparoscopy. sample: 5 material samples obtained from each of 3 laparoscopic surgery ports. procedures:  ports were assigned to undergo decontamination and ethylene oxide sterilization without bacterial inoculation (negative control port), with bacterial inoculation (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and mycobacterium fortuitum) and without decontamination and sterilization (positive control port), or with bacterial inoculation followed by decontamination and ethylene oxide sterilization (treated port). each port underwent testing 5 times; during each time, a sample of the foam portion of each port was obtained and bacteriologic culture testing was performed. bacteriologic culture scores were determined for each port sample. results: none of the treated port samples had positive bacteriologic culture results. all 5 positive control port samples had positive bacteriologic culture results. one negative control port sample had positive bacteriologic culture results; a spore-forming bacillus sp organism was cultured  from that port sample, which was thought to be an environmental contaminant. bacteriologic culture scores for the treated port samples were significantly lower than those for the positive control port samples. bacteriologic culture scores for the treated port samples were not significantly different from those for negative control port samples. conclusions and clinical relevance: results of this study indicated standard procedures for decontamination and sterilization of a single-use port intended for use during singleincision laparoscopic surgery were effective for elimination of inoculated bacteria. reuse of this port may be  safe for laparoscopic surgery of animals.

TI  == cgmolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas.
AB  == a 5.5 kda antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgmolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and c18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. by comparing the n-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgmolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [mecs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/ml), and gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and  vibrio parahaemolyticus ([mecs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/ml), without hemolytic activity. however, cgmolluscidin did not show any significant activity against candida albicans. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cgmolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (e value = 0) with only the unknown ests sequenced by c. gigas est project. tissue distribution of the cgmolluscidin mrna suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. the cgmolluscidin mrna expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with vibrio sp. this peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including lysine-lysine or lysine-arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. these results suggest that cgmolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == microalgae associated brevundimonas sp. msk 4 as the nano particle synthesizing unit to produce antimicrobial silver nanoparticles.
AB  == the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles and its antimicrobial property was studied using bacteria isolated from spirulina products. isolated bacteria were identified as bacillus sp. msk 1 (jx495945), staphylococcus sp. msk 2 (jx495946), bacillus sp. msk 3 (jx495947) and brevundimonas sp. msk 4 (jx495948). silver nanoparticles (agnps) were synthesized using bacterial culture filtrate with agno3. the initial syntheses of ag nanoparticles were characterized by uv-vis spectrophotometer (by measuring the color change to intense brown). fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) study showed evidence that proteins are possible reducing agents and energy-dispersive x-ray (edx) study showing the metal silver as major signal. the structure of agnps was determined by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and x-ray diffraction (xrd). synthesized ag nanoparticles with an average size of 40-65 nm have antimicrobial property against human pathogens like proteus vulgaris, salmonella typhi, vibrio cholera,  streptococcus sp., bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. among the isolates brevundimonas sp. msk 4 alone showed good activity in both synthesis of agnps and antimicrobial activity. this work demonstrates the possible use of biological synthesized silver nanoparticles to combat the drug resistant problem.

TI  == enhancement of catalysis and functional expression of a bacterial laccase by single amino acid replacement.
AB  == structure-function relationships underlying laccases properties are very limited  that makes these enzymes interesting for protein engineering approaches. therefore in the current study, a thermostable laccase that was isolated from bacillus sp. hr03 with the ability of bilirubin oxidation besides its laccase and tyrosinase activity is used. the extensive application of this enzyme is limited  by its low expression level in escherichia coli. based on sequence alignments and structural studies, three single amino acid substitutions, d500g, d500e, d500s and a glycine insertion, are introduced using site-directed mutagenesis to evaluate the role of asp(500) located in the c-terminal segment close to the t1 copper center. substitution of aspartic acid with less sterically hindered, conserved residue such as glycine increase kcat (2.3 fold) and total activity (7.3 fold) which is accompanied by a significant increase in the expression level up to 3 fold. biochemical characterization and structural studies using far-uv cd and fluorescence spectroscopy reveal the importance of c-terminal copper-binding  loop in the laccase functional expression and catalytic efficiency. kinetic characterization of the purified mutants toward 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (abts), syringaldazine (sgz) and bilirubin, shows that substrate specificity is left unchanged.

TI  == characterization of a new and thermostable esterase from a metagenomic library.
AB  == a new gene encoding an esterase (designated as estep16) was identified from a metagenomic library prepared from a sediment sample collected from a deep-sea hydrothermal field in east pacific. the open reading frame of this gene encoded 249 amino acid residues. it was cloned, overexpressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. the monomeric estep16 presented a molecular mass of 51.7 kda. enzyme assays using p-nitrophenyl esters  with different acyl chain lengths as the substrates confirmed its esterase activity, yielding highest specific activity with p-nitrophenyl acetate. when p-nitrophenyl butyrate was used as a substrate, recombinant estep16 exhibited highest activity at ph 8.0 and 60 degrees c. the recombinant enzyme retained about 80% residual activity after incubation at 90 degrees c for 6 h, which indicated that estep16 was thermostable. homology modeling of estep16 was developed with the monoacylglycerol lipase from bacillus sp. h-257 as a template. the structure showed an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and indicated the presence of a typical catalytic triad. the activity of estep16 was inhibited by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating that it contains serine residue, which  plays a key role in the catalytic mechanism.

TI  == synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  == biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of phb. the films were  evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, penicillium  sp., and rhizopus sp. the synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the  presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. the broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial phb film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against  the bacteria. crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial phb film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of  molds, i.e., a. niger, a. flavus, penicillium sp., and rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. in the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated phb film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the phb film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. the migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing phb film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.

TI  == an efficient in vitro refolding of recombinant bacterial laccase in escherichia coli.
AB  == laccases (benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductases, ec 1.10.3.2) are important multicopper enzymes that are used in many biotechnological processes. a recombinant form of laccase from bacillus sp. hr03 was overexpressed in escherichia coli bl-21(de3). inclusion body (ib) formation happens quite often during recombinant protein production. hence, developing a protocol for efficient refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies to provide large amounts of active protein could be advantageous for structural and functional studies. here, we have tried to find an efficient method of refolding for this bacterial enzyme. solubilization of inclusion bodies was carried out in phosphate buffer ph 7, containing 8m urea and 4mm beta-mercaptoethanol and refolding was performed using the dilution method. the effect of different additives was investigated on the refolding procedure of denaturated laccase. mix buffer (phosphate buffer and citrate buffer, 100mm) containing 4mm znso4 and 100mm sorbitol was selected as an optimized refolding buffer. also kinetic parameters of soluble and refolded laccase were analyzed.

TI  == identification of anziaic acid, a lichen depside from hypotrachyna sp., as a new  topoisomerase poison inhibitor.
AB  == topoisomerase inhibitors are effective for antibacterial and anticancer therapy because they can lead to the accumulation of the intermediate dna cleavage complex formed by the topoisomerase enzymes, which trigger cell death. here we report the application of a novel enzyme-based high-throughput screening assay to identify natural product extracts that can lead to increased accumulation of the  dna cleavage complex formed by recombinant yersinia pestis topoisomerase i as part of a larger effort to identify new antibacterial compounds. further characterization and fractionation of the screening positives from the primary assay led to the discovery of a depside, anziaic acid, from the lichen hypotrachyna sp. as an inhibitor for both y. pestis and escherichia coli topoisomerase i. in in vitro assays, anziaic acid exhibits antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis and a membrane permeable strain of e. coli. anziaic acid was also found to act as an inhibitor of human topoisomerase ii but had little effect on human topoisomerase i. this is the first report of a depside with activity as a topoisomerase poison inhibitor and demonstrates the potential  of this class of natural products as a source for new antibacterial and anticancer compounds.

TI  == improvement of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase gene expression in escherichia coli by insertion of regulatory sequences involved in the promotion of rna transcription.
AB  == regulation of rna transcription in controlling the expression of genes at promoter and terminator regions is crucial as the interaction of rna polymerase occurred at both sites. gene encoding cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (cgtase) from bacillus sp. nr5 upm isolated in the previous study was used for further construction of ptzcgt-ss, ptzcgt-bs and ptzcgt-bt expression systems for enhancement of cgtase production. the putative promoter regions, -35 and -10 sequences were found in the upstream of the mature gene start codon. whereas, long inverted repeats sequences which can form a stable stem and loop structure was found downstream of the open reading frame (orf) of bacillus sp. nr5 upm cgtase. the construction of e. coli strain harbouring ptzcgt-bs showed increment  of 3.2-fold in cgtase activity compared to the wild type producer. however, insertion of terminator downstream of cgtase gene in e. coli strain harbouring ptzcgt-bt only resulted in 4.42 % increment of cgtase production compared to e. coli strain containing ptzcgt-bs, perhaps due to low intrinsic termination efficiency. thus, it is suggested that the insertion of the putative promoter regions upstream of the coding sequence for the construction of cgtase expression system will further enhance in the recombinant enzyme production.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == biochemical basis of mercury remediation and bioaccumulation by enterobacter sp.  emb21.
AB  == the aims of this study were to isolate metal bioaccumulating bacterial strains and to study their applications in removal of environmental problematic heavy metals like mercury. five bacterial strains belonging to genera enterobacter, bacillus, and pseudomonas were isolated from oil-spilled soil. among these, one of the strains enterobacter sp. emb21 showed mercury bioaccumulation inside the cells simultaneous to its bioremediation. the bioaccumulation of remediated mercury was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray. the mercury-resistant loci in the enterobacter sp. emb21 cells were plasmid-mediated as confirmed by transformation of mercury-sensitive escherichia  coli dh5alpha by enterobacter sp. emb21 plasmid. effect of different culture parameters viz-a-viz inoculum size, ph, carbon, and nitrogen source revealed that alkaline ph and presence of dextrose and yeast extract favored better remediation. the results indicated the usefulness of enterobacter sp. emb21 for the effective remediation of mercury in bioaccumulated form. the enterobacter sp. emb21 seems promising for heavy metal remediation wherein the remediated metal can be trapped inside the cells. the process can further be developed for the synthesis of valuable high-end functional alloy, nanoparticles, or metal conjugates from the metal being remediated.

TI  == production of alpha-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in bacillus megaterium ms941 by systematic codon usage optimization.
AB  == alpha-cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase is a key enzyme in the cyclodextrin industry. the gram-positive bacterium bacillus megaterium was chosen for production of recombinant alpha-cgtase for safety concerns. successful production of heterologous alpha-cgtase was achieved by adapting the original alpha-cgt gene to the codon usage of b. megaterium by systematic codon optimization. this balanced the trna pool and reduced ribosomal traffic jams. protein expression and secretion was ensured by using the strong inducible promoter p(xyl) and the signal peptide sp(lipa). the impact of culture medium composition and induction strategies on alpha-cgtase production was systematically analyzed. production and secretion at 32 degrees c for 24 h using modified culture medium was optimal for  alpha-cgtase yield. batch- and simple fed-batch fermentation was applied to achieve a high yield of 48.9 u.ml(-1), which was the highest activity reported for a bacillus species, making this production system a reasonable alternative to escherichia coli.

TI  == a piscidin-like antimicrobial peptide from the icefish chionodraco hamatus (perciformes: channichthyidae): molecular characterization, localization and bactericidal activity.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are considered one of the most ancient components of the innate immune system. they are able to exert their protection activity against a variety of microorganisms, and are widely distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. in this paper we focused on an amp identified in the antarctic teleost chionodraco hamatus, an icefish species. the cdna sequence  of the amp, named chionodracine, is comprised of 515 bp and translates for a putative protein precursor of 80 amino acids, with a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. the structural features evidenced in the primary sequence of chionodracine lead to the inclusion of the peptide in the antimicrobial family of piscidins. the analysis by real-time pcr of the basal gene transcripts of chionodracine in different icefish tissues showed that the highest expression was found in gills,  followed by head kidney. the chionodracine expression levels in head kidney leukocytes were up-regulated in vitro both by lps and poly i:c, and in vivo by lps. a putative chionodracine mature peptide was synthesized and employed to obtain a polyclonal antiserum, which was used in immunohistochemistry of gills sections and revealed a significant positivity associated with mast cells. the bactericidal activity of the peptide was investigated and found significant against antarctic psychrophilic bacteria strains (psychrobacter sp. tad1 and ta144), the gram-positive bacillus cereus, and at a lesser extent against the gram-negative escherichia coli. interestingly, the haemolytic activity of chionodracine was tested in vitro on human erythrocytes and no significant lysis  occurred until peptide concentration of 50 mum.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == optimization of a bacillus sp signal peptide for improved recombinant protein secretion and cell viability in escherichia coli: is there an optimal signal peptide design?
AB  == recombinant protein fused to an n-terminal signal peptide can be translocated to  the periplasm and, eventually, to the extracellular medium of escherichia coli under specific conditions. in this communication, we described the use and optimization of a heterologous signal peptide (g1 signal peptide) from a bacillus sp for improved recombinant protein secretion and cell viability in e. coli. significant advantages in maintaining high cell viability and high specificity of target protein secretion were achieved by using g1 signal peptide compared to the well-known pelb signal peptide. signal peptide sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of g1 signal peptide demonstrated that an 'mkk' sequence in n-region and the presence of a helix-breaking residue at the centre of h-region are important elements for the design of an optimal signal peptide.

AB  == bacillus licheniformis gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (blggt) was fused at its c-terminal end with n-terminally truncated forms of bacillus sp. ts-23 alpha-amylase. blggt and six fusion enzymes, blggt/sbd, blggt/amydeltan476, blggt/amydeltan443, blggt/amydeltan376, blggt/amydeltan195, and blggt/amydeltan34, were over-expressed in escherichia coli m15 cells and purified to apparent homogeneity by metal-affinity chromatography. the fusion constructions had no significant effect on the autocatalytic processing of blggt. progressive decrease in the ggt activity of fusion proteins was associated with an increasing level of truncation, and only blggt/amydeltan34 reserved the amylolytic activity. the protein fusions did not alter the optimal temperature and ph of blggt. however, as compared with the parental blggt, a significant change in circular dichorism and fluorescence spectra was observed in the fusion  enzymes. thermal unfolding of blggt, blggt/amydeltan476, blggt/amydeltan443, and  blggt/amydeltan376 followed the two-state unfolding process with a transition point (t(m)) of 61.3-63.1 degrees c, whereas blggt/amydeltan195 and blggt/amydeltan34 displayed two temperature transitions at 40.6 and 46.7 degrees  c as well as at 62.8 and 62.9 degrees c, respectively. all of the fusion enzymes  exhibited the raw-starch-binding ability, and the adsorbed proteins could be eluted from the adsorbent by 50mm tris-hcl (ph 9.0) containing 2% soluble starch.

TI  == [analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  == the selective culture method and pcr-dgge technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system  constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. the results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. the upgma cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season  were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. five different sequences (df1-df5) were obtained through blast analysis and retrieval. the closest known origin groups were located as escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., proteus sp., klebsiella oxytoca, and burkholderia sp. respectively. the blastx comparison test showed that df1 closely related to the activities of the mycobacterium bacillus and the bacillus amyloliquefaciens, df2 functioned as a conservative potential atp binding protein, df3 related to the activities of the  bacillus cereus spore, df4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and df5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.

TI  == nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the cfu.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

TI  == the structure of monoacylglycerol lipase from bacillus sp. h257 reveals unexpected conservation of the cap architecture between bacterial and human enzymes.
AB  == monoacylglycerol lipases (mgls) catalyse the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol into  free fatty acid and glycerol. mgls have been identified throughout all genera of  life and have adopted different substrate specificities depending on their physiological role. in humans, mgl plays an integral part in lipid metabolism affecting energy homeostasis, signalling processes and cancer cell progression. in bacteria, mgls degrade short-chain monoacylglycerols which are otherwise toxic to the organism. we report the crystal structures of mgl from the bacterium bacillus sp. h257 (bmgl) in its free form at 1.2a and in complex with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1.8a resolution. in both structures, bmgl adopts an alpha/beta hydrolase fold with a cap in an open conformation. access to the active site residues, which were unambiguously identified from the protein structure, is facilitated by two different channels. the larger channel constitutes the highly hydrophobic substrate binding pocket with enough room to accommodate monoacylglycerol. the other channel is rather small and resembles the proposed glycerol exit hole in human mgl. molecular dynamics simulation of bmgl yielded open and closed states of the entrance channel and the glycerol exit hole. despite differences in the number of residues, secondary structure elements, and low sequence identity in the cap region, this first structure of a  bacterial mgl reveals striking structural conservation of the overall cap architecture in comparison with human mgl. thus it provides insight into the structural conservation of the cap amongst mgls throughout evolution and provides a framework for rationalising substrate specificities in each organism.

TI  == isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == biochemical characterization of a novel cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase from paenibacillus sp. 598k.
AB  == cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase (citase; ec 2.4.1.248), a member  of the glycoside hydrolase family 66 (gh66), catalyzes the intramolecular transglucosylation of dextran to produce cycloisomaltooligosaccharides (cis; cyclodextrans) of varying lengths. eight ci-producing bacteria have been found; however, citase from bacillus circulans t-3040 (citase-t3040) is the only ci-producing enzyme that has been characterized to date. in this study, we report the gene cloning, enzyme characterization, and analysis of essential asp and glu  residues of a novel citase from paenibacillus sp. 598k (citase-598k). the cit genes from t-3040 and 598k strains were expressed recombinantly, and the properties of escherichia coli recombinant enzymes were compared. the two citases exhibited high primary amino acid sequence identity (67%). the major product of citase-598k was cycloisomaltoheptaose (ci-7), whereas that of citase-t3040 was cycloisomaltooctaose (ci-8). some of the properties of citase-598k are more favorable for practical use compared with citase-t3040, i.e., the thermal stability for citase-598k (</=50 degrees c) was 10 degrees c higher than that for citase-t3040 (</=40 degrees c); the k(cat)/k(m) value of citase-598k was approximately two times higher (32.2s(-1)mm(-1)) than that of citase-t3040 (17.8s(-1)mm(-1)). isomaltotetraose was the smallest substrate for both citases.  when isomaltoheptaose or smaller substrates were used, a lag time was observed before the intramolecular transglucosylation reaction began. as substrate length  increased, the lag time shortened. catalytically important residues of citase-598k were predicted to be asp144, asp269, and glu341. these findings will  serve as a basis for understanding the reaction mechanism and substrate recognition of gh66 enzymes.

AB  == a heterologous signal peptide (sp) from bacillus sp. g1 was optimized for secretion of recombinant cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (cgtase) to the periplasmic and, eventually, extracellular space of escherichia coli. eight mutant sps were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis to improve the secretion of recombinant cgtase. m5 is a mutated sp in which replacement of an isoleucine residue in the h-region to glycine created a helix-breaking or g-turn  motif with decreased hydrophobicity. the mutant sp resulted in 110 and 94% increases in periplasmic and extracellular recombinant cgtase, respectively, compared to the wild-type sp at a similar level of cell lysis. the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies was also reduced, as determined by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamyde gel electrophoresis, when this mutated sp was used. the addition of as low as 0.08% glycine at the beginning of cell growth improved cell viability of the e. coli host. secretory production of other proteins, such as mannosidase, also showed similar improvement, as demonstrated by cgtase production, suggesting that the combination of an optimized sp and a suitable chemical additive leads to significant improvements of extracellular recombinant  protein production and cell viability. these findings will be valuable for the extracellular production of recombinant proteins in e. coli.

TI  == functional interactions between members of the repat family of insect pathogen-induced proteins.
AB  == studies on the transcriptional response to pathogens in the insect larval gut have shown the regulation of several genes after the infection. repat (response to pathogens) genes were first identified in spodoptera exigua midgut as being up-regulated in response to the exposure to bacillus thuringiensis toxins and baculovirus. recently, new members of the repat family showed a constitutive up-regulation in a b. thuringiensis-resistant population. based on a yeast two-hybrid screening, we have detected the interaction of repat1 with other members of the repat family, leading to the discovery of a new member: repat8. the functional role of this interaction was shown by following the changes of the subcellular localization of repat1 in the presence of repat8. repat1 alone was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, while the presence of repat8 led to the migration of repat1 to the nucleus. finally, analysis of the expression pattern of eight repat members has shown that b. thuringiensis-related treatments (cry1ca toxin, xentari product and an acrystalliferous strain) induced a general up-regulation of repat genes, especially of repat2. in contrast, no significant effect was detected after treatment with escherichia coli or enterococcus sp., or by the presence of microbiota in the midgut. the results suggest that the different repat genes play different roles in response to pathogens.

AB  == purpose: malachite green (mg) is used for a variety of applications but is also known to be carcinogenic and mutagenic. in this study, a novel micrococcus sp. (strain bd15) was observed to efficiently decolorize mg. the purposes of this study were to explore the optimal conditions for decolorization and to evaluate the potential use of this strain for mg decolorization. methods: optical microscope and uv-visible analyses were carried out to determine whether the decolorization was due to biosorption or biodegradation. a plackett-burman design was employed to investigate the effect of various parameters on decolorization, and response surface methodology was then used to explore the optimal decolorization conditions. kinetics analysis and antimicrobial activity tests were also performed. results: the results indicated that the decolorization by the strain was mainly due to biodegradation. concentrations of mg, urea, and yeast extract and inoculum size had significantly positive effects on mg decolorization, while concentrations of cucl(2) and mgcl(2), and temperature had  significantly negative effects. the interaction between different parameters could significantly affect decolorization, and the optimal conditions for decolorization were 1.0 g/l urea, 0.9 g/l yeast extract, 100 mg/l mg, 0.1 g/l inoculums (dry weight), and incubation at 25.2 degrees c. under the optimal conditions, 96.9% of mg was removed by the strain within 1 h, which represents highly efficient microbial decolorization. moreover, the kinetic data for decolorization fit a second-order model well, and the strain showed a good mg detoxification capability. conclusion: based on the results of this study, we propose micrococcus sp. strain bd15 as an excellent candidate strain for mg removal from wastewater.

AB  == n-acylated homoserine lactone (ahl) lactonases are capable of degrading signal molecules involved in bacterial quorum sensing and therefore represent a new approach to control bacterial infection. here a gene responsible for the ahl lactonase activity of bacillus sp. strain ai96, 753 bp in length, was cloned and  then expressed in escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence of bacillus sp. ai96 aiia (aiia(ai96)) is most similar to those of other bacillus sp. ahl lactonases (~80% sequence identity) and was consequently categorized as a member  of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily. aiia(ai96) maintains ~100% of its activity at 10 degrees c to 40 degrees c at ph 8.0, and it is very stable at 70 degrees c at ph 8.0 for at least 1 h; no other bacillus ahl lactonase has been found to be stable under these conditions. aiia(ai96) resists digestion by proteases and carp intestinal juice, and it has broad-spectrum substrate specificity. the supplementation of aiia(ai96) into fish feed by oral administration significantly attenuated aeromonas hydrophila infection in zebrafish. this is the first report of the oral administration of an ahl lactonase for the efficient control of a. hydrophila.

TI  == mutations suppressing the loss of degq function in bacillus subtilis (natto) poly-gamma-glutamate synthesis.
AB  == the degq gene of bacillus subtilis (natto), encoding a small peptide of 46 amino  acids, is essential for the synthesis of extracellular poly-gamma-glutamate (gammapga). to elucidate the role of degq in gammapga synthesis, we knocked out the degq gene in bacillus subtilis (natto) and screened for suppressor mutations  that restored gammapga synthesis in the absence of degq. suppressor mutations were found in degs, the receptor kinase gene of the degs-degu two-component system. recombinant degs-his(6) mutant proteins were expressed in escherichia coli cells and subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation assay. compared with the  wild type, mutant degs-his(6) proteins showed higher levels of autophosphorylation (r208q, m195i, l248f, and d250n), reduced autodephosphorylation (d250n), reduced phosphatase activity toward degu, or a reduced ability to stimulate the autodephosphorylation activity of degu (r208q, d249g, m195i, l248f, and d250n) and stabilized degu in the phosphorylated form. these mutant degs proteins mimic the effect of degq on wild-type degsu in vitro.  interestingly, degq stabilizes phosphorylated degs only in the presence of degu,  indicating a complex interaction of these three proteins.

TI  == anti-biofilm activity of an exopolysaccharide from a sponge-associated strain of  bacillus licheniformis.
AB  == background: secondary metabolites ranging from furanone to exo-polysaccharides have been suggested to have anti-biofilm activity in various recent studies. among these, escherichia coli group ii capsular polysaccharides were shown to inhibit biofilm formation of a wide range of organisms and more recently marine vibrio sp. were found to secrete complex exopolysaccharides having the potential  for broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition and disruption. results: in this study we report that a newly identified ca. 1800 kda polysaccharide having simple monomeric units of alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-(1-->2)-glycerol-phosphate exerts an  anti-biofilm activity against a number of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains without bactericidal effects. this polysaccharide was extracted from a bacillus licheniformis strain associated with the marine organism spongia officinalis. the mechanism of action of this compound is most likely independent  from quorum sensing, as its structure is unrelated to any of the so far known quorum sensing molecules. in our experiments we also found that treatment of abiotic surfaces with our polysaccharide reduced the initial adhesion and biofilm development of strains such as escherichia coli phl628 and pseudomonas fluorescens. conclusion: the polysaccharide isolated from sponge-associated b. licheniformis has several features that provide a tool for better exploration of  novel anti-biofilm compounds. inhibiting biofilm formation of a wide range of bacteria without affecting their growth appears to represent a special feature of the polysaccharide described in this report. further research on such surface-active compounds might help developing new classes of anti-biofilm molecules with broad spectrum activity and more in general will allow exploring of new functions for bacterial polysaccharides in the environment.

TI  == post-liberation cleavage of signal peptides is catalyzed by the site-2 protease (s2p) in bacteria.
AB  == a signal peptide (sp) is cleaved off from presecretory proteins by signal peptidase during or immediately after insertion into the membrane. in metazoan cells, the cleaved sp then receives proteolysis by signal peptide peptidase, an intramembrane-cleaving protease (i-clip). however, bacteria lack any signal peptide peptidase member i-clip, and little is known about the metabolic fate of  bacterial sps. here we show that escherichia coli rsep, an site-2 protease (s2p)  family i-clip, introduces a cleavage into sps after their signal peptidase-mediated liberation from preproteins. a bacillus subtilis s2p protease, rasp, is also shown to be involved in sp cleavage. these results uncover a physiological role of bacterial s2p proteases and update the basic knowledge about the fate of signal peptides in bacterial cells.

TI  == involvement of propeptides in formation of catalytically active metalloproteinase from thermoactinomyces sp.
AB  == the metalloproteinase from thermoactinomyces sp. 27a (mpr) represents secretory thermolysin-like metalloproteinases of the m4 family. the thermoactinomyces enzyme is synthesized as a precursor consisting of a signal peptide, n-terminal propeptide, mature region, and c-terminal propeptide. the functional molecule lacks the signal peptide, n-terminal propeptide, and c-terminal propeptide, which indicates the processing of these regions. until now, it remained unclear if the  n-terminal propeptide is involved in the formation and functioning of mpr, and the role of the c-terminal propeptide was also unclear. in this work, a bacillus  subtilis aj73 strain expressing mpr without the c-terminal propeptide- encoding region being involved has been obtained. the absence of the mpr c-terminal propeptide had no significant effect on the formation of the functional molecule  and did not interfere with the protease secretion in b. subtilis aj73 cells. strains producing the n-terminal propeptide, mature region, and mature region covalently bound to the n-terminal propeptide were generated from escherichia coli bl-21(de3) cells. functionally active mpr forms could be produced only in the presence of the n-terminal propeptide, either covalently bound to the mature  region (in cis) or as a separate molecule (in trans). thus, the mpr three-dimensional structure is formed according to the propeptide-assisted mechanism with no requirement of a covalent bond between the n-terminal propeptide and mature region. moreover, mpr variants generated in cis and in trans differed in their specificity for certain synthetic substrates.

TI  == extending the scope of site-specific cysteine bioconjugation by appending a prelabeled cysteine tag to proteins using protein trans-splicing.
AB  == incorporating synthetic probes site-specifically into proteins is of central interest in several areas of biotechnology and protein chemistry. bioconjugation  techniques provide a simple and effective means of chemically modifying a protein. in particular, covalent chemical modifications of cysteine residues belong to one of the most important reactions due to the unique reactivity of its thiol moiety and the relatively low abundance of this amino acid in proteins. however, such types of modifications cannot be performed in a regioselective fashion when one or more additional cysteines are present. to address this limitation, we have developed an approach where a short cysteine-containing tag (cys-tag) fused to one part of a split intein and modified at its sulfhydryl group can be used to label proteins by trans-splicing with a protein of interest  (poi) fused to the other half of the split intein. in this way, it is possible to selectively label a protein containing multiple cysteines. the artificially split mycobacterium xenopi gyra intein and the synechocystis sp. dnab intein were highly suitable for this purpose and were successfully used for the labeling of several proteins. this approach enables a simple route for labeling proteins by site-specific cysteine bioconjugation with any one of several commercially available cysteine-modifying probes.

TI  == cis-antisense rna, another level of gene regulation in bacteria.
AB  == a substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression  in eukaryotes. however, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. the transcriptomes of bacteria as different as helicobacter pylori, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, mycoplasma pneumoniae, sinorhizobium meliloti, geobacter sulfurreducens, vibrio cholerae, chlamydia trachomatis, pseudomonas syringae, and staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense rna (asrna) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. bacterial asrnas share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory rnas, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. here, we review recent publications indicating that asrnas occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asrna actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. emerging functional data suggest that asrnas in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. thus, the functional impact  of asrnas should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic  bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.

AB  == two escherichia coli expression systems based on t7 rna polymerase promoter (pet  system) and tac promoter (pflag system) have been used for the production and secretion of recombinant beta-mannanases from bacillus sp. both e. coli ompa signal peptide and native bacillus signal peptide could be used efficiently for the secretion of recombinant enzymes into periplasmic space and culture media. the genes could be induced for over-expression with 0.1-1 mm isopropyl-beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) when the od 600 of the culture broth reached 0.6-1.5. the recombinant enzymes could be harvested from whole cell lysate, perimplasmic extract, or culture broth after induction for 4-20 hours. since the enzyme is c-terminally tagged with hexahistidine, the recombinant enzymes could be conveniently purified to apparent homogeneity by one-step immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (imac) using ni-nta resins. the characteristics of purified recombinant beta-mannanases from b. licheniformis and b. subtilis, which share 78% amino acid identity, are slightly different. these systems should be applicable for the production of various recombinant bacterial  extracellular enzymes.

TI  == bacillus sp. cdb3 isolated from cattle dip-sites possesses two ars gene clusters.
AB  == contamination of soil and water by arsenic is a global problem. in australia, the dipping of cattle in arsenic-containing solution to control cattle ticks in last  centenary has left many sites heavily contaminated with arsenic and other toxicants. we had previously isolated five soil bacterial strains (cdb1-5) highly resistant to arsenic. to understand the resistance mechanism, molecular studies have been carried out. two chromosome-encoded arsenic resistance (ars) gene clusters have been cloned from cdb3 (bacillus sp.). they both function in escherichia coli and cluster 1 exerts a much higher resistance to the toxic metalloid. cluster 2 is smaller possessing four open reading frames (orfs) arsrorf2bc, similar to that identified in bacillus subtilis skin element. among the eight orfs in cluster 1 five are analogs of common ars genes found in other bacteria, however, organized in a unique order arsrbcda instead of arsrdabc. three other putative genes are located directly downstream and designated as arstip based on the homologies of their theoretical translation sequences respectively to thioredoxin reductases, iron-sulphur cluster proteins and protein phosphatases. the latter two are novel of any known ars operons. the arsd gene from bacillus species was cloned for the first time and the predict protein differs from the well studied e. coli arsd by lacking two pairs of c-terminal cysteine residues. its functional involvement in arsenic resistance has been confirmed by a deletion experiment. there exists also an inverted repeat in the intergenic region between arsc and arsd implying some unknown transcription regulation.

TI  == chemical, physical and microbiological changes during composting of the water hyacinth.
AB  == an investigation of the physical, chemical and microbial population changes that  occurred during the composting of water hyacinth was carried out. after 11 weeks  of composting, the compost turned black, had decomposed and had no smell. the ph  was 7 and the highest temperature reached, of 40 degrees c occurred in the first  week. the initial carbon/nitrogen ratio was 17.61 and this increased to 18.12 by  the end of the composting. the coliform population declined greatly from 8.11 to  5.85 mpn (log)/g and fecal coliforms and escherichia coli were not detected in the final product. bacteria were the dominant microbes in the compost followed by actinomycetes and fungi. mesophillic microorganisms were present in higher numbers than thermophillic microorganisms throughout the composting. the highest  cellulase and xylanase activities in the compost of 6.67 and 10.24 u/kg dw, respectively were detected in the second week which was related to the temperature. bacillus sp. strain b4 was isolated and investigated for cellulase and xylanase using agro-industrial residues as substrates during solid-state fermentation (ssf) processes. corncob and rice straw were good substrates for the production of the enzymes with a maximum cellulase of 1.19 u/gdw and xylanase activity of 2.54 u/g dw, respectively. the activities of both enzymes were stable and maximum at 50 degrees c. this study indicated that agro-industrial residues should be mixed with water hyacinth for composting to facilitate the development  of a thermophilic phase during the composting process and to improve the product. bacillus sp. strain b4 can be used as a starter strain.

TI  == characterisation of two quorum sensing systems in the endophytic serratia plymuthica strain g3: differential control of motility and biofilm formation according to life-style.
AB  == background: n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl)-based quorum sensing (qs) systems have been described in many plant-associated gram-negative bacteria to control certain beneficial phenotypic traits, such as production of biocontrol factors and plant  growth promotion. however, the role of ahl-mediated signalling in the endophytic  strains of plant-associated serratia is still poorly understood. an endophytic serratia sp. g3 with biocontrol potential and high levels of ahl signal production was isolated from the stems of wheat and the role of qs in this isolate was determined. results: strain g3 classified as serratia plymuthica based on 16s rrna was subjected to phylogenetic analysis. using primers to conserved sequences of luxir homologues from the serratia genus, splir and spsir  from the chromosome of strain g3 were cloned and sequenced. ahl profiles from strain g3 and escherichia coli dh5alpha expressing spli or spsi from recombinant  plasmids were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. this  revealed that the most abundant ahl signals produced by spli in e. coli were n-3-oxo-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (3-oxo-c6-hsl), n-3-oxo-heptanoylhomoserine lactone (3-oxo-c7-hsl), n-3-hydroxy-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (3-hydroxy-c6-hsl), n-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (c6-hsl), and n-heptanoyl homoserine lactone (c7-hsl); whereas spsi was primarily responsible for the synthesis of n-butyrylhomoserine lactone (c4-hsl) and n-pentanoylhomoserine lactone (c5-hsl). furthermore, a quorum quenching analysis by heterologous expression of the bacillus a24 aiia lactonase in strain g3 enabled the identification of the ahl-regulated biocontrol-related traits. depletion of ahls  with this lactonase resulted in altered adhesion and biofilm formation using a microtiter plate assay and flow cells coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy respectively. this was different from the closely related s. plymuthica strains hro-c48 and rvh1, where biofilm formation for both strains is  ahl-independent. in addition, qs in g3 positively regulated antifungal activity,  production of exoenzymes, but negatively regulated production of indol-3-acetic acid (iaa), which is in agreement with previous reports in strain hro-c48. however, in contrast to hro-c48, swimming motility was not controlled by ahl-mediated qs. conclusions: this is the first report of the characterisation of two ahl-based quorum sensing systems in the same isolate of the genus serratia. our results show that the qs network is involved in the global regulation of biocontrol-related traits in the endophytic strain g3. however, although free-living and endophytic s. plymuthica share some conservation on qs phenotypic regulation, the control of motility and biofilm formation seems to be strain-specific and possible linked to the life-style of this organism.

TI  == isolation and identification of soil bacteria growing at the expense of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
AB  == soil-microorganism symbioses are of fundamental importance for plant adaptation to the environment. research in microbial ecology has revealed that some soil bacteria are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (amf). however, these interactions may be much more complex than originally thought. to assess the type of bacteria associated with amf, we initially isolated spores of glomus irregulare from an agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. the spores were washed with  sterile water and plated onto g. irregulare mycelium growing in vitro in a root-free compartment of bicompartmented petri dishes. we hypothesized that this  system should select for bacteria closely associated with the fungus because the  only nutrients available to the bacteria were those derived from the hyphae. twenty-nine bacterial colonies growing on the amf hyphae were subcultured and identified using 16s rrna gene sequences. all bacterial isolates showed high sequence identity to bacillus cereus, bacillus megaterium, bacillus simplex, kocuria rhizophila, microbacterium ginsengisoli, sphingomonas sp. and variovorax  paradoxus. we also assessed bacterial diversity on the surface of spores by pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. finally, we used live cellular imaging to show that the bacteria isolated can grow on the surface of hyphae with different growing patterns in contrast to escherichia coli as a control.

AB  == in the screening of 11 e. coli strains overexpressing recombinant oxidoreductases from bacillus sp. ecu0013, an nadph-dependent aldo-keto reductase (ytbe) was identified with capability of producing chiral alcohols. the protein (ytbe) was overexpressed, purified to homogeneity, and characterized of biocatalytic properties. the purified enzyme exhibited the highest activity at 50 degrees c and optimal ph at 6.5. ytbe served as a versatile reductase showing a broad substrate spectrum towards different aromatic ketones and keto esters. furthermore, a variety of carbonyl substrates were asymmetrically reduced by the  purified enzyme with an additionally coupled nadph regeneration system. the reduction system exhibited excellent enantioselectivity (>99% ee) in the reduction of all the aromatic ketones and high to moderate enantioselectivity in  the reduction of alpha- and beta-keto esters. among the ketones tested, ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate was found to be reduced to ethyl (r)-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-hydroxy butanoate, an important pharmaceutical intermediate, in excellent optical purity. to the best of our knowledge, this is  the first report of ytbe gene-encoding recombinant aldo-keto reductase from bacillus sp. used as biocatalyst for stereoselective reduction of carbonyl compounds. this study provides a useful guidance for further application of this  enzyme in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral alcohol enantiomers.

AB  == for bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. we investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomi gene product (renamed cwlp). the gene is located in the sp-beta prophage region of the bacillus subtilis chromosome. inspection of the pfam database indicates that cwlp contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (slt) and peptidase m23 domains, which are similar to escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase slt70, and the staphylococcus aureus gly-gly endopeptidase lytm, respectively. the slt domain of cwlp exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the b. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (rp)-hplc and mass spectrometry revealed that the cwlp-slt domain has only muramidase activity. in addition, the  peptidase m23 domain of cwlp exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. remarkably, the m23 domain of cwlp possessed a unique zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized m23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to cwlp), which are zn(2+) dependent. both domains of cwlp could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of b. subtilis. however, the m23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of s. aureus or streptococcus thermophilus. the effect of defined  point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of cwlp is also determined.

TI  == isolation of culturable microorganisms from free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) from the southeastern united states.
AB  == reports of diseases in marine mammals are increasing worldwide, however our understanding of the microorganisms associated with marine mammals is still limited. in this study, we cultured bacteria and fungi isolated from the upper respiratory tract (blowhole), gastric fluid and anus of 180 wild bottlenose dolphins (tursiops truncatus) from two estuarine locations along the southeastern atlantic coast of the united states. a total of 339 and 491 isolates from charleston, sc (chs) and indian river lagoon, fl (irl) dolphins, respectively, were cultured from gastric (70 chs/82 irl), fecal (141 chs/184 irl), and blowhole (128 chs/225 irl) swabs on selective media used for routine clinical microorganisms of human concern. the most frequently cultured gram-negative bacteria from all sample and study types were plesiomonas shigelloides, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas fluorescens. among the gram-positive bacteria, clostridium perfringens, bacillus sp., and staphylococcus coag. neg were the predominant organisms. for fungi, the most abundant species were candida glabrata, budding yeasts, and candida tropicalis. of concern, the mrsa strain of staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blowhole and gastric swabs from chs dolphins. in general, a greater prevalence of bacteria and fungi (four-fold increase) were cultured from irl than chs animals. together, these culture-dependent studies, coupled to on-going culture-independent approaches, should help establish a baseline of microorganisms associated with bottlenose dolphins and aid in the identification of organisms responsible for infectious diseases(s) in these animals.

TI  == assessment of euphorbia hirta l. leaf, flower, stem and root extracts for their antibacterial and antifungal activity and brine shrimp lethality.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of the methanolic extracts of euphorbia hirta l leaves, flowers, stems and roots were evaluated against some medically important  bacteria and yeast using the agar disc diffusion method. four gram positive (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus sp., bacillus subtilis and bacillus thuringensis), four gram negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, salmonella typhi and p. mirabilis) and one yeast (candida albicans) species were  screened. inhibition zones ranged between 16-29 mm. leaves extract inhibited the  growth of all tested microorganisms with large zones of inhibition, followed by that of flowers, which also inhibited all the bacteria except c. albicans. the most susceptible microbes to all extracts were s. aureus and micrococcus sp. root extract displayed larger inhibition zones against gram positive bacteria than gram negative bacteria and had larger inhibition zones compared to stem extract.  the lowest mic values were obtained with e. coli and c. albicans (3.12 mg/ml), followed by s. aureus (12.50 mg/ml) and p. mirabilis (50.00 mg/ml). all the other bacteria had mic values of 100.00 mg/ml. scanning electron microscopic (sem) studies revealed that the cells exposed to leaf extract displayed a rough surface with multiple blends and invaginations which increased with increasing time of treatment, and cells exposed to leaf extract for 36 h showed the most damage, with abundant surface cracks which may be related to final cell collapse and loss of function. time-kill assay of c. albicans indicated a primarily fungicidal effect at 1- and 2-fold mic. e. hirta extracts had lc(50) values of 0.71, 0.66, 0.41 and 0.03 mg/ml for stems, leaves, roots and flowers, respectively against artemia salina. hence, these plants can be used to discover new bioactive natural products that may serve as leads in the development of new pharmaceuticals.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a nocardiopsis sp. from honeybee guts.
AB  == although actinomycetes are the plant-associated environmental bacteria best known for producing thousands of antibiotics, their presence in the guts of flower-feeding honeybees has rarely been reported. here, we report on the selective isolation of actinomycetes from the gut microbiota of healthy honeybees, and their inhibitory activity against honeybee indigenous bacteria. more than 70% of the sampled honeybees (n>40) in a season carried at least one cfu of actinomycete. the isolates from bees of one location produced inhibitory bioactivities that were almost exclusively against several bee indigenous bacillus strains and gram-positive human pathogens but not escherichia coli. an antibiotic-producing actinomycete closely related to nocardiopsis alba was isolated from the guts in every season of the year. a dna fragment encoding a homologous gene (phzd) involved in phenazine biosynthesis was identified in the isolate. expression of the phzd detected by reverse transcription-pcr can explain the survival of this organism in anaerobic environments as some redox-active extracellular phenazines are commonly regarded as respiratory electron acceptors. the results raise important questions concerning the roles of the antibiotic-producing actinomycetes and the phenazine-like molecules in honeybee guts and honey.

TI  == synthesis of optically pure s-sulfoxide by escherichia coli transformant cells coexpressing the p450 monooxygenase and glucose dehydrogenase genes.
AB  == a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase (p450smo) from rhodococcus sp. can catalyze asymmetric oxygenation of sulfides to s-sulfoxides. however, p450smo-catalyzed biotransformations require a constant supply of nad(p)h, the expense of which constitutes a great hindrance for this enzyme application. in this study, we investigated the asymmetric oxygenation of sulfide to s-sulfoxide using e. coli cells, which co-express both the p450smo gene from rhodococcus sp. and the glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) gene from bacillus subtilis, as a catalyst. the results showed that the catalytic performance of co-expression systems was markedly improved compared to the system lacking gdh. when using recombinant e. coli bl21 (pet28a-p450-gdh) whole cell as a biocatalyst, nadph was efficiently regenerated when glucose was supplemented in the reaction system. a total conversion of 100% was achieved within 12 h with 2 mm p-chlorothioanisole substrate, affording 317.3 mg/l s-sulfoxide obtained. when the initial sulfide concentration was increased to 5 mm, the substrate conversion was also increased  nearly fivefold: s-sulfoxide amounted to 2.5 mm (396.6 mg/l) and the ee value of  sulfoxide product exceeded 98%. in this system, the effects of glucose concentration and substrate concentration were further investigated for efficient biotransformation. this system is highly advantageous for the synthesis of optically pure s-sulfoxide.

TI  == characterization of a dual specificity aryl acid adenylation enzyme with dual function in nikkomycin biosynthesis.
AB  == nikkomycin z is a dipeptide antifungal antibiotic characterized by two nonproteinogenic amino acids, nikkomycin c(z) and 4-(4'-hydroxy-2'-pyridinyl)-homothreonine (hpht). the hpht scaffold is assembled  by an aldol reaction between 2-oxobutyrate and picolinaldehyde, the latter of which is derived from picolinic acid that is activated and loaded to coenzyme a by the aryl-activating adenylation enzyme, nike. we now provide evidence that nike is also involved in the activation and loading of the alpha-keto acid precursor, 4-(2'-pyridinyl)-2-oxo-4-hydroxyisovalerate (pohiv), to a phosphopantetheinyl group of an acyl carrier protein domain of nikt. pohiv was synthesized using escherichia coli 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase, and phenylalanine dehydrogenase from bacillus sp. nrrl b-14911 was used to prepare the alpha-amino acid, 4-(2'-pyridinyl)-homothreonine (pht). using the carboxylic acid-dependent, atp-[(32)p]pp(i) exchange assay, nike is shown to activate both picolinic acid and pohiv but not pht. furthermore, nike loads pohiv to holo-nikt to generate a new thioester-linked intermediate, which was not observed using a nikt(s33a) mutant. thus, nike activates two distinct carboxylic  acids to form two new thioester intermediates, one of which is subsequently reduced to the aldehyde and the other that likely serves as a substrate for the aminotransferase domain of nikt prior to condensation with nikkomycin c(z) to yield the dipeptide.

TI  == genome-wide identification and expression analysis of serine proteases and homologs in the silkworm bombyx mori.
AB  == background: serine proteases (sps) and serine proteases homologs (sphs) are a large group of proteolytic enzymes, with important roles in a variety of physiological processes, such as cell signalling, defense and development. genome-wide identification and expression analysis of serine proteases and their  homologs in the silkworm might provide valuable information about their biological functions. results: in this study, 51 sp genes and 92 sph genes were systematically identified in the genome of the silkworm bombyx mori. phylogenetic analysis indicated that six gene families have been amplified species-specifically in the silkworm, and the members of them showed chromosomal  distribution of tandem repeats. microarray analysis suggests that many silkworm-specific genes, such as members of sp_fam12, 13, 14 and 15, show expression patterns that are specific to tissues or developmental stages. the roles of sps and sphs in resisting pathogens were investigated in silkworms when  they were infected by escherichia coli, bacillus bombysepticus, batrytis bassiana and b. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus, respectively. microarray experiment and real-time quantitative rt-pcr showed that 18 sp or sph genes were significantly up-regulated after pathogen induction, suggesting that sp and sph genes might participate in pathogenic microorganism resistance in b. mori. conclusion: silkworm sp and sph genes were identified. comparative genomics showed that sp and sph genes belong to a large family, whose members are generated mainly by tandem repeat evolution. we found that silkworm has species-specific sp and sph genes. phylogenetic and microarray analyses provide an overview of the silkworm sp and sphs, and facilitate future functional studies on these enzymes.

AB  == an edible-oil degrading bacterial strain hh-01 was isolated from oil plant gummy  matter and was classified as a member of the genus bacillus on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene. a putative lipase gene and its flanking regions were cloned from the strain based on its similarity to lipase genes from  other bacillus spp. the deduced product was composed of 214 amino acids and the putative mature protein, consisting of 182 amino acids, exhibited 82% amino acid  sequence identity with the subfamily i.4 lipase lipa of bacillus subtilis 168. the recombinant product was successfully overproduced as a soluble form in escherichia coli and showed lipase activity. the gene was, therefore, designated  as lipa of hh-01. hh-01 lipa was stable at ph 4-11 and up to 30 degrees c, and its optimum ph and temperature were 8-9 and 30 degrees c, respectively. the enzyme showed preferential hydrolysis of the 1(3)-position ester bond in trilinolein. the activity was, interestingly, enhanced by supplementing with 1 mm cocl(2), in contrast to other bacillus lipases. the lipa gene seemed to be constitutively transcribed during the exponential growth phase, regardless of the presence of edible oil.

AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.

AB  == actinomycetes are gram-positive bacteria with a complex life cycle. they produce  many pharmaceutically relevant secondary metabolites, including antibiotics and anticancer drugs. however, there is a limited number of biotechnological applications available as opposed to genetic model organisms like bacillus subtilis or escherichia coli. we report here a system for the functional expression of a synthetic gene encoding the i-scei homing endonuclease in several streptomycetes. using the synthetic sce(a) gene, we were able to create controlled genomic dna double-strand breaks. a mutagenesis system, based on the homing endonuclease i-scei, has been developed to construct targeted, non-polar,  unmarked gene mutations in streptomyces sp. tu6071. in addition, we have shown that homologous recombination is a major pathway in streptomycetes to repair an i-scei-generated dna double-strand break. this novel i-scei-based tool will be useful in fundamental studies on the repair mechanism of dna double-strand breaks and for a variety of biotechnological applications.

AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of the marine bacterium pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3j6.
AB  == biofilm formation results in medical threats or economic losses and is therefore  a major concern in a variety of domains. in two-species biofilms of marine bacteria grown under dynamic conditions, pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3j6 formed  mixed biofilms with bacillus sp. strain 4j6 but was largely predominant over paracoccus sp. strain 4m6 and vibrio sp. strain d01. the supernatant of pseudoalteromonas sp. 3j6 liquid culture (sn(3j6)) was devoid of antibacterial activity against free-living paracoccus sp. 4m6 and vibrio sp. d01 cells, but it  impaired their ability to grow as single-species biofilms and led to higher percentages of nonviable cells in 48-h biofilms. antibiofilm molecules of sn(3j6) were able to coat the glass surfaces used to grow biofilms and reduced bacterial  attachment about 2-fold, which might partly explain the biofilm formation defect  but not the loss of cell viability. sn(3j6) had a wide spectrum of activity since it affected all gram-negative marine strains tested except other pseudoalteromonas strains. biofilm biovolumes of the sensitive strains were reduced 3- to 530-fold, and the percentages of nonviable cells were increased 3-  to 225-fold. interestingly, sn(3j6) also impaired biofilm formation by three strains belonging to the human-pathogenic species pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli. such an antibiofilm activity is original and opens up a variety of applications for pseudoalteromonas sp. 3j6 and/or its active exoproducts in biofilm prevention strategies.

AB  == the significance of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) on cell transport and retained bacteria profiles in packed porous media (quartz sand) was examined  by direct comparison of the overall deposition kinetics and retained profiles of  untreated bacteria (with eps) versus those of treated cells (without eps) from the same cell type. four representative cell types, pseudomonas sp. qg6 (gram-negative, motile), mutant escherichia coli bl21 (gram-negative, nonmotile), bacillus subtilis (gram-positive, motile), and rhodococcus sp. ql2 (gram-positive, nonmotile), were employed to systematically determine the influence of eps on cell transport and deposition behavior. packed column experiments were conducted for the untreated and treated cells in both nacl (four ionic strength ranging from 2.5 mm to 20 mm) and cacl(2) (5 mm) solutions at ph 6.0. the breakthrough plateaus of untreated bacteria were lower than those of treated bacteria for all four cell types under all examined conditions (in both nacl and cacl(2) solutions), indicating that the presence of eps on cell surfaces enhanced cell deposition in porous media regardless of cell type and motility. retained profiles of both untreated and treated cells for all four cell types deviated from classic filtration theory (log-linear decreases). however, the degree of deviation was greater for all four untreated cells, indicating that the presence of eps on cell surfaces increased the deviation of retained profiles from classic filtration theory. elution experiments demonstrated that neither untreated nor treated cells preferentially deposited in secondary energy minima.  furthermore, the release of previously deposited cells in the secondary energy minima did not change the shape of retained cell profiles, indicating that deposition in secondary energy minima did not produce the observed deviations of  retained profiles from classic filtration theory.

TI  == streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov., a lactic acid-producing streptomycete isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants.
AB  == a novel actinomycete, designated strain gimn4.001(t), was isolated from the rhizosphere of tomato plants grown in guangzhou, china. the strain produced greyish white aerial mycelia, lactic acid and a large quantity of double diamond-shaped crystals on potato dextrose agar and yeast extract-malt extract agar. the colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to ph. microscopic observations revealed that strain gimn4.001(t) produced verticillate chains of cylindrical spores. chemotaxonomic data confirmed that strain gimn4.001(t) belonged to the genus streptomyces. melanin pigments were not produced. no antibacterial activity was observed against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis or candida albicans, but inhibitory activity was observed against penicillium citrinum. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that strain gimn4.001(t) was related most closely to streptomyces morookaense atcc 19166(t) (98.9 % similarity) and streptomyces lavenduligriseus atcc 13306(t) (98.7 %). levels of dna-dna relatedness between strain gimn4.001(t) and the type  strains of these species were low (14-20 %). furthermore, strain gimn4.001(t) could be differentiated from s. morookaense, s. lavenduligriseus and other closely related species of the genus streptomyces based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. on the basis of its physiological  and molecular properties, strain gimn4.001(t) is considered to represent a novel  species of the genus streptomyces, for which the name streptomyces lacticiproducens sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is gimn4.001(t) (=cctcc m208214(t)=nrrl b-24800(t)).

TI  == the swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (stasp-psi) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  == plant-specific insert domain (psi) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (ap) precursors. psi is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the n- and c-terminal portions of the  saposin like domain. hence, psi is called a swaposin domain. here, we report the  cloned, heterologous expression and purification of psi from stasp 1 (solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called stasp-psi. results obtained here show that stasp-psi is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. as reported for staps (s. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the stasp-psi ability to kill microbial pathogens  is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the saplip family, stasp-psi and staps are cytotoxic to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. the amino acid residues conserved in sp_b (pulmonary surfactant protein b) and stasp-psi could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by stasp-psi and staps against gram-positive bacteria. these results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the psi domain in mature staps could be related to their antimicrobial activity.

TI  == effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  == vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  mpa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees c for up to 35 days. weissella viridescens was found to be  the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 mpa. none of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. studies on a typical w. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 mpa. agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including strains of clostridium botulinum, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. the selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this weissella sp. could be advantageous in  extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.

TI  == glucose 6-phosphate accumulation in mycobacteria: implications for a novel f420-dependent anti-oxidant defense system.
AB  == glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) is a metabolic intermediate with many possible cellular fates. in mycobacteria, g6p is a substrate for an enzyme, f(420)-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (fgd), found in few bacterial genera. intracellular g6p levels in six mycobacterium sp. were remarkably higher ( approximately 17-130-fold) than escherichia coli and bacillus megaterium. the high g6p level in mycobacterium smegmatis may result from 10-25-fold higher activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase when grown on glucose, glycerol, or acetate compared with b. megaterium and e. coli. in m. smegmatis this coincided with up-regulation of the first gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, when acetate was the carbon source, suggesting a cellular program for maintaining high g6p levels. g6p was depleted in cells under oxidative stress induced by redox cycling agents plumbagin and menadione, whereas an fgd mutant of m. smegmatis used g6p less well under such conditions. the fgd mutant was more sensitive to these agents and, in contrast to wild type,  was defective in its ability to reduce extracellular plumbagin and menadione. these data suggest that intracellular g6p in mycobacteria serves as a source of reducing power and, with the mycobacteria-specific fgd-f(420) system, plays a protective role against oxidative stress.

TI  == a thermostable phytase from bacillus sp. md2: cloning, expression and high-level  production in escherichia coli.
AB  == phytase is used as a feed additive for degradation of antinutritional phytate, and the enzyme is desired to be highly thermostable for it to withstand feed formulation conditions. a bacillus sp. md2 showing phytase activity was isolated, and the phytase encoding gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant phytase exhibited high stability at temperatures up to 100 degrees c. a higher enzyme activity was obtained when the gene expression was done in the presence of calcium chloride. production of the enzyme by batch- and fed-batch cultivation in a bioreactor was studied. in batch cultivation, maintaining dissolved oxygen at 20-30% saturation and depleting inorganic phosphate below 1 mm prior to induction by iptg resulted in over 10 u/ml phytase activity. for fed-batch cultivation, glucose concentration was maintained at 2-3 g/l, and the phytase expression was increased to 327 u/ml. induction using lactose during fed-batch cultivation showed a lag phase of 4 h prior to an increase in the phytase activity to 71 u/ml during the same period as iptg-induced production. up to 90% of the total amount of expressed phytase leaked out from the e. coli cells in both iptg- and lactose-induced fed-batch cultivations.

TI  == microbiologic evaluation of gallbladder bile of healthy dogs and dogs with iatrogenic hypercortisolism: a pilot study.
AB  == background: in people, hypercortisolism (hc) has been associated with acalculous  cholecystitis and biliary dyskinesia, which may potentiate ascending biliary infections. in dogs, an association between hc and gallbladder disease recently has been documented, although the role of bacteria remains controversial. furthermore, there is no information on the gallbladder bile microbial flora in healthy dogs. objectives: to investigate the microbial flora in gallbladder bile  in healthy dogs, the relationship between iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism and bactibilia and possible changes in biliary microbial flora after cortisol withdrawal in dogs. animals: six control dogs and 6 dogs treated with hydrocortisone. methods: gallbladder bile obtained by percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was cultured aerobically and anaerobically and examined cytologically before (d0), during (d28, d56, d84), and after (d28p,  d56p, d84p) administration of hydrocortisone (8 mg/kg po q12h). results: in the control group, 2/42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (enterococcus sp.; escherichia coli on d0) and 1/42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d28). in the hc group, 2/42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (enterococcus sp. on d28; bacillus sp. on d28p) and 3/42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d84, d84, d28p). all dogs remained healthy throughout the study period (168d). conclusions and clinical importance: based on the results of conventional bacterial culture techniques, gallbladder bile of healthy dogs periodically may harbor bacteria, which do not appear to be clinically relevant.  a 3-month period of iatrogenic hc was not associated with bactibilia. a higher prevalence of bactibilia may be detected with micromolecular techniques.

TI  == molecular cloning, over expression, and activity studies of a peptidic hiv-1 protease inhibitor: designed synthetic gene to functional recombinant peptide.
AB  == the aspartic protease inhibitor (atbi) purified from a bacillus sp. is a potent inhibitor of several proteases including recombinant hiv-1 protease, pepsin, and  fungal aspartic protease. in this study, we report the cloning, and over expression of a synthetic gene coding for atbi in escherichia coli and establish  a purification protocol. the atbi molecule consists of eleven amino acids and is  peptidic in nature. we used the peptide sequence data of atbi to synthesize complementary oligonucleotides, which were annealed and subsequently cloned in-frame with the gene for glutathione-s-transferase (gst). the expression of the resulting fusion protein was induced in e. coli bl21-a1 cells using arabinose. the recombinant peptide was purified using a reduced glutathione column, and cleaved with factor xa to remove the gst tag. the resultant product was further purified to homogeneity using rp-hplc. mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that the purified peptide had a molecular weight of 1186da which matches the theoretical molecular weight of the amino acids present in the synthetic gene. the recombinant peptide was found to be active in vitro against hiv-1 protease, pepsin, and fungal aspartic protease. the protocol described in this study may be used to clone pharmaceutically important peptide molecules.

AB  == paenibacillus sp. (formerly bacillus macerans) strain jj-1b is able to grow on 4-hydroxybenzoate (4hb) as a sole source of carbon and energy and is known to degrade 4hb via the protocatechuate (pca) 2,3-cleavage pathway. however, none of  the genes involved in this pathway have been identified. in this study, we identified and characterized the jj-1b genes for the 4hb catabolic pathway via the pca 2,3-cleavage pathway, which consisted of prar and praabegfdchi. based on  the enzyme activities of cell extracts of escherichia coli carrying prai, praa, prah, prab, prac, and prad, these genes were found to code for 4hb 3-hydroxylase, pca 2,3-dioxygenase, 5-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase, 2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, 4-oxalocrotonate (oca) tautomerase, and oca decarboxylase, respectively, which are involved in the conversion of 4hb into 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate (hpd). the prae, praf, and prag gene products exhibited 45 to 61% amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding enzymes responsible for the catabolism of hpd to pyruvate and acetyl coenzyme a. the deduced amino acid sequence of prar showed similarity with those of iclr-type transcriptional regulators. reverse transcription-pcr analysis revealed that praabegfdchi constitute an operon, and these genes were expressed during the growth of jj-1b on 4hb and pca. prar-praabegfdchi conferred the ability to grow on 4hb to e. coli, suggesting that praegf were functional for the conversion of hpd to pyruvate and acetyl coenzyme a. a promoter analysis suggested that prar encodes a repressor of the pra operon.

TI  == improvement of extracellular production of a thermophilic subtilase expressed in  escherichia coli by random mutagenesis of its n-terminal propeptide.
AB  == limited secretion capacity remains a drawback of using escherichia coli as the host for the production of recombinant proteins. in this report, random mutagenesis was performed within the n-terminal propeptide of thermostable wf146  protease, a subtilase from thermophilic bacillus sp. wf146, generating a variant  named wbm(mt) with improved capacity for extracellular production when expressed  in e. coli. two mutations, l(-57)q and e(-10)d, were identified within the n-terminal propeptide. the amount of wbm(mt) in the culture medium was found to be about three times higher than that of wild type. besides, the introduction of  mutations l(-57)q/e(-10)d into the n-terminal propeptide also accelerated the maturation of the enzyme. biochemical analysis indicated that the thermostability and the catalytic activity of mature wbm(mt) were similar to those of wild type.  far-uv cd spectra analysis and limited proteolysis experiments suggested that the mutations l(-57)q/e(-10)d resulted in a structural change in the n-terminal propeptide of the proform, and the n-terminal propeptide became more flexible, which might be beneficial for the proform to keep in a translocation-competent state. our result indicates that n-terminal propeptide engineering may be a valuable approach for improving extracellular production of recombinant subtilases expressed in e. coli.

(3) and unidentified bacteria (1). conclusions: recycled paperboard contained high populations of bacteria, and a positive correlation was found between recycle content and bacterial populations. escherichia coli, salmonella, shigella or confirmed coliform bacteria were not found in any product. significance and impact of the study: populations of bacteria did not differ significantly from original counts  over a 4-month period of dry storage, indicating that bacteria persist in paperboard over long periods and may re-enter the recycling process. the predominance of heat-tolerant endospore-forming bacteria explains the high bacteria counts found in paperboard made from recycled materials.

TI  == photodynamic treatment: a novel method for sanitation of food handling and food processing surfaces.
AB  == the photodynamic bactericidal effect of the photoactive dyes acriflavine neutral, rose bengal, phloxine b, and malachite green (oxalate salt) at concentrations of  5 to 5,000 microg/ml against two gram-negative strains (escherichia coli ljh 128  and salmonella typhimurium c1058), two gram-positive strains (bacillus sp. c578 and listeria monocytogenes ljh 375), and yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae c1172) was investigated. incubation of the investigated bacteria with acriflavine neutral under illumination resulted in a significant reduction in cell numbers compared with dark incubation. rose bengal caused a significant killing effect for bacteria incubated both in the dark and under illumination. malachite green was active against gram-positive bacteria under illumination and did not affect gram-negative bacteria or yeasts. incubation with phloxine b resulted in a significant decline in cell numbers for gram-positive bacteria, both in the dark  and under illumination; gram-negative bacteria and yeasts were unaffected. conjugation of rose bengal and phloxine b with poly(vinyl amine) resulted in an enhanced bactericidal effect during both dark and light incubation. this was explained by electrostatic interaction of the polymer with the cell surface, which resulted in closer contact of the photoactive dye and cell. no killing effect was observed for yeasts incubated with dye conjugates. filter paper treated with dye-poly(vinyl amine) conjugates showed high photodynamic bactericidal activity against the bacterial strains, but not against the yeasts.  the extent of bacterial killing depended on the nature and concentration of the dye conjugate and the type of microorganism. the presented data suggest that a photodynamic approach for constructing "self-decontaminating" materials has potential.

TI  == new thioureides of 2-(4-methylphenoxymethyl) benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro, by means of qualitative and quantative methods, the antimicrobial activity of some new synthesized chemical compounds previously solubilized in dmf (dimethyl formamide). the qualitative screening of the susceptibility spectra of different microbial strains versus these compounds was performed by three adaptated diffusion methods: paper filter  disk impregnation with the tested substances solutions, the disposal of tested solutions in agar wells and the spotting of tested solutions on solid medium previously inoculated with microbial suspension. the quantitative assay of the antimicrobial activity was performed by broth microdilution method in 96-well microplates in order to establish the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic).the  antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive strains (staphylococcus)  aureus sp., bacillus subtilis sp.), gram-negative (escherichia coli sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa sp., klebsiella pneumonia sp.) and fungal strains (candida albicans sp, aspergillus nige rsp.). all tests were performed by comparison with  the reference strains: k. pneumoniae ic 13420, e. coli ic 13529, s. aureus ic 13204, p. aeruginosa ic 13202, b. subtilis ic 12488, c. albicans ic 249, a. niger ic 13534. our results indicated that the tested compounds exhibited specific antimicrobial activity, the highest activity being noticed against planktonic fungal cells (mic ranging from 62.5 microg to 15.6 microg), followed by p. aeruginosa (mics from 250 microg to 31.5 microg). only few compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae. antimicrobial activity  against gram positive bacteria was noticed for the most of the tested compounds,  five of them exhibiting very low mic values (mics from 1000 microg to 62.5 microg).

TI  == influence of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) on deposition kinetics of bacteria.
AB  == the significance of extracellular polymer substances (eps) on cell deposition on  silica surfaces was examined by direct comparison of the deposition kinetics of untreated "intact" bacteria versus those from the same strain but with eps removal via cation exchange resin (cer) treatment using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (qcm-d). four bacterial strains, mutant escherichia coli bl21 (gram-negative, nonmotile), pseudomonas sp qg6 (gram-negative, motile), rhodococcus sp ql2 (gram-positive, nonmotile), and bacillus subtilis (gram-positive, motile), were employed to determine the influence of eps on cell  deposition. experiments were conducted in both monovalent (nacl) and divalent (cacl2) solutions under a variety of environmentally relevant ionic strength ranging from 1 to 100 mm at ph 6.0. the effectiveness of eps removal via cer method was ensured by biochemical composition analysis of eps solutions and further confirmed by ftir analysis. comparable zeta potentials were observed for  untreated and cer treated bacterial cells in both nacl and cacl2 solutions, indicating that removal of eps from cell surfaces via cer treatment did not affect the electrokinetic properties of the cell surfaces for all four strains. however, observed deposition efficiencies (alpha) were greater for untreated cells relative to those with cer treated cells across the entire ionic strength range examined in both naci and cacl2 solutions for all four bacterial strains. these results strongly demonstrated that the removal of eps from cell surfaces for all four strains decreased the deposition of bacteria on silica surfaces. this study clearly showed that the enhancement of cell deposition on silica surfaces due to the presence of eps on cell surfaces was relevant to all bacterial strains examined regardless of cell types and motility.

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

TI  == the rapid evolution of signal peptides is mainly caused by relaxed selection on non-synonymous and synonymous sites.
AB  == the precursor of a secretory protein usually contains an n-terminal signal peptide (sp), which directs the protein to cross the membrane. we performed a genome-wide analysis of secretory proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and found that signal peptides evolved faster than mature proteins. to determine whether the evolutionary pattern could be explained by selective pressure changes, we studied the amino acid replacements in signal peptides. we found that they tend to be more conserved than those in mature regions of the proteins, suggesting relaxed selective pressure acting on non-synonymous sites. this is potentially explained by similar biochemical requirements of signal peptides. we  also observed a decreased codon adaptation index (cai), suggesting a relaxed purifying selection on synonymous sites of signal peptides. in addition, the evolutionary rate of signal sequences increases with codon usage bias, suggesting that increased rare codon frequency in signal peptides is a result of natural selection to improve secretion efficiency. evidence also suggests signal peptides might have undergone positive selection. in summary, the evolution of signal peptides may be caused by a mixture of selection forces, primarily relaxation of  purifying selection.

TI  == ingestion of bacteria overproducing dnak attenuates vibrio infection of artemia franciscana larvae.
AB  == feeding of bacterially encapsulated heat shock proteins (hsps) to invertebrates is a novel way to limit vibrio infection. as an example, ingestion of escherichia coli overproducing prokaryotic hsps significantly improves survival of gnotobiotically cultured artemia larvae upon challenge with pathogenic vibrio campbellii. the relationship between hsp accumulation and enhanced resistance to  infection may involve dnak, the prokaryotic equivalent to hsp70, a major molecular chaperone in eukaryotic cells. in support of this proposal, heat-stressed bacterial strains lvs 2 (bacillus sp.), lvs 3 (aeromonas hydrophila), lvs 8 (vibrio sp.), gr 8 (cytophaga sp.), and gr 10 (roseobacter sp.) were shown in this work to be more effective than nonheated bacteria in protecting gnotobiotic artemia larvae against v. campbellii challenge. immunoprobing of western blots and quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay revealed that the amount of dnak in bacteria and their ability to enhance larval resistance to infection by v. campbellii are correlated. although the function of dnak is uncertain, it may improve tolerance to v. campbellii via immune stimulation, a possibility of significance from a fundamental perspective  and also because it could be applied in aquaculture, a major method of food production.

AB  == the soil microorganism myxobacter sp. al-1 regulates in a differential manner the production of five extracellular cellulases during its life cycle. the nucleotide sequence of a cel9-cel48 cluster from the genome of this microorganism was recently obtained. cel48 was expressed in escherichia coli to generate a his(6)-cel48 protein and the biochemical properties of the pure protein were determined. cel48 was more efficient in degrading acid-swollen avicel (asc) than  carboxymethylcellulose (cmc). on the other hand, cel9 was expressed in bacillus subtilis from an iptg-inducible promoter. zymogram analysis showed that after iptg-induction, cel9 existed in both the cell fraction and the culture medium of  b. subtilis and the secreted protein was purified to homogeneity by fplc-ionic exchange chromatography. the exocellobiohydrolase cel48 showed a synergism of 1.68 times with the endocellulase cel9 during asc degradation using an 8.1-fold excess of cel48 over cel9. western blot analysis revealed that both proteins were synthesized and secreted to the culture medium of myxobacter sp. al-1. these results show that the cel9-cel48 cluster encodes functional endo- and exo-acting  cellulases that allows myobacter sp. al-1 to hydrolyse cellulose.

TI  == myxotyrosides a and b, unusual rhamnosides from myxococcus sp.
AB  == myxobacteria are gliding bacteria of the delta-subdivision of the proteobacteria  and known for their unique biosynthetic capabilities. two examples of a new class of metabolites, myxotyrosides a (1) and b (2), were isolated from a myxococcus sp. the myxotyrosides have a tyrosine-derived core structure glycosylated with rhamnose and acylated with unusual fatty acids such as (z)-15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic and (z)-2-hexadecenoic acid. the fatty acid profile  of the investigated myxococcus sp. (strain 131) is that of a typical myxobacterium with a high similarity to those described for m. fulvus and m. xanthus, with significant concentrations of neither 15-methyl-2-hexadecenoic acid nor 2-hexadecenoic acid being detected.

TI  == phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activities of fungi associated with haliclona simulans isolated from irish coastal waters.
AB  == the diversity and antimicrobial activities of 80 fungi isolated from haliclona simulans were assessed using different fungal media containing either agar or gellum gum. in total, 19 different genotypes were detected. these fungal isolates could be classified as members of the agaricomycotina, mucoromycotina, saccharomycotina, and pezizomycotina, although the majority of the isolates were  associated with the latter class. some of these fungal isolates showed antimicrobial inhibition of escherichia coli, bacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus, and candida glabrata. fungal 18s rrna gene sequences belonging to eurotiales, calosphaeriales, and chaetothyriales were amplified from dna and rna  extracted from this marine sponge. this study indicates that in contrast to the low diversity of fungi detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr amplification from extracts of this marine sponge, a much  higher diversity of fungi could be cultured. the data suggests that some fungi live in symbiosis with h. simulans, whereas other fungi may have been ingested from the surrounding seawater.

TI  == inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it  was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was  intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e.  coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307  lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and  a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.

TI  == engineering of the alpha-amylase from geobacillus stearothermophilus us100 for detergent incorporation.
AB  == amyus100deltaig is a variant of the most thermoactive and thermostable maltohexaose forming alpha-amylase produced by geobacillus stearothermophilus sp.us100. this enzyme which was designed to improve the thermostability of the wild-type enzyme has acquired a very high resistance to chelator agents. according to modeling structural studies and with the aim of enhancing its resistance towards chemical oxidation, a mutant (amyus100deltaig/m197a) was created by substituting methionine 197 to alanine. the catalytic proprieties of the resulting mutant show alterations in the specific activity and the profile of starch hydrolysis. interestingly, amyus100deltaig/m197a displayed the highest resistance to oxidation compared to the amyus100deltaig and to termamyl300, the well-known commercial amylase used in detergent. further, performance of the engineered alpha-amylase was estimated in the presence of commonly used detergent compounds and a wide range of commercial detergent (liquid and solid). these studies indicated a high compatibility and performance of amyus100deltaig/m197a,  suggesting its potential application in detergent industry.

TI  == artificial plasmid engineered to simulate multiple biological threat agents.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a non-virulent simulant to replace several virulent organisms during the development of detection and identification methods for biological threat agents. we identified and selected specific genes to detect yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, burkholderia mallei, burkholderia pseudomallei, rickettsia sp., coxiella burnetii, brucella sp., enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, bacillus anthracis, and variola (smallpox) virus. we then designed and engineered a non-infectious simulant that  included the nucleic-acid signature of each microorganism in a single chimerical  molecule. here, we reported an approach that by direct (de novo) chemical synthesis permitted the production of a single chimerical construct 2,040 bp long that included the nucleic-acid signature of the bacterial and viral biological threat agents listed above without requiring access to these agents. sequences corresponding to each one of the biological agents in the synthetic simulant were amplified by pcr, resulting in amplicons of the expected length, of similar intensity, and without any detectable unspecific products. the novel simulant described here could reduce the need for infectious agents in the development of  detection and diagnostic methods and should also be useful as a non-virulent positive control in nucleic-acid-based tests against biological threat agents.

TI  == endophytic actinomycetes from azadirachta indica a. juss.: isolation, diversity,  and anti-microbial activity.
AB  == endophytic actinomycetes from azadirachta indica a. juss. were screened and evaluated for their anti-microbial activity against an array of pathogenic fungi  and bacteria. a total of 55 separate isolates were obtained from 20 plants, and 60% of these showed inhibitory activity against one or more pathogenic fungi and  bacteria. actinomycetes were most commonly recovered from roots (54.5% of all isolates), followed by stems (23.6%), and leaves (21.8%). the dominant genus was  streptomyces (49.09% of all isolates), while streptosporangium (14.5%), microbispora (10.9%), streptoverticillium (5.5%), sacchromonospora sp. (5.5%), and nocardia (3.6%) were also recovered. streptomyces isolates azr 006, 011, and  031 (all from roots) had acute activity against pseudomonas fluorescens, while azr027, 032, and 051 (also all from roots) showed activity against escherichia coli. meanwhile, an isolate of nocardia sp. from leaves (azl025) showed antagonism against bacillus subtilis. overall, 32 of the 55 were found to have broad spectrum significant antimicrobial activity, while about 4% of them showed  strong and acute inhibition to pathogenic fungi and bacteria. isolates of streptomyces azr031, 008, and 047, nocardia sp. azl025, and streptosporangium sp. azr 021 and 048 are of particular interest because they showed significant antagonistic activity against root pathogens, including pythium and phytophthora  sp. thus, many of the isolates recovered from a. indica in this study may be used in developing potential bio-control agents against a range of pathogenic fungi and bacteria and in the production of novel natural antimicrobial compounds. these results not only further our understanding of plant-microbe interactions but also indicate that there is an untapped resource of endophytic microorganisms that could be exploited in the biotechnological, medicinal, and agricultural industries.

TI  == diversity of root associated microorganisms of selected medicinal plants and influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antimicrobial property of coriandrum sativum.
AB  == the total heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were enumerated from the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of 50 selected locally available medicinal plants in and around bharathiar university. in all the plants, population of microorganism were higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the non rhizosphere soil. among the microorganisms, bacterial population was higher in number followed by fungus and actinomycetes. of the medicinal plants, the maximum rhizosphere effect was observed in annona squamosa and the minimum effect was seen in eclipta alba and cassia auriculata. among the bacteria the dominant species was bacillus followed by pseudomonas, enterobacter, corynebacterium, micrococcus and serratia. the streptomyces species was found to be dominant followed by deuteromycetes and frankia among the actinomycetes. among the fungal  isolates rhizopus was found to be higher in number followed by aspergillus, penicillium, mucor and fusarium. about 70.96% of the bacterial isolates were found to be nitrate reducers and 90.60% of the bacteria solubilised phosphate. the rhizosphere bacterial isolates were also capable of hydrolyzing starch, cellulose, casein, urea and gelatin. the isolates of bacteria, actinomycetes and  fungus were also able to produce phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (iaa). the maximum iaa production was recorded by fusarium sp (5.8 mg/l). the rhizosphere bacterial isolates showed resistance to 14 commercially used antibiotics. in an attempt to check the influence of these plant growth promoting microorganisms on  the antimicrobial property of coriandrum sativum against escherichia coli mtcc-443 and aeromonas hydrophila mtcc-646, the results observed was not encouraging since the inoculants did not influence the antibacterial property. however extensive and in depth study is required to find out the influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antibacterial property of medicinal plants. the other  results clearly indicated that the rhizosphere microorganisms could be exploited  for its innumerable properties and active metabolites.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (cgtase, ec 2.4.1.19) gene from bacillus sp.  g1 was successfully isolated and cloned into escherichia coli. analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of an open reading frame of 2,109 bp and encoded a 674 amino acid protein. purified cgtase exhibited a molecular weight of 75 kda and had optimum activity at ph 6 and 60 degrees c. heterologous  recombinant protein expression in e. coli is commonly problematic causing intracellular localization and formation of inactive inclusion bodies. this paper shows that the majority of cgtase was secreted into the medium due to the signal  peptide of bacillus sp. g1 that also works well in e. coli, leading to easier purification steps. when reacted with starch, cgtase g1 produced 90% beta-cyclodextrin (cd) and 10% gamma-cd. this enzyme also preferred the economical tapioca starch as a substrate, based on kinetics studies. therefore, cgtase g1 could potentially serve as an industrial enzyme for the production of beta-cd.

AB  == aims: to isolate, clone and express a novel phytase gene (phy) from bacillus sp.  in escherichia coli; to recover the active enzyme from inclusion bodies; and to characterize the recombinant phytase. methods and results: the molecular weight of phytase was estimated as 40 kda on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a requirement of ca(2+) ions was found essential both for refolding and activity of the enzyme. bacillus phytase exhibited a specific activity of 16 u mg(-1) protein; it also revealed broad ph and temperature ranges of 5.0 to 8.0 and 25 to 70 degrees c, respectively. the k(m) value of phytase for hydrolysis of sodium phytate has been determined as 0.392 mmol l(-1). the activity of enzyme has been  inhibited by edta. the enzyme exhibited ample thermostability upon exposure to high temperatures from 75 to 95 degrees c. after 9 h of cultivation of transformed e. coli in the bioreactor, the cell biomass reached 26.81 g wet weight (ww) per l accounting for 4289 u enzyme activity compared with 1.978 g ww  per l producing 256 u activity in shake-flask cultures. in silico analysis revealed a beta-propeller structure of phytase. conclusions: this is the first report of its kind on the purification and successful in vitro refolding of bacillus phytase from the inclusion bodies formed in the transformed e. coli. significance and impact of the study: efficient and reproducible protocols for cloning, expression, purification and in vitro refolding of bacillus phytase enzyme from the transformed e. coli have been developed. the novel phytase, with  broad ph and temperature range, renaturation ability and substrate specificity, appears promising as an ideal feed supplement. identification of site between 179th amino acid leucine and 180th amino acid asparagine offers scope for insertion of small peptides/domains for production of chimeric genes without altering enzyme activity.

TI  == biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates co-polymer in e. coli using genes from pseudomonas and bacillus.
AB  == expression of pseudomonas aeruginosa genes pha synthase1 (phac1) and (r)-specific enoyl coa hydratase1 (phaj1) under a lacz promoter was able to support production of a copolymer of polyhydroxybutyrate (phb) and medium chain length polyhydoxyalkanoates (mcl-pha) in escherichia coli. in order to improve the yield and quality of pha, plasmid bearing the above genes was introduced into e. coli jc7623, harboring integrated beta-ketothiolase (phaa) and nadph dependent-acetoacetyl coa reductase (phab) genes from a bacillus sp. also driven  by a lacz promoter. the recombinant e. coli (jc7623abc1j1) grown on various fatty acids along with glucose was found to produce 28-34% cellular dry weight of pha.  gas chromatography and (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the polymer confirmed the ability of the strain to produce phb-co-hydroxy valerate (hv)-co-mcl-pha copolymers. the ratio of short chain length (scl) to mcl-pha varied from 78:22 to 18:82. addition of acrylic acid, an inhibitor of beta-oxidation resulted in improved production (3-11% increase) of pha copolymer. the combined use of enzymes from bacillus sp. and pseudomonas sp. for the production of scl-co-mcl pha in e. coli is a novel approach and is being reported for the first time.

TI  == effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.

TI  == biosorption of nickel, chromium and zinc by merp-expressing recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli hosts able to over-express metal-binding proteins (merp) originating from gram-positive (bacillus cereus rc607) and gram-negative (pseudomonas sp. k-62) bacterial strains were used to adsorb ni(2+), zn(2+) and cr(3+) in aqueous solutions. the initial adsorption rate and adsorption capacity  were determined to evaluate the performance of the biosorbents. with the expression of merp protein, the metal adsorption capacity of the recombinant strains for ni(2+), zn(2+) and cr(3+) significantly improved. the cells carrying  gram-positive merp gene (gb) adsorbed zn(2+) and cr(3+) at a capacity of 22.3 and 0.98 mmol/g biomass, which is 121% and 72% higher, respectively, over that of the merp-free host cells. adsorption capacity of the cells carrying gram-negative merp gene (gp) also increased 144% and 126% for zn(2+) and cr(3+), respectively.  both recombinant strains also exhibited 24% and 5% enhancement in adsorption of ni(2+) for gb and gp, respectively. the initial adsorption rate of the recombinant biosorbents was also higher than that of the merp-free host, suggesting an increased metal-binding affinity with merp expression. severe cell  damage on gb biosorbent was observed after cr(3+) adsorption, probably due to the metal toxicity effect on the cells.

TI  == [flocculent genomic clone and flocculating mechanism analysis].
AB  == one strain, named as bacillus sp. f2, of which flocculent ability can reach 84%,  was separated. flocculent genomic library was constructed. the total genomic dna  of f2 was extracted. it was partly digested by restriction enzyme sau3ai and then was connected with carrier puc19dna which was totally digested by restriction enzyme bamhi and further was converted to competent cells jm109. these cells were smeared on the ampicillin substrate. after one night culture, we selected them by white-blue spot screening and constructed the flocculent genomic library. the library included 3.5 x 10(4) recons and the titre was 3.5 x 10(5) dpfu/ml. strain of escherichia coli. positive clone fc2, which could express flocculent activity, was acquired after selection. flocculent tests showed that the flocculent efficiency of fc2 was 90%, which was slightly higher than the original flocculent bacterium f2 and greatly higher than the competent cell jm109 (6.9%). it demonstrated that fc2's flocculent characteristic inherited from the original flocculent bacterium f2. by adopting the tapping mode afm and zeta-potential test, the flocculent microtopography of fc2, f2 and pure kaolin suspending solution was identified. the afm study revealed that, compared to the kaolin suspending solution with and without f2's fermented liquid, the kaolin suspending solution which has cloning bacterium fc2's fermented liquid had larger flocculent gel and more compact spherical structure, and the surface was rough with high degree concave and convex, and had large specific surface area and strong adsorption ability to the suspending particles in the solution. after adding the  fermented solution of cloning bacterium fc2 into kaolin suspending solution, the  amorphous and incompact flocculent particles transformed into spherical structure which was compact and had even horizontal dimension, which indicated that the agglutinin in fc2's fermented liquid could easily take kaolin suspending particles as its adsorption core and adsorbed on its surface and the flocculent efficiency was about 90%, which gave further confirmation to the great pollution  removal capability of fc2's fermented liquid. the results of zeta-potential test  illustrated that the intensity of electrovalent bond was different, resulting in  various flocculent morphology, which provided significant evidences for studying  flocculent mechanisms of biofloculant.

TI  == the x-ray structure of n-methyltryptophan oxidase reveals the structural determinants of substrate specificity.
AB  == the x-ray structure of monomeric n-methyltryptophan oxidase from escherichia coli (mtox) has been solved at 3.2 a resolution by molecular replacement methods using bacillus sp. sarcosine oxidase structure (msox, 43% sequence identity) as search  model. the analysis of the substrate binding site highlights the structural determinants that favour the accommodation of the bulky n-methyltryptophan residue in mtox. in fact, although the nature and geometry of the catalytic residues within the first contact shell of the fad moiety appear to be virtually  superposable in mtox and msox, the presence of a thr residue in position 239 in mtox (met245 in msox) located at the entrance of the active site appears to play  a key role for the recognition of the amino acid substrate side chain. accordingly, a 15 fold increase in k(cat) and 100 fold decrease in k(m) for sarcosine as substrate has been achieved in mtox upon t239m mutation, with a concomitant three-fold decrease in activity towards n-methyltryptophan. these data provide clear evidence for the presence of a catalytic core, common to the members of the methylaminoacid oxidase subfamily, and of a side chain recognition pocket, located at the entrance of the active site, that can be adjusted to host  diverse aminoacids in the different enzyme species. the site involved in the covalent attachment of flavin has also been addressed by screening degenerate mutants in the relevant positions around cys308-fad linkage. lys341 appears to be the key residue involved in flavin incorporation and covalent linkage.

TI  == expression and purification of bmri restriction endonuclease and its n-terminal cleavage domain variants.
AB  == bmri (actggg n5/n4) is one of the few metal-independent restriction endonucleases (reases) found in bacteria. the bmri restriction-modification system was cloned by the methylase selection method, inverse pcr, and pcr. bmri rease shows significant amino acid sequence identity to bfii and a putative endonuclease mspbncorf3798 from the sequenced mesorhizobium sp. bnc1 genome. the edta-resistant bmri rease was successfully over-expressed in a pre-modified e. coli strain from pet21a or pbac-expiq vectors. the recombinant bmri rease shows strong promiscuous activity (star activity) in neb buffers 1, 4, and an edta buffer. star activity was diminished in buffers with 100-150 mm nacl and 10 mm mgcl(2). his-tagged bmri192, the n-terminal cleavage domain of bmri, was expressed in e. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. the refolded bmri192 protein possesses non-specific endonuclease activity. bmri192 variants with a single ser to cys substitution (s76c or s90c) and bmri200 (t200c) with a single cys at the c-terminal end were also constructed and purified. bmri200 digests both single-strand (ss) and double-strand (ds) dna and the nuclease activity on ss dna is at least 5-fold higher than that on ds dna. the cys-containing bmri192  and bmri200 nuclease variants may be useful for coupling to other dna binding elements such as synthetic zinc fingers, thio-containing locked nucleic acids (lna) or peptide nucleic acids (pna).

TI  == an abrb-like protein might be involved in the regulation of cylindrospermopsin production by aphanizomenon ovalisporum.
AB  == certain filamentous cyanobacteria, including aphanizomenon ovalisporum, are potentially toxic owing to the formation of the hepatotoxin cylindrospermopsin. we previously identified a gene cluster in a. ovalisporum likely to be involved in cylindrospermopsin biosynthesis, including amidinotransferase (aoaa) and polyketide-synthase (aoac), transcribed on the reverse strands. analysis of the genomic region between aoaa and aoac identified two transcription start points for each of these genes, differentially expressed under nitrogen and light stress conditions. the transcript abundances of these genes and the cylindrospermopsin level were both affected by nitrogen availability and light intensity. gel shift  assays and dna affinity columns isolated a protein that specifically binds to a 150 bp dna fragment from the region between aoaa and aoac, and ms/ms analyses identified similarity to abrb in other cyanobacteria and in bacillus sp. comparison of the native abrb isolated from a. ovalisporum with that obtained after cloning and overexpression of abrb in escherichia coli identified specific  post-translational modifications in the native cyanobacterial protein. these modifications, which are missing in the protein expressed in e. coli, include n-acetylation and methylation of specific residues. we discuss the possible role  of these modifications in the regulation of cylindrospermopsin production in aphanizomenon.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the mode of action of bls p34, a bacteriocin-like substance (bls) produced by a novel bacillus sp. strain p34 isolated from the amazon basin. the effect of the bls was tested against listeria monocytogenes, showing a bactericidal effect at 200 au (activity units) ml(-1), while no inhibition of spore outgrowth of bacillus cereus was observed with a dose of 1,600 au ml(-1). growth of escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis was inhibited, but only when the chelating agent edta was co-added with the bls.  the effect of bls p34 on l. monocytogenes was also investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. treated cells showed an important frequency increase in 1,452 and 1,397 cm(-1) and decrease in 1,217 and 1,058 cm(-1), corresponding assignments of fatty acids and phospholipids. transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell envelope and loss of protoplasmic material. bls p34 was bactericidal to gram-positive, and also showed inhibitory effect against  gram-negative bacteria. there is evidence that its mode of action corresponds to  that of a membrane-active substance. the knowledge about the mode of action of this bls is essential to determine its effective application as an antimicrobial  agent.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == the structural basis for unidirectional rotation of thermoalkaliphilic f1-atpase.
AB  == the atp synthase of the thermoalkaliphilic bacillus sp. ta2.a1 operates exclusively in atp synthesis direction. in the crystal structure of the nucleotide-free alpha(3)beta(3)gamma epsilon subcomplex (ta2f(1)) at 3.1 a resolution, all three beta subunits adopt the open beta(e) conformation. the structure shows salt bridges between the helix-turn-helix motif of the c-terminal domain of the beta(e) subunit (residues asp372 and asp375) and the n-terminal helix of the gamma subunit (residues arg9 and arg10). these electrostatic forces  pull the gamma shaft out of the rotational center and impede rotation through steric interference with the beta(e) subunit. replacement of arg9 and arg10 with  glutamines eliminates the salt bridges and results in an activation of atp hydrolysis activity, suggesting that these salt bridges prevent the native enzyme from rotating in atp hydrolysis direction. a similar bending of the gamma shaft as in the ta2f(1) structure was observed by single-particle analysis of the ta2f(1)f(o) holoenzyme.

AB  == an actinomycete, designated strain gimv4.0001(t), was isolated from a forest soil sample in vietnam. it produced white aerial mycelium and violet-blue diffusible pigment on gause's synthetic agar. the substrate mycelium colour was not sensitive to ph. micoscopic observations revealed that strain gimv4.0001(t) produced long, straight chains of cylindrical spores, and chemotaxonomic data confirmed that it belongs to the genus streptomyces. melanin was produced, but no antibacterial activity was evident against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans or penicillium citrinum. analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain gimv4.0001(t) revealed that the highest similarity (99.4 %) was to streptomyces bikiniensis atcc 11062(t). however, the dna-dna relatedness between strain gimv4.0001(t) and s. bikiniensis atcc 11062(t) was found to be 50.3 %. strain gimv4.0001(t) could also be differentiated from s. bikiniensis atcc 11062(t) and other streptomyces species showing high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (98-99 %) based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. on the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, it is evident that strain gimv4.0001(t) represents a novel species of the genus streptomyces, for which the name streptomyces vietnamensis sp. nov. is  proposed. the type strain is gimv4.0001(t) (=cctcc m 205143(t)=iam 15340(t)).

TI  == walnut (juglans regia l.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  == different cultivars of walnut (juglans regia l.) leaves (cv. lara, franquette, mayette, marbot, mellanaise and parisienne) grown in portugal, were investigated  in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase hplc/dad and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. the antimicrobial capacity was screened against gram positive (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative  bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans). walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of gram positive bacteria, being b. cereus the most susceptible one (mic 0.1mg/ml). gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/ml. lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of staphylococcus sp. antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on dpph  (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. in a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (ec(50) values lower than 1mg/ml), being cv. lara the most effective one.

TI  == desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of intact bacteria.
AB  == desorption electrospray ionization (desi) mass spectrometry (ms) was used to differentiate seven bacteria species on the basis of their measured desi-mass spectral profile. both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were tested and included escherichia coli, staphyloccocus aureus, enterococcus sp., bordetella bronchiseptica, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhimurium. distinct desi-mass spectra, in the mass range of 50-500 u, were obtained from whole bacteria in either positive or negative ion modes in less than 2 mins analysis time. positive ion desi-mass spectral fingerprints were compared using principal components analysis (pca) to investigate reproducibility for the intraday and the day-to-day measurements and the method selectivity to differentiate the bacteria studied. detailed study of variances in the assay revealed that a large contribution to the desi-mass spectral fingerprint variation was the growth media preparation procedure. specifically, experiments conducted with the growth media prepared using the same batch yielded highly reproducible desi-mass spectra, both in intraday and in day-to-day analyses (i.e. one batch of growth media used over a 3-day period versus a new batch every day over the same 3-day period). conclusions are drawn from our findings in terms of  strategies for rapid biodetection with desi-ms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in the common seawhip, leptogorgia virgulata (cnidaria: gorgonaceae).
AB  == antimicrobial activity was examined in the gorgonian leptogorgia virgulata (common seawhip) from south carolina waters. extraction and assay protocols were  developed to identify antimicrobial activity in crude extracts of l. virgulata. detection was determined by liquid growth inhibition assays using escherichia coli bl21, vibrio harveyii, micrococcus luteus, and a bacillus sp. isolate. this  represents the first report of antimicrobial activity in l. virgulata, a temperate/sub-tropical coral of the western atlantic ocean. results from growth inhibition assays guided a fractionation scheme to identify active compounds. reverse-phase hplc, hplc-mass spectrometry, and 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy were  used to isolate, purify, and characterize metabolites in antimicrobial fractions  of l. virgulata. corroborative hplc-ms/nmr evidence validated the presence of homarine and a homarine analog, well-known emetic metabolites previously isolated from l. virgulata, in coral extracts. in subsequent assays, partially-purified l. virgulata fractions collected from hplc-ms fractionation were shown to contain antimicrobial activity using m. luteus and v. harveyii. this study provides evidence that homarine is an active constituent of the innate immune system in l. virgulata. we speculate it may act synergistically with cofactors and/or congeners in this octocoral to mount a response to microbial invasion and disease.

TI  == alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain ksm-ld1 contains a record number of subtilisin-like serine proteases genes.
AB  == the presence of 11 genes encoding subtilisin-like serine proteases was demonstrated by cloning from the genome of alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain ksm-ld1. this strain exoproduces the oxidatively stable alkaline protease ld-1 (saeki et al. curr microbiol, 47:337-340, 2003). among the 11 genes, six genes encoding alkaline proteases (sa, sb, sc, sd, se, and ld-1) were expressed in bacillus hosts. however, the other five genes for subtilisin-like proteases (sf,  sg, sh, si, and sj) were expressed in neither bacillus hosts nor escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequences of sa, sb, sc, sf, sg, sh, si, and sj showed similarity to those of other subtilisin-like proteases from bacillus strains with only 38 to 86% identity. the deduced amino acid sequence of sd was completely identical to that of an oxidatively stable alkaline protease from bacillus sp. strain sd521, and that of se was almost identical to that of a high-molecular mass subtilisin from bacillus sp. strain d-6 with 99.7% identity.  there are four to nine subtilisin-like serine protease genes in the reported genomes of bacillus strains. at least 11 genes for the enzymes present in the genome of bacillus sp. strain ksm-ld1, and this is the greatest number identified to date.

AB  == the gene coding for an azoreductase, designated as an azra, was cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification from the genomic dna of bacillus sp. strain b29 isolated from soil. the azra encoded a protein of 208 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 22,766 da. the enzyme was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli with a strong band of 23 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified recombinant azra was a homodimer with a native molecular mass of 48 kda containing two molecules of flavin mononucleotide (fmn; oxidized). this activity was oxygen insensitive and was nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form; nadh) dependent. recombinant azra exhibited a broad ph stability between 6 and 10 with a temperature optimum of 60-80 degrees c. the enzyme cleaved the model azo compound of methyl red [mr,  4'-(dimethylamino)-azobenzene-2-carboxylic acid] into 2-aminobenzoic acid and n,  n'-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine by ping-pong mechanism. the enzyme was not only able to decolorize mr but also able to decolorize sulfonated azo dyes such as orange i and acid red 88.

TI  == a new monocupin quercetinase of streptomyces sp. fla: identification and heterologous expression of the qued gene and activity of the recombinant enzyme towards different flavonols.
AB  == the gene qued encoding quercetinase of streptomyces sp. fla, a soil isolate related to s. eurythermus (t), was identified. quercetinases catalyze the 2,4-dioxygenolytic cleavage of 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone to 2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinol carboxylic acid and carbon monoxide. the qued gene was expressed in s. lividans and e. coli, and the recombinant hexahistidine-tagged protein (quedhis(6)) was purified. several flavonols were converted by quedhis(6), whereas co formation from the 2,3-dihydroflavonol taxifolin and the flavone luteolin were not observed. in contrast to bicupin quercetinases from aspergillus japonicus and bacillus subtilis, and bicupin pirins showing quercetinase activity, qued of strain fla is a monocupin exhibiting 35.9% sequence identity to the c-terminal domain of b. subtilis quercetinase. its native molecular mass of 63 kda suggests a multimeric protein.  a qued-specific probe hybridized with fragments of genomic dna of four other quercetin degrading streptomyces strains, but not with dna of b. subtilis. potential orfs upstream of qued probably code for a serine protease and an endoribonuclease; two orfs downstream of qued may encode an amidohydrolase and a  carboxylesterase. this arrangement suggests that qued is not part of a catabolic  gene cluster. quercetinases might play a major role as detoxifying rather than catabolic enzymes.

AB  == a novel gene (ba-ega) of bacillus sp. ac-1, encoding an endoglucanase (ba-ega), was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. ba-ega, containing a 1,980-bp open  reading frame (orf), encoded a protein of 659 amino acids and had a molecular mass of 74.87 kda. ba-ega was a modular enzyme composed of a family-9 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic module (cm9) and a family-3 carbohydrate-binding module (cbm3). to investigate the functions of the cbm3 and cm9, a number of truncated derivatives of ba-ega were constructed, and all were active. the catalytic module (rcm9) alone was less stable at high temperature than the recombinant ba-ega (rba-ega). the temperature stability for the complex of rcm9 and rcbm3 was still  lower than rba-ega, but higher than rcm9 alone. these observations indicated the  existence of a non-covalent interaction between cm9 and cbm3 that might strengthen the stability of cm9. however, this interaction is not strong enough to mimic the protective effect of the cbm in the wild-type enzyme.

TI  == a specific adaptation in the a subunit of thermoalkaliphilic f1fo-atp synthase enables atp synthesis at high ph but not at neutral ph values.
AB  == analysis of the atp operon from the thermoalkaliphilic bacillus sp. ta2.a1 and comparison with other atp operons from alkaliphilic bacteria reveals the presence of a conserved lysine residue at position 180 (bacillus sp. ta2.a1 numbering) within the a subunit of these f(1)f(o)-atp synthases. we hypothesize that the basic nature of this residue is ideally suited to capture protons from the bulk phase at high ph. to test this hypothesis, a heterologous expression system for the atp synthase from bacillus sp. ta2.a1 (ta2f(1)f(o)) was developed in escherichia coli dk8 (deltaatp). amino acid substitutions were made in the a subunit of ta2f(1)f(o) at position 180. lysine (ak180) was substituted for the basic residues histidine (ak180h) or arginine (ak180r), and the uncharged residue glycine (ak180g). atp synthesis experiments were performed in adp plus p(i)-loaded right-side-out membrane vesicles energized by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. when these enzyme complexes were examined for their ability to perform atp synthesis over the ph range from 7.0 to 10.0, ta2f(1)f(o) and ak180r  showed a similar ph profile having optimum atp synthesis rates at ph 9.0-9.5 with no measurable atp synthesis at ph 7.5. conversely, ak180h and ak180g showed maximal atp synthesis at ph values 8.0 and 7.5, respectively. atp synthesis under these conditions for all enzyme forms was sensitive to dccd. these data strongly  imply that amino acid residue lys(180) is a specific adaptation within the a subunit of ta2f(1)f(o) to facilitate proton capture at high ph. at ph values near the pk(a) of lys(180), the trapped protons readily dissociate to reach the subunit c binding sites, but this dissociation is impeded at neutral ph values causing either a blocking of the proposed h(+) channel and/or mechanism of proton translocation, and hence atp synthesis is inhibited.

TI  == involvement of cytoplasmic membrane damage in the copper (ii)-dependent cytotoxicity of a novel naturally occurring tripyrrole.
AB  == in the presence of a nonlethal concentration of cu(ii), washed escherichia coli atcc8739 cells were killed by a novel tripyrrole 1, isolated as a red pigment from the serratia sp. cell killing was accompanied by a depletion in the potassium pools of the cells due to the damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, without any detectable dna damage as revealed by the transformed plasmid dna and  phage induction assay. this revealed that the bactericidal activity of compound 1 in the presence of cu(ii) results from membrane damage. induction of endogenous catalase in the e. coli cells increased their resistance against the combination  of compound 1 and cu(ii). although compound 1 alone generated large amount of reactive oxygen species (ros), it did not show any cell killing against e. coli in the absence of cu(ii). the cu(ii)-dependent bactericidal activity of compound  1 was suppressed by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, bathocuproine, catalase and superoxide disumutase (sod), but not by dimethyl sulfoxide. these findings suggest that recycling redox reactions between cu(ii) and cu(i), involving compound 1 and hydrogen peroxide on the cell surface, must be important in the mechanism of the killing. compound 1 alone showed selective bactericidal activity against the gram positive bacterium, bacillus cereus atcc 6630, possibly due to its differential cellular transport.

TI  == cloning, purification, and characterization of chitinase from bacillus sp. dau101.
AB  == a chitinase encoding gene from bacillus sp. dau101 was cloned in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequencing revealed a single open reading frame containing 1781 bp and encoding 597 amino acids with 66 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram. the chitinase was composed of three domains: a catalytic domain, a fibronectin iii domain, and a chitin binding domain. the chitinase was purified by gst-fusion purification system. the ph and temperature optima of the enzyme were 7.5 and 60 degrees c, respectively. the metal ions, zn(2+), cu(2+), and hg(2+), were strongly inhibited chitinase activity. however, chitinase activity was increased 1.4-fold by co(2+). chisb could hydrolyze glcnac(2) to n-acetylglucosamine and was produced glcnac(2), when chitin derivatives were used as the substrate. this indicated that chisb was a bifunctional enzyme, n-acetylglucosaminase and chitobiosidase. the enzyme could not hydrolyze glycol chitin, glycol chitosan, or cmc, but hydrolyzed colloidal chitin and soluble chitosan.

TI  == a novel highly boron tolerant bacterium, bacillus boroniphilus sp. nov., isolated from soil, that requires boron for its growth.
AB  == three strains of gram-positive, motile, rod-shaped and boron (b)-tolerant bacterium were isolated from naturally b containing soil of hisarcik area in the  kutahya province, turkey. the strains, designated as t-14a, t-15z(t) and t-17s, produced spherical or ellipsoidal endospores in a terminal bulging sporangium. the strains required b for the growth and can tolerate more than 450 mm b. these  also tolerated up to 7.0% (w/v) nacl in the presence of 50 mm b in agar medium but grew optimally without nacl. the temperature range for growth was 16-37 degrees c (optimal of 30 degrees c), whereas the ph range was 6.5-9.0 (optimal of 7.5-8.5). the dna g + c content was 41.1-42.2 mol% and the predominant cellular fatty acid was iso-c(15:0). the major respiratory quinone system was detected as  mk-7 and the diamino acid of the peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid. based on phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis of  16s rrna gene sequences data and dna-dna re-association values, we concluded that the three strains belong to a novel species of the genus bacillus, the type strain of which is t-15z(t) and for which we proposed the name, b. boroniphilus sp. nov. (dsm 17376(t) = iam 15287(t) = atcc baa-1204(t)).

TI  == conformational and functional studies of gomesin analogues by cd, epr and fluorescence spectroscopies.
AB  == the aim of this work was to examine the bioactivity and the conformational behavior of some gomesin (gm) analogues in different environments that mimic the  biological membrane/water interface. thus, manual peptide synthesis was performed by the solid-phase method, antimicrobial activity was evaluated by a liquid growth inhibition assay, and conformational studies were performed making use of  several spectroscopic techniques: cd, fluorescence and epr. [toac(1)]-gm; [toac(1), ser(2,6,11,15)]-gm; [trp(7)]-gm; [ser(2,6,11,15), trp(7)]-gm; [trp(9)]-gm; and [ser(2,6,11,15), trp(9)]-gm were synthesized and tested. the results indicated that incorporation of toac or trp caused no significant reduction of antimicrobial activity; the cyclic analogues presented a beta-hairpin conformation similar to that of gm. all analogues interacted with negatively charged sds both above and below the detergent's critical micellar concentration (cmc). in contrast, while gm and [toac(1)]-gm required higher lpc concentrations to bind to micelles of this zwitterionic detergent, the cyclic trp derivatives and the linear derivatives did not seem to interact with this membrane-mimetic system. these data corroborate previous results that suggest that electrostatic interactions with the lipid bilayer of microorganisms play an  important role in the mechanism of action of gomesin. moreover, the results show  that hydrophobic interactions also contribute to membrane binding of this antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == midgut bacteria required for bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal activity.
AB  == bacillus thuringiensis is the most widely applied biological insecticide and is used to manage insects that affect forestry and agriculture and transmit human and animal pathogens. this ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium kills insect larvae largely through the action of insecticidal crystal proteins and is commonly deployed as a direct bacterial spray. moreover, plants engineered with the cry genes encoding the b. thuringiensis crystal proteins are the most widely cultivated transgenic crops. for decades, the mechanism of insect killing has been assumed to be toxin-mediated lysis of the gut epithelial cells, which leads  to starvation, or b. thuringiensis septicemia. here, we report that b. thuringiensis does not kill larvae of the gypsy moth in the absence of indigenous midgut bacteria. elimination of the gut microbial community by oral administration of antibiotics abolished b. thuringiensis insecticidal activity, and reestablishment of an enterobacter sp. that normally resides in the midgut microbial community restored b. thuringiensis-mediated killing. escherichia coli  engineered to produce the b. thuringiensis insecticidal toxin killed gypsy moth larvae irrespective of the presence of other bacteria in the midgut. however, when the engineered e. coli was heat-killed and then fed to the larvae, the larvae did not die in the absence of the indigenous midgut bacteria. e. coli and  the enterobacter sp. achieved high populations in hemolymph, in contrast to b. thuringiensis, which appeared to die in hemolymph. our results demonstrate that b. thuringiensis-induced mortality depends on enteric bacteria.

TI  == oxidative destabilization of dissolved organics and e. coli in domestic wastewater through immobilized cell reactor system.
AB  == domestic wastewater contains a considerable amount of pathogenic organisms besides non-biodegradable organics. the conventional technologies followed for the treatment of domestic wastewater are less efficient in removing pathogenic organisms despite substantial removal of dissolved organics. the focal theme of the present investigation was to use a chemo-autotrophic activated carbon oxidation (caaco) system, an immobilized cell reactor using chemoautotrophs (bacillus sp.) for the treatment of domestic wastewater. the oxidation of organics and escherichia coli in wastewater is controlled by the parameters space time, o(2)/cod, bed height and cod loading. the scheme comprised of anaerobic treatment, sand filtration and caaco treatment removed bod. cod, total organic carbon (toc), dissolved protein, total kjeldhal nitrogen (tkn) and bacterial count (most probable number (mpn)) by 81%, 92%, 84%, 94%, 93% and 99.9997%, respectively. the low concentration of e. coli in the caaco-treated wastewater was completely eliminated through uv irradiation in 3 min at 254 nm.

TI  == systematic screening of all signal peptides from bacillus subtilis: a powerful strategy in optimizing heterologous protein secretion in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == efficient protein secretion is very important in biotechnology as it provides active and stable enzymes, which are an essential prerequisite for successful biocatalysis. therefore, optimizing enzyme-producing bacterial strains is a major challenge in the field of biotechnology and protein production. in this study, the gram-positive model bacterium bacillus subtilis was optimized for heterologous protein secretion using a novel approach. two lipolytic enzymes, cutinase from fusarium solani pisi and a cytoplasmatic esterase of metagenomic origin, were chosen as reporters for heterologous protein secretion. in a systematic screening approach, all naturally occurring (non-lipoprotein) sec-type signal peptides (sps) from b. subtilis were characterized for their potential in  heterologous protein secretion. surprisingly, optimal sps in cutinase secretion were inefficient in esterase secretion and vice versa, indicating the importance  of an optimal fit between the sp and the respective mature part of the desired secretion target proteins. these results highlight the need for individually optimal signal peptides for every heterologous secretion target. therefore, the sp library generated in this study represents a powerful tool for secretion optimization in gram-positive expression hosts.

TI  == characterization of an active spore photoproduct lyase, a dna repair enzyme in the radical s-adenosylmethionine superfamily.
AB  == the major photoproduct in uv-irradiated bacillus spore dna is a unique thymine dimer called spore photoproduct (sp, 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine). the enzyme spore photoproduct lyase (sp lyase) has been found to catalyze the repair of sp dimers to thymine monomers in a reaction that requires s-adenosylmethionine. we present here the first detailed characterization of catalytically active sp lyase, which has been anaerobically purified from overexpressing escherichia coli. anaerobically purified sp lyase is monomeric and is red-brown in color. the purified enzyme contains approximately 3.1 iron and 3.0 acid-labile s(2-) per protein and has a uv-visible spectrum characteristic of iron-sulfur proteins (410 nm (11.9 mm(-1) cm(-1)) and 450 nm (10.5 mm(-1) cm(-1))). the x-band epr spectrum of the purified enzyme shows a nearly isotropic signal (g = 2.02) characteristic  of a [3fe-4s]1+ cluster; reduction of sp lyase with dithionite results in the appearance of a new epr signal (g = 2.03, 1.93, and 1.89) with temperature dependence and g values consistent with its assignment to a [4fe-4s]1+ cluster. the reduced purified enzyme is active in sp repair, with a specific activity of 0.33 micromol/min/mg. only a catalytic amount of s-adenosylmethionine is required for dna repair, and no irreversible cleavage of s-adenosylmethionine into methionine and 5'-deoxyadenosine is observed during the reaction. label transfer  from [5'-3h]s-adenosylmethionine to repaired thymine is observed, providing evidence to support a mechanism in which a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate  directly abstracts a hydrogen from sp c-6 to generate a substrate radical, and subsequent to radical-mediated beta-scission, a product thymine radical abstracts a hydrogen from 5'-deoxyadenosine to regenerate the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. together, our results support a mechanism in which s-adenosylmethionine acts as a catalytic cofactor, not a substrate, in the dna repair reaction.

TI  == amino acid cost and codon-usage biases in 6 prokaryotic genomes: a whole-genome analysis.
AB  == for most prokaryotic organisms, amino acid biosynthesis represents a significant  portion of their overall energy budget. the difference in the cost of synthesis between amino acids can be striking, differing by as much as 7-fold. two prokaryotic organisms, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, have been shown to preferentially utilize less costly amino acids in highly expressed genes, indicating that parsimony in amino acid selection may confer a selective advantage for prokaryotes. this study confirms those findings and extends them to 4 additional prokaryotic organisms: chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydophila pneumoniae ar39, synechocystis sp. pcc 6803, and thermus thermophilus hb27. adherence to codon-usage biases for each of these 6 organisms is inversely correlated with a coding region's average amino acid biosynthetic cost in a fashion that is independent of chemoheterotrophic, photoautotrophic, or thermophilic lifestyle. the obligate parasites c. trachomatis and c. pneumoniae ar39 are incapable of synthesizing many of the 20 common amino acids. removing auxotrophic amino acids from consideration in these organisms does not alter the  overall trend of preferential use of energetically inexpensive amino acids in highly expressed genes.

TI  == inhibition of atp hydrolysis by thermoalkaliphilic f1fo-atp synthase is controlled by the c terminus of the epsilon subunit.
AB  == the f(1)f(o)-atp synthases of alkaliphilic bacteria exhibit latent atpase activity, and for the thermoalkaliphile bacillus sp. strain ta2.a1, this activity is intrinsic to the f(1) moiety. to study the mechanism of atpase inhibition, we  developed a heterologous expression system in escherichia coli to produce ta2f(1) complexes from this thermoalkaliphile. like the native f(1)f(o)-atp synthase, the recombinant ta2f(1) was blocked in atp hydrolysis activity, and this activity was stimulated by the detergent lauryldimethylamine oxide. to determine if the c-terminal domain of the epsilon subunit acts as an inhibitor of atpase activity  and if an electrostatic interaction plays a role, a ta2f(1) mutant with either a  truncated epsilon subunit [i.e., ta2f(1)(epsilon(deltac))] or substitution of basic residues in the second alpha-helix of epsilon with nonpolar alanines [i.e., ta2f(1)(epsilon(6a))] was constructed. both mutants showed atp hydrolysis activity at low and high concentrations of atp. treatment of the purified f(1)f(o)-atp synthase and ta2f(1)(epsilon(wt)) complex with proteases revealed that the epsilon subunit was resistant to proteolytic digestion. in contrast, the epsilon subunit of ta2f(1)(epsilon(6a)) was completely degraded by trypsin, indicating that the c-terminal arm was in a conformation where it was no longer protected from proteolytic digestion. in addition, atpase activity was not further activated by protease treatment when compared to the untreated control, supporting the observation that epsilon was responsible for inhibition of atpase  activity. to study the effect of the alanine substitutions in the epsilon subunit in the entire holoenzyme, we reconstituted recombinant ta2f(1) complexes with f(1)-stripped native membranes of strain ta2.a1. the reconstituted ta2f(o)f(1)(epsilon(wt)) was blocked in atp hydrolysis and exhibited low levels of atp-driven proton pumping consistent with the f(1)f(o)-atp synthase in native  membranes. reconstituted ta2f(o)f(1)(epsilon(6a)) exhibited atpase activity that  correlated with increased atp-driven proton pumping, confirming that the epsilon  subunit also inhibits atpase activity of ta2f(o)f(1).

TI  == construction and characterization of nisin-controlled expression vectors for use  in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the nisin-controlled gene expression (nice) system, which was discovered in lactococcus lactis, was adapted to lactobacillus reuteri by ligating nisa promoter (pnisa) and nisrk dna fragments into the escherichia coli-lb. reuteri shuttle vector pste32. this chimerical plasmid (pnice) was capable of expressing  the heterologous amylase gene (amyl) under nisin induction. optimization of induction factors for this lb. reuteri/pnice system, including nisin concentration (viz. 50 ng/ml), growth phase of culture at which nisin be added (viz. at the early exponential phase), and the best time for analyzing the gene product after inoculation (viz. at the 3rd h), allowed the amylase product to be  expressed in high amounts, constituting up to about 18% of the total intracellular protein. furthermore, the signal peptide (sp) of amyl gene (spamyl) from bacillus licheniformis was ligated to the downstream of pnisa in pnice, upgrading this vector to a nice-secretion (nies) level, which was then designated pnies (sec+, secretion positive). characterization of pnies using an amyl-spdelta gene (amyl gene lacking its sp) as a reporter revealed the 3rd h after induction  as the secretion peak of this system, at which the secretion efficiency and the amount of alpha-amylase being secreted into the culture supernatant were estimated to reach 77.6% and 27.75 mg/l. expression and secretion of amyl products by pnies in lb. reuteri was also confirmed by sds-page and immunoblotting analysis.

TI  == structural analysis of n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase apoenzyme from escherichia coli.
AB  == we report the crystal structure of the apoenzyme of n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac6p) deacetylase from escherichia coli (ecnagpase) and the spectrometric evidence of the presence of zn2+ in the native  protein. the glcnac6p deacetylase is an enzyme of the amino sugar catabolic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of the glcnac6p into glucosamine 6-phosphate (glcn6p). the crystal structure was phased by the single isomorphous  replacement with anomalous scattering (siras) method using low-resolution (2.9 a) iodine anomalous scattering and it was refined against a native dataset up to 2.0 a resolution. the structure is similar to two other nagpases whose structures are known from thermotoga maritima (tmnagpase) and bacillus subtilis (bsnagpase); however, it shows a phosphate ion bound at the metal-binding site. compared to these previous structures, the apoenzyme shows extensive conformational changes in two loops adjacent to the active site. the e. coli enzyme is a tetramer and its dimer-dimer interface was analyzed. the tetrameric structure was confirmed in solution by small-angle x-ray scattering data. although no metal ions were detected in the present structure, experiments of photon-induced x-ray emission (pixe) spectra and of inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (icp-aes)  with enzyme that was neither exposed to chelating agents nor metal ions during purification, revealed the presence of 1.4 atoms of zn per polypeptide chain. enzyme inactivation by metal-sequestering agents and subsequent reactivation by the addition of several divalent cations, demonstrate the role of metal ions in ecnagpase structure and catalysis.

TI  == bph genes of the thermophilic pcb degrader, bacillus sp. jf8: characterization of the divergent ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase and hydrolase genes upstream of the  mn-dependent bphc.
AB  == bacillus sp. jf8 is a thermophilic polychlorinated biphenyl (pcb) degrader, which utilizes biphenyl and naphthalene. a thermostable, mn-dependent 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase, bphc_jf8, has been characterized previously. upstream of bphc are five orfs exhibiting low homology with, and a different gene order from, previously characterized bph genes. from the 5' to 3'  direction the genes are: a putative regulatory gene (bphr), a hydrolase (bphd), the large and small subunits of a ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (bpha1a2), and a cis-diol dehydrogenase (bphb). hybridization studies indicate that the genes are  located on a plasmid. ring-hydroxylating activity of recombinant bpha1a2_jf8 towards biphenyl, pcb, naphthalene and benzene was observed in escherichia coli cells, with complementation of non-specific ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase by host cell proteins. pcb degradation by recombinant bpha1a2_jf8 showed that the congener specificity of the recombinant enzyme was similar to bacillus sp. jf8. bphd_jf8, with an optimum temperature of 85 degrees c, exhibited a narrow substrate preference for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid. the arrhenius plot of bphd_jf8 was biphasic, with two characteristic energies of activation and a break point at 47 degrees c.

TI  == quick selection of a chimeric t2 phage that displays active enzyme on the viral capsid.
AB  == we designed a bacteriophage t2 system to display proteins fused at the n-terminus of the head protein small outer capsid (soc) of a t2 phage. to facilitate selection of chimeric phage, a t2 phage encoding the beta-galactosidase gene (betagal) upstream of the soc gene was constructed. the phage, named t2betagal, produces blue plaques on agar plates containing xgal. subsequently, a plasmid encoding the target protein upstream of soc was constructed and used to transform e. coli b(e) cells. transformed cells were infected with t2betagal and homologous recombination between phage dna and the plasmid resulted in a chimeric phage that produced transparent plaques due to the excision of the betagal gene. chitosanase of bacillus sp. strain k17 (chok), consisting of 453 amino acids, was used as a model target protein. recombinant t2 phage that produced chok was named t2chok. t2chok was produced from t2betagal at a recombination frequency of about 0.1%. on the other hand, the value for t2betagal produced from wild-type t2 was 0.001 %. this new system enables us to select recombinant phage very quickly and accurately. the number of molecules of chok was calculated at 14.7 per single phage. latent period and burst size were estimated for the chimeric phages.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of kojibiose phosphorylase gene from thermoanaerobacter brockii atcc35047.
AB  == a gene encoding kojibiose phosphorylase was cloned from thermoanaerobacter brockii atcc35047. the kojp gene encodes a polypeptide of 775 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence was homologous to those of trehalose phosphorylase from t. brockii and maltose phosphorylases from bacillus sp. and lactobacillus brevis with 35%, 29% and 28% identities, respectively. kojibiose phosphorylase was efficiently overexpressed in escherichia coli jm109. the dna sequence of 3956 bp analyzed in this study contains three open reading frames (orfs) downstream of kojp. the four orfs, kojp, koje, kojf, and kojg, form a gene cluster. the amino acid sequences deduced from koje and kojf are similar to those of the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of a sugar-binding periplasmic protein from thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis mb4. furthermore, the amino acid sequence deduced from kojg is similar to that of a permease of the abc-type sugar transport systems from t. tengcongensis mb4. each of three amino acid substitutions, d362n, k614q and e642q, caused a complete loss of kojibiose phosphorylase activity. these results suggest that d362, k614 and e642 play an important role in catalysis. another mutation, d459n, increased k(m) values for kojibiose (7-fold that for the wild type), beta-g1p (11-fold) and glucose (7-fold), whereas k(m) for inorganic phosphate was minimally affected by this mutation, suggesting that d459 may be involved in the binding to saccharides.

AB  == a polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) biosynthesis gene locus from bacillus sp. int005 strain, which had been isolated from a gas field, was cloned and analyzed at the  molecular level. we found that a 3.8-kbp drai-digested fragment of genomic dna of bacillus sp. int005 conferred pha-producing ability to escherichia coli, which was pha-negative. the dna fragment contained three genes, phar, -b and -c. the activity of 3-ketoacyl-coa reductase with nadph was detected in the lysate from recombinant e. coli carrying the phab gene. although pha synthase activity could  be detected in the extract from e. coli carrying phar, -b and -c genes, no such activity could be detected in that from e. coli carrying only the phac gene. however, the mixture of the crude extracts of e. coli expressing phar or phac revealed very high pha synthase activity. furthermore, when his-tagged phac was purified by ni-affinity chromatography from the mixture of crude extracts containing his-tagged phac or native phar, the eluate contained his-tagged phac and native phar. on the other hand, phar did not bind to the column directly. this purified phac with phar had 160-fold higher specific activity of pha synthase than that without phar. in addition, the kinetics of the purified phac with phar revealed a lag phase that preceded the linear phase. it has been known  that class iii pha synthase is composed of two different subunits, phac and phae, and phac and phae genes are directly linked in the genomes. furthermore, the pha  synthase has no lag phase. we hence concluded that the pha synthase of bacillus sp. int005 consists of phac and phar, and has characteristics different from class iii pha synthase.

TI  == efficient constitutive expression of bacillus subtilis xylanase a in escherichia  coli dh5alpha under the control of the bacillus bsxa promoter.
AB  == xylanase a (xyna) is a class g/11 xylanase secreted by bacillus subtilis. xyna was purified to homogeneity from b. subtilis strain 168 culture supernatants by ethanol precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. the dna fragment encoding the xyna together with the bsxa promoter region was amplified by pcr from b. subtilis 168 genomic dna, and cloned into the plasmid pt7t3 to give the plasmid pt7bsxa. after transformation of escherichia coli dh5alpha with pt7bsxa,  a 19-fold increase in the levels of the secreted xyna was detected in the supernatant as compared with the b. subtilis culture. correct post-translation modification of the recombinant protein was confirmed by n-terminal amino acid sequencing and ms analyses. the ph- and temperature-dependences of the native and recombinant proteins were identical, indicating that the pt7bsxa may be useful for the constitutive expression of heterologous protein in e. coli.

TI  == [construction of a secreting prokaryotic shuttle expressing plasmid pbcg-sp-hsp65 and its expression in mycobacterial smegmatis].
AB  == to construct the secretive prokaryotic shuttle expression plasmid pbcg-sp-hsp65,  the signal peptide sequence of antigen 85b amplified from bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) genome by pcr and the whole hsp65 dna sequence of human m.  tuberculosis obtained from the plasmid pcmv-mthsp65 by pcr were cloned into the plasmid pbcg-2100 under the control of the promoter of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) from human m. tuberculosis. recombinants were electroporated into mycobacterial smegmatis and induced by heating. results of the induced expression were detected by sds-page and the biological activity of the expressed protein was tested by western-blot analysis. results showed pbcg-sp-mthsp65 was constructed successfully and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis, pcr  detection and dna sequencing analysis. after it was electroporated into mycobacterial smegmatis and induced by heating, the percentage of expressed 65kd  protein in mycobacterial smegmatis detected by sds-page was 20% in total bacterial protein. but the percentage of expressed 65kd protein in recombibinant  mycobacterial smegmatis was up to 34.46% in total bacterial protein and 68.56% in the total protein of cell lysate supernants, which demonstrated the recombinant hsp65 gene could express in recombinant with high efficiency and the expressed proteins were mainly soluble. western-blot showed that the secretive proteins could specially combine with antibody against human m. tuberculosis hsp65. orally, pbcg-sp-hsp65 was successfully constructed; hsp65 gene could express in mycobacterial smegmatis with high efficiency via it. and the expressed proteins possess the biological activity. so it provids experimental evidence for the application of the recombinant mycobacterial smegmatis and the development of the vaccine against tuberculosis.

TI  == the crystal structure of mlc, a global regulator of sugar metabolism in escherichia coli.
AB  == mlc from escherichia coli is a transcriptional repressor controlling the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of the phosphotransferase system (pts), including ptsg and manxyz, the specific enzyme ii for glucose and mannose  pts transporters. in addition, mlc controls the transcription of malt, the gene of the global activator of the mal regulon. the inactivation of mlc as a repressor is mediated by binding to an actively transporting ptsg (eiicb(glc)). here we report the crystal structure of mlc at 2.7 a resolution representing the  first described structure of an rok (repressors, open reading frames, and kinases) family protein. mlc forms stable dimers thus explaining its binding affinity to palindromic operator sites. the n-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of mlc is stabilized by the amphipathic c-terminal helix implicated earlier in eiicb(glc) binding. furthermore, the structure revealed a metal-binding site within the cysteine-rich rok consensus motif that coordinates a structurally important zinc ion. a strongly reduced repressor activity was observed when two of the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues were exchanged against serine or alanine, demonstrating the role of zinc in mlc-mediated repressor function. the structures of a putative fructokinase from bacillus subtilis, the glucokinase from escherichia coli, and a glucomannokinase from arthrobacter sp. showed high structural homology to the rok family part of mlc.

TI  == bzdr, a repressor that controls the anaerobic catabolism of benzoate in azoarcus  sp. cib, is the first member of a new subfamily of transcriptional regulators.
AB  == in this work, we have studied the transcriptional regulation of the bzd operon involved in the anaerobic catabolism of benzoate in the denitrifying azoarcus sp. strain cib. the transcription start site of the p(n) promoter running the expression of the bzd catabolic genes was identified. gel retardation assays and  p(n)::lacz translational fusion experiments performed both in azoarcus sp. cib and escherichia coli cells have shown that bzdr encodes a specific repressor that controls the inducible expression of the adjacent bzd catabolic operon, being the first intermediate of the catabolic pathway (i.e. benzoyl-coa, the actual inducer molecule). this is the first report of a transcriptional repressor and a coa-derived aromatic inducer controlling gene expression in the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. dnase i footprinting experiments revealed that  bzdr protected three regions (operators) at the p(n) promoter. the three operators contain direct repetitions of a tgca sequence that forms part of longer palindromic structures. in agreement with the repressor role of bzdr, operator region i spans the transcription initiation site as well as the -10 sequence for  recognition of the rna polymerase. primary sequence analyses of bzdr showed an unusual modular organization with an n-terminal region homologous to members of the hth-xre family of transcriptional regulators and a c-terminal region similar  to shikimate kinases. a three-dimensional model of the n-terminal and c-terminal  regions of bzdr, generated by comparison with the crystal structures of the sinr  regulator from bacillus subtilis and the shikimate kinase i protein from e. coli, strongly suggests that they contain the helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif and the benzoyl-coa binding groove, respectively. the bzdr protein constitutes, therefore, the prototype of a new subfamily of transcriptional regulators.

AB  == two novel esterases (estb1 and estb2) were isolated from a genomic library of bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge aplysina aerophoba. estb1 shows low identity (26-44%) with the published hydrolases of the genus bacillus, whereas estb2 shows high identity (73-74%) with the carboxylesterases from b. cereus and b. anthracis. both esterases were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli under the control of t7 promoter using the vector pet-22b(+). recombinant estb1 was purified in a single step to electrophoretic homogeneity by imac. a method for the refolding of inclusion bodies formed by the recombinant estb2 was  established to obtain active enzyme. substrate specificity of the two enzymes towards p-nitrophenyl and methyl esters and the respective kinetic parameters k(m) and v(max) were determined. the temperature optima of estb1 and estb2 were determined to be in the range of 30-50 degrees c and 20-35 degrees c, respectively. the ph optima were found to be in the range of 6.5-7.5 and 6.5-8.0, respectively. both enzymes showed the highest stability in up to 50% (v/v) dmso followed by methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. the influence of high nacl and kcl  concentrations was tested. the inhibition effect of 10-50 mm zn(2+) and 50 mm mg(2+) and ca(2+) ions was observed for both esterases. one to five millimolar pmsf deactivated the enzymes, whereas beta-mercaptoethanol, dtt and edta had no effect on the enzymes activity.

TI  == development of a hybrid delta-endotoxin and its expression in tobacco and cotton  for control of a polyphagous pest spodoptera litura.
AB  == a hybrid delta-endotoxin protein was designed against a polyphagous lepidopteran  insect pest spodoptera litura, which is tolerant to most of the known delta-endotoxins. the hybrid delta-endotoxin was created by replacing amino acid  residues 530-587 in a poorly active natural cry1ea protein, with a highly homologous 70 amino acid region of cry1ca in domain iii. the truncated delta-endotoxins cry1ea, cry1ca and the hybrid protein cry1ec accumulated in escherichia coli to form inclusion bodies. the solubilised cry1ec made from e. coli was 4- fold more toxic to the larvae of s. litura than cry1ca, the best known delta-endotoxin against spodoptera sp. none of the two truncated toxins, solubilised from e. coli caused larval mortality. however, trypsinised cry1ca protoxin obtained from e. coli and solubilised from inclusion bodies caused mortality of s. litura with lc50 513 ng/ml semi synthetic diet. a synthetic gene  coding for the hybrid delta-endotoxin cry1ec was designed for high level expression in plants, taking into consideration several features found in the highly expressed plant genes. transgenic, single copy plants of tobacco as well as cotton were developed. the selected lines expressed cry1ec at 0.1-0.7% of soluble leaf protein. such plants were completely resistant to s. litura and caused 100% mortality in all stages of larval development. hence, unlike in e. coli, the hybrid delta-endotoxin folded into a functionally active conformation in both tobacco and cotton leaves. the truncated cry1ec expressed in tobacco leaves was about 8-fold more toxic (lc50 58 ng/ml diet) compared to expression in e. coli.

TI  == expression and secretion of a prokaryotic protein streptokinase without glycosylation and degradation in schizosaccharomyces pombe.
AB  == streptokinase (sk) is an important thrombolytic protein that is secreted by pathogenic strains of streptococcus. expression of streptokinase has been so far  attempted in pichia pastoris, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and shown to yield protein that was either highly glycosylated or degraded. since the fission  yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, shares several molecular characteristics with higher eukaryotes, we decided to express the streptokinase gene in this yeast. a  chimeric gene comprising the signal sequence of the plus pheromone of sz. pombe fused in-frame with the mature streptokinase from streptococcus sp. was constructed and inserted into the expression vector containing the thiamine-regulated promoter. we obtained a high level of expression of streptokinase comparable to that in e. coli and p. pastoris, with 50-100% processing of the signal sequence and secretion of the mature streptokinase into  the periplasmic fraction. the mature enzyme co-migrates with the authentic mature sk in sds gels, lacks any major modification and is functional. importantly, a higher level of expression under stationary phase conditions and improved extractability of the mature and undegraded streptokinase was achieved in a novel mutant of sz. pombe defective for a potent extracellular protease activity. we suggest that the unique vector/strain system developed here could be advantageous for large-scale production of prokaryotic proteins without significant modification or degradation in sz. pombe.

TI  == molecular characterization of a beta-1,4-endoglucanase from an endophytic bacillus pumilus strain.
AB  == endophytes comprise mainly microorganisms that colonize inner plant tissues, often living with the host in a symbiotic manner. several ecological roles have been assigned to endophytic fungi and bacteria, such as antibiosis to phytopathogenic agents and plant growth promotion. nowadays, endophytes are viewed as a new source of genes, proteins and biochemical compounds that may be used to improve industrial processes. in this study, the gene egla was cloned from a citrus endophytic bacillus strain. the egla encodes a beta-1,4-endoglucanase capable of hydrolyzing cellulose under in vitro conditions. the predicted protein, egla, has high homology to other bacterial cellulases and shows a modular structure containing a catalytic domain of the glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (gh9) and a cellulose-binding module type 3 (cbm3). the enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. egla has an optimum ph range of 5-8, and remarkable heat stability, retaining more than 85% activity even after a 24-h incubation at ph 6-8.6. this characteristic is an important feature for further applications of this enzyme in biotechnological processes in which temperatures of 50-60 degrees  c are required over long incubation periods.

TI  == use of heterotrophic co2 assimilation as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile bacteria.
AB  == we have examined whether assimilation of co2 can be used as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria. co2 assimilation by environmental samples and pure cultures of heterotrophic bacteria was studied using 14co2 and 13co2 as tracers. heterotrophic growth on complex organic substrates resulted in assimilation of co2 into cell biomass by activated sludge, drinking water biofilm, and pure cultures of escherichia coli atcc 25922, es. coli atcc 13706, rhodococcus ruber, burkholderia sp., bacillus circulans, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. analysis of 13c-labelled phospholipid fatty acids (plfas) confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria may assimilate 13co2 into cell macromolecules such as membrane lipids. all major plfas extracted from activated sludge and drinking water biofilm samples were enriched in 13c after incubation with co2. between 1.4% and 6.5% of  the biomass produced by cultures of p. putida and a drinking water biofilm during growth in complex media was apparently derived from assimilation of co2. resting  cells assimilated less co2 compared to actively growing cells, and co2 assimilation activity correlated with the amount of biomass produced during heterotrophic growth. the 14co2 assimilation assay was evaluated as a tool to examine inhibitory effects of biocides on planktonic and sessile heterotrophs (biofilms). on the basis of 14co2 assimilation activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of benzalkonium chloride was estimated to 21.1 and 127.2 mg l(-1) for planktonic and biofilm samples, respectively. the results indicate that assimilation of isotopically labelled co2 can be used as a relatively simple measure of metabolic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. co2 assimilation assays  may be used to study the effects of antimicrobial agents on growth and survival of planktonic and sessile heterotrophic organisms.

TI  == single amino acid mutations interchange the reaction specificities of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase and the acarbose-modifying enzyme acarviosyl transferase.
AB  == acarviosyl transferase (atase) from actinoplanes sp. se50/110 is a bacterial enzyme that transfers the acarviosyl moiety of the diabetic drug acarbose to sugar acceptors. the enzyme exhibits 42% sequence identity with cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases (cgtase), and both enzymes are members of the alpha-amylase  family, a large clan of enzymes acting on starch and related compounds. atase is  virtually inactive on starch, however. in contrast, atase is the only known enzyme to efficiently use acarbose as substrate (2 micromol min(-1) mg(-1)); acarbose is a strong inhibitor of cgtase and of most other alpha-amylase family enzymes. this distinct reaction specificity makes atase an interesting enzyme to  investigate the variation in reaction specificity of alpha-amylase family enzymes. here we show that a g140h mutation in atase, introducing the typical his of the conserved sequence region i of the alpha-amylase family, changed atase into an enzyme with 4-alpha-glucanotransferase activity (3.4 micromol min(-1) mg(-1)). moreover, this mutation introduced cyclodextrin-forming activity into atase, converting 2% of starch into cyclodextrins. the opposite experiment, removing this typical his side chain in cgtase (h140a), introduced acarviosyl transferase activity in cgtase (0.25 micromol min(-1) mg(-1)).

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == we have developed a novel cell surface display system by employing fadl as an anchoring motif, which is an outer membrane protein involved in long-chain fatty  acid transport in escherichia coli. a thermostable bacillus sp. strain tg43 lipase (44.5 kda) could be successfully displayed on the cell surface of e. coli  in an active form by c-terminal deletion-fusion of lipase at the ninth external loop of fadl. the localization of the truncated fadl-lipase fusion protein on the cell surface was confirmed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. lipase activity was mainly detected with whole cells, but not with the culture supernatant, suggesting that cell lysis was not a problem. the activity of cell surface-displayed lipase was examined at different temperatures and phs and was found to be the highest at 50 degrees c and ph 9 to 10. cell surface-displayed lipase was quite stable, even at 60 and 70 degrees c, and retained over 90% of the full activity after incubation at 50 degrees c for a week. as a potential application, cell surface-displayed lipase was used as a whole-cell catalyst for  kinetic resolution of racemic methyl mandelate. in 36 h of reaction, (s)-mandelic acid could be produced with the enantiomeric excess of 99% and the enantiomeric ratio of 292, which are remarkably higher than values obtained with crude lipase  or cross-linked lipase crystal. these results suggest that fadl may be a useful anchoring motif for displaying enzymes on the cell surface of e. coli for whole-cell biocatalysis.

AB  == flavin reductase is essential for the oxygenases involved in microbial dibenzothiophene (dbt) desulfurization. an enzyme of the thermophilic strain, bacillus sp. dsm411, was selected to couple with dbt monooxygenase (dszc) from rhodococcus erythropolis d-1. the flavin reductase was purified to homogeneity from bacillus sp. dsm411, and the native enzyme was a monomer of m(r) 16 kda. although the best substrates were flavin mononucleotide and nadh, the enzyme also used other flavin compounds and acted slightly on nitroaromatic compounds and nadph. the purified enzyme coupled with dszc and had a ferric reductase activity. among the flavin reductases so far characterized, the present enzyme is the most  thermophilic and thermostable. the gene coded for a protein of 155 amino acids with a calculated mass of 17,325 da. the enzyme was overproduced in escherichia coli, and the specific activity in the crude extracts was about 440-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain, bacillus sp. dsm411.

(sr)-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1h-quinazolin-4-one (4) and (rr)-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1h-quinazolin-4-one (5) are new natural products. 2-methyl-3h-quinazolin-4-one (2) and 1h-quinazoline-2,4-dione (3) are known from other bacteria and plants, respectively. from another streptomyces sp., gw2/577, 5-methyl-1h-quinazoline-2,4-dione (6) was isolated and the structure proven by comparison with the isomeric 7. the new natural products  showed no activity against the microalgae chlorella vulgaris, chlorella sorokiniana, and scenedesmus subspicatus, the fungus mucor miehei, the yeast candida albicans, and the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and streptomyces viridochromogenes.

TI  == mode of action of the microbial metabolite ge23077, a novel potent and selective  inhibitor of bacterial rna polymerase.
AB  == ge23077, a novel microbial metabolite recently isolated from actinomadura sp. culture media, is a potent and selective inhibitor of bacterial rna polymerase (rnap). it inhibits gram-positive (bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) rnaps with ic50 values (i.e. the concentration at which the enzyme activity is inhibited by 50%) in the 10(-8) m range, whereas it is not active on e. coli dna polymerase or on eukaryotic (wheat germ) rnap ii (ic50 values > 10(-4) m in both cases). in spite of its potent activity on purified bacterial rnaps, ge23077 shows a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. to investigate the molecular basis of this behaviour, the effects of ge23077 on macromolecular biosynthesis were tested in e. coli cells permeabilized under different conditions. the addition of ge23077 to plasmolyzed cells resulted in an immediate and specific inhibition of  intracellular rna biosynthesis, in a dose-response manner, strongly suggesting that cell penetration is the main obstacle for effective antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic. biochemical studies were also conducted with purified enzymes  to obtain further insights into the mode of action of ge23077. interestingly, the compound displays a behaviour similar to that of rifampicin, an antibiotic structurally unrelated to ge23077: both compounds act at the level of transcription initiation, but not on the sigma subunit and not on the formation of the promoter dna-rnap complex. tests on different rifampicin-resistant e. coli rnaps did not show any cross-resistance between the two compounds, indicating distinct binding sites on the target enzyme. in conclusion, ge23077 is an interesting new molecule for future mechanistic studies on bacterial rnap and for its potential in anti-infective drug discovery.

TI  == fungistatic and bacteriostatic activities of alkamides from heliopsis longipes roots: affinin and reduced amides.
AB  == this work demonstrates the fungistatic and bacteriostatic activities of affinin,  the main alkamide of heliopsis longipes (gray) blake (asteraceae) roots and two alkamides obtained by catalytic reduction of affinin: n-isobutyl-2e-decenamide and n-isobutyl-decanamide. the bioactivity was tested against rhizoctonia solani  groups ag3 and ag5, sclerotium rolfsii, sclerotium cepivorum, fusarium sp., vertcillium sp., phytopathogenic fungi; phytophthora infestans, a phytopathogenic chromista; saccharomyces cerevisiae, a nonphytopathogenic ascomycete; and escherichia coli, erwinia carotovora, and bacillus subtilis, bacteria. affinin, being the primary component of the lipidic fraction, is expected to be responsible for the fungitoxic activity observed in roots of this plant species.  four of the assayed fungi showed an important sensitivity to the presence of affinin: s. rolfsii, s. cepivorum, p. infestans, and r. solani ag-3 and ag-5, displaying a growth inhibition of 100%. s. cerevisiaeshowed a similar growth inhibition with affinin. none of the alkamides obtained by catalytic reduction of affinin showed a fungitoxic activity. affinin had a definite negative effect on the growth of e. coli and b. subtilis, but e. carotovora carotovora was not sensitive to the highest dose of affinin assayed. n-isobutyl-2e-decenamide displayed a higher bacteriostatic activity against e. coli and e. carotovora carotovora. in both cases, this alkamide was more potent than affinin. on the other hand, only n-isobutyl-decanamide displayed a significant activity on the growth of b. subtilis.

AB  == bacillus stearothermophilus leucine aminopeptidase ii (lapii) was fused at its c-terminal end with the raw-starch-binding domain of bacillus sp. strain ts-23 alpha-amylase. the chimeric enzyme (lapsbd), with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 61 kda, was overexpressed in iptg-induced escherichia coli cells and purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. the purified enzyme retained lap activity and adsorbed raw starch. lapsbd was stable at 70 degrees c  for 10 min, while the activity of wild-type enzyme was completely abolished under the same environmental condition. compared with the wild-type enzyme, the twofold increase in the catalytic efficiency for lapsbd was due to a 218% increase in the k(cat) value.

TI  == identification of the anabaena sp. strain pcc7120 cyanophycin synthetase as suitable enzyme for production of cyanophycin in gram-negative bacteria like pseudomonas putida and ralstonia eutropha.
AB  == the cyanophycin synthetase gene cpha1 encoding the major cyanophycin synthetase (cpha) of anabaena sp. strain pcc7120 was expressed in escherichia coli conferring so far the highest specific cpha activity to e. coli (6.7 nmol arginine per min and mg protein). cpha1 and cpha genes of synechocystis sp. strains pcc6803 and pcc6308 and synechococcus strain ma19 were also expressed in  wild types and polyhydroxyalkanoate-negative (pha) mutants of pseudomonas putida  and ralstonia eutropha. recombinant strains of these bacteria expressing cpha1 accumulated generally more cyanophycin (23.0 and 20.0% of cellular dry matter, cdm, respectively) than recombinants expressing any other cpha (6.8, 9.0, or 15.8% of cdm for p. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, or 14.1% of cdm for r. eutropha). furthermore, pha-negative mutants of p. putida (9.7, 10.0, 17.5, or 24.0% of cdm) and r. eutropha (8.9, 13.8, 16.0, or 22.0% of cdm) accumulated generally more cyanophycin than the corresponding pha-positive parent strains (6.8, 9.0, 15.8, and 23.0% of cdm for p. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, 14.1, or 20.0% of cdm for r. eutropha strains). recombinant strains of gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium, corynebacterium glutamicum) were not suitable for  cyanophycin production due to accumulation of less cyanophycin and retarded release of cyanophycin. pha-negative mutants of p. putida and r. eutropha expressing cpha1 of anabaena sp. strain pcc7120 are therefore preferred candidates for industrial production of cyanophycin.

AB  == cellobiohydrolase cel48c from paenibacillus sp. bp-23, an enzyme displaying limited activity on most cellulosic substrates, was assayed for activity in the presence of other bacterial endo- or exocellulases. significant enhanced activity was observed when cel48c was incubated in the presence of paenibacillus sp. bp-23 endoglucanase cel9b or thermobifida fusca cellulases cel6a and cel6b, indicating  that cel48c acts synergistically with them. maximum synergism rates on bacterial  microcrystalline cellulose or filter paper were obtained with a mixture of paenibacillus cellulases cel9b and cel48c, accompanied by t. fusca exocellulase cel6b. synergism was also observed in cell extracts from recombinant clone e. coli pucel9-cel48 expressing the two contiguous paenibacillus cellulases cel9b and cel48c. the enhanced cellulolytic activity displayed by the cellulase mixtures assayed could be used as an efficient tool for biotechnological applications like pulp and paper manufacturing.

TI  == production of autoproteolytically subunit-assembled 7-beta-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporanic acid (gl-7aca) acylase from pseudomonas sp. c427 using a chitin-binding domain.
AB  == 7-beta-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporanic acid (gl-7aca) acylase from pseudomonas sp. c427 is known as a proteolytically processed bacterial enzyme. gl-7aca acylase from pseudomonas sp. c427 (c427) consists of alpha- and beta-subunits that are processed from a precursor peptide by removing the spacer  peptide. a chitin-binding domain (cbd) of chitinase a1 derived from bacillus circulans was genetically fused into four different positions of the c427-encoding gene. in the four enzymes thereby produced, nalpha427, sp427, calpha427, and cbeta427, it was fused, respectively, to the n-terminal region of  the alpha-subunit; the c-terminal region of the alpha-subunit; the three-amino-acid upper region of the c-terminal of the alpha-subunit; and to the  c-terminal region of the beta-subunit. all of the fusion enzymes, expressed in eschericha coli, were successfully processed into active forms and had gl-7aca acylase activity. the affinity-binding activity to crystalline chitin was affected by the fusing position of cbd. nalpha427, calpha427, and cbeta427 remained fused to the cbd after their processing steps and could bind to chitin,  but in the case of sp427 the fused cbd was cleaved away during the processing steps and binding activity was no longer observed. these results indicate that cbd is functional in such autoproteolytically subunit-assembled acylases.

AB  == thermophilic bacteria bacillus subtilis wu-s2b and mycobacterium phlei wu-f1 desulfurize dibenzothiophene (dbt) and alkylated dbts through specific cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bonds over a temperature range up to 52 degrees c. in order  to identify and functionally analyze the dbt-desulfurization genes, the gene cluster containing bdsa, bdsb, and bdsc was cloned from b. subtilis wu-s2b. the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of bdsabc show homologies to those of the other known dbt-desulfurization genes and enzymes; e.g. a nucleotide sequence homology of 61.0% to dszabc of the mesophilic bacterium rhodococcus sp. igts8 and 57.8% to tdsabc of the thermophilic bacterium paenibacillus sp. a11-2. deletion and subcloning analysis of bdsabc revealed that the gene products of bdsc, bdsa and bdsb oxidized dbt to dbt sulfone (dbto(2)), converted dbto(2) to 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate (hbpsi), and desulfurized hbpsi to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-hbp), respectively. resting cells of a recombinant escherichia coli jm109 harboring bdsabc converted dbt to 2-hbp over a temperature range of 30-52 degrees c, indicating that the gene products of bdsabc were functional in the recombinant. the activities of dbt degradation at 50 degrees c  and dbt desulfurization (2-hbp production) at 40 degrees c in resting cells of the recombinant were approximately five times and twice, respectively, as high as those in b. subtilis wu-s2b. the recombinant e. coli cells also degraded alkylated dbts, such as 2,8-dimethyldbt and 4,6-dimethyldbt. the nucleotide sequences of b. subtilis wu-s2b bdsabc and the corresponding genes from m. phlei  wu-f1 were found to be completely identical to each other although the strains are genetically different.

AB  == the ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to  estimate membrane polarization values. however, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. the cytoplasmic membrane polarization values  for arthrobacter sp. atcc 21908, bacillus cereus nrc 3045, pseudomonas fluorescens r2f, pseudomonas putida nrc 2986 and escherichia coli c600 bacterial  cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees c, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using  the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. at an assay temperature of 10 degrees c,  e. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for b. cereus, arthrobacter sp., p. fluorescens and p. putida. at an assay temperature of 30 degrees c, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in  the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. b. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. regardless of  the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees c. to our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also  for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.

AB  == enzymes from thermophiles are preferred for industrial applications because they  generally show improved tolerance to temperature, pressure, solvents, and ph as compared with enzymes from mesophiles. however, nearly all thermostable enzymes used in industrial applications or available commercially are produced as recombinant enzymes in mesophiles, typically escherichia coli. the development of high-temperature bioprocesses, particularly those involving cofactor-requiring enzymes and/or multi-step enzymatic pathways, requires a thermophilic host. the extreme thermophile most amenable to genetic manipulation is thermus thermophilus, but the study of expression of heterologous genes in t. thermophilus is in its infancy. while several heterologous genes have previously  been expressed in t. thermophilus, the data reported here include the first examples of the functional expression of a gene from an archaeal hyperthermophile ( bgla from pyrococcus woesei), a cofactor-requiring enzyme ( dszc from rhodococcus erythropolis igts8), and a two-component enzyme ( carba and carbb from sphingomonas sp. gtin11). a thermostable derivative of pnba from bacillus subtilis was also expressed, further expanding the list of genes from heterologous hosts that have been expressed in t. thermophilus.

AB  == all the archaeal genomes sequenced to date contain a single type 2 rnase h gene.  we found that the genome of a halophilic archaeon, halobacterium sp. nrc-1, contains an open reading frame with similarity to type 1 rnase h. the protein encoded by the vng0255c gene, possessed amino acid sequence identities of 33% with escherichia coli rnase hi and 34% with a bacillus subtilis rnase hi homologue. the b. subtilis rnase hi homologue, however, lacks amino acid sequences corresponding to a basic protrusion region of the e. coli rnase hi, and the vng0255c has the similar deletion. as this deletion apparently conferred a complete loss of rnase h activity on the b. subtilis rnase hi homologue protein,  the vng0255c product was expected to exhibit no rnase h activity. however, the purified recombinant vng0255c protein specifically cleaved an rna strand of the rna/dna hybrid in vitro, and when the vng0255c gene was expressed in an e. coli strain mic2067 it could suppress the temperature-sensitive growth defect associated with the loss of rnase h enzymes of this strain. these results in vitro and in vivo strongly indicate that the halobacterium vng0255c is the first  archaeal type 1 rnase h. this enzyme, unlike other type 1 rnases h, was able to cleave an okazaki fragment-like substrate at the junction between the 3'-side of  ribonucleotide and 5'-side of deoxyribonucleotide. it is likely that the archaeal type 1 rnase h plays a role in the removal of the last ribonucleotide of the rna  primer from the okazaki fragment during dna replication.

AB  == in an effort to improve the properties of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (cgtase) as an antistaling enzyme, error-prone pcr was used to introduce random mutations into a cgtase cloned from alkalophilic bacillus sp. i-5 (cgtase i-5). a mutant cgtase[3-18] with the three mutations m234t, f259i and v591a was selected  by agar plate assay. sequence alignment of various cgtases indicated that m234 and f259 are located in the vicinity of the catalytic sites of the enzyme and v591 in the starch binding domain e. the cyclization activity of cgtase[3-18] was dramatically decreased by 10-fold, while the hydrolyzing activity was increased by up to 15-fold. these mutations near subsite +1 (m234t) and at subsite +2 (f259i) are likely to alter the enzyme activity in a concerted manner, promoting  hydrolysis of substrate while retarding cyclization. the addition of cgtase[3-18] reduced the retrogradation rate of bread by as much as did the commercial antistaling enzyme novamyl during 7-day storage at 4 degrees c. no cyclodextrin (cd) was detected in bread treated with cgtase[3-18], whereas 21 mg of cd per 10  g of bread was produced in bread treated with wild-type cgtase.

AB  == attempted allelic replacement of 144 streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. of these, 14 genes (obg, spoiiij2, trmu, yaca, yacm, ydic, ydie, yjbn, ynes, yphc, ysxc, ytag, yloi and yxeh4) were also essential in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae or escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrk and ydib) were only essential in h. influenzae as well as s. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of s.pneumoniae and s. aureus and did not have a homolog in h. influenzae(murd2, ykqc, ylqf, yqeh, ytgp, yybq) or were not essential in that organism (yqel, yhct). the proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. the putative functions of some of these  essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to  be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting  that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. the results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including bacillus subtilis, e. coli and mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures  can produce apparently contradictory results.

TI  == interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) and two novel classes of  pbp inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.
AB  == several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. the mics of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus mi339 and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium ef12. several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of s. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of bacillus megaterium. the effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on e. coli pbp 3 and pbp 5, streptococcus pneumoniae pbp 2xs (pbp 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and pbp 2xr (pbp 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity pbp 2a of s. aureus, and the actinomadura sp. strain r39 and streptomyces sp. strain r61 dd-peptidases were studied. some of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities in the 10 to 100 microm concentration range. the  inhibition of pbp 2xs by several of them appeared to be noncompetitive. the dissociation constant for the best inhibitor (ki = 10 microm) was not influenced  by the presence of the substrate.

TI  == cloning and analysis of wf146 protease, a novel thermophilic subtilisin-like protease with four inserted surface loops.
AB  == cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding wf146 protease, an extracellular subtilisin-like protease from the thermophile bacillus sp. wf146, revealed that the wf146 protease was translated as a 416-amino acid precursor consisting of a putative 18-amino acid signal peptide, a 10-kda n-terminal propeptide and a 32-kda mature protease region. the mature wf146 protease shares a high degree of  amino acid sequence identity with two psychrophilic subtilisins, s41 (68.2%) and  s39 (65.4%), and a mesophilic subtilisin, ssii (67.1%). significantly, these closely related proteases adapted to different temperatures all had four inserted surface loops not found in other subtilisins. however, unlike those of s41, s39 and ssii, the inserted loops of the wf146 protease possessed stabilizing features, such as the introduction of pro residues into the loop regions. interestingly, the wf146 protease contained five of the seven mutations previously found in a hyperstable variant of subtilisin s41 obtained by directed  evolution. the proform of wf146 protease (pro-wf146 protease) was overexpressed in escherichia coli in an inactive soluble form. after heat treatment, the 42-kda pro-wf146 protease converted to a 32-kda active mature form by processing the n-terminal propeptide. the purified mature wf146 protease hydrolyzed casein with  an optimum temperature of 85 degrees c, and lost activity with a half-life of 30  min at 80 degrees c in the presence of 10 mm cacl2.

TI  == posttranslational processing of polysaccharide lyase: maturation route for gellan lyase in bacillus sp. gl1.
AB  == cells of bacillus sp. gl1 extracellularly secrete a gellan lyase with a molecular mass of 130 kda responsible for the depolymerization of a heteropolysaccharide (gellan), although the gene is capable of encoding a huge protein with a molecular mass of 263 kda. a maturation route for gellan lyase in the bacterium was determined using anti-gellan lyase antibodies. the fluid of the bacterial exponentially growing cultures on gellan contained two proteins with molecular masses of 260 and 130 kda, both of which reacted with the antibodies. the 260 kda protein was purified from the cultured fluid and characterized. the protein exhibited gellan lyase activity and showed similar enzyme properties, such as optimal ph and temperature, thermal stability, and substrate specificity, to those of the 130 kda gellan lyase. the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the 260 and 130 kda enzymes were found to be identical. determination of the c-terminal amino acid of the 130 kda enzyme indicated that the 260 kda enzyme is cleaved between the 1205gly and 1206leu residues to yield the mature form (130 kda) of the gellan lyase. therefore, the mature enzyme consists of 1170 amino acids (36ala-1205gly) with a molecular weight of 125,345, which is in good agreement with that calculated from sds-page analysis. judging from these results, gellan lyase is first synthesized as a preproform (263 kda) and then secreted as a precursor (260 kda) into the medium through cleavage of the signal peptide. finally, the precursor is post-translationally processed into the n-terminal half domain of 130 kda as the mature form, the function of c-terminal half domain being unclear.

TI  == thermobaculum terrenum gen. nov., sp. nov.: a non-phototrophic gram-positive thermophile representing an environmental clone group related to the chloroflexi  (green non-sulfur bacteria) and thermomicrobia.
AB  == a novel bacterium was cultivated from an extreme thermal soil in yellowstone national park, wyoming, usa, that at the time of sampling had a ph of 3.9 and a temperature range of 65-92 degrees c. this organism was found to be an obligate aerobic, non-spore-forming rod, and formed pink-colored colonies. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence placed this organism in a clade composed entirely of environmental clones most closely related to the phyla chloroflexi and thermomicrobia. this bacterium stained gram-positive, contained a novel fatty-acid profile, had cell wall muramic acid content similar to that of bacillus subtilis (significantly greater than escherichia coli), and failed to display a lipopolysaccharide profile in sds-polyacrylamide gels that would be indicative of a gram-negative cell wall structure. ultrastructure examinations with transmission electron microscopy showed a thick cell wall (approximately 34  nm wide) external to a cytoplasmic membrane. the organism was not motile under the culture conditions used, and electron microscopic examination showed no evidence of flagella. genomic g+c content was 56.4 mol%, and growth was optimal at 67 degrees c and at a ph of 7.0. this organism was able to grow heterotrophically on various carbon compounds, would use only oxygen as an electron acceptor, and its growth was not affected by light. a new species of a novel genus is proposed, with ynp1(t) (t=type strain) being thermobaculum terrenum gen. nov., sp. nov. (16s rdna gene genbank accession af391972). this bacterium has been deposited in the american type culture collection (atcc baa-798) and the university of oregon culture collection of microorganisms from extreme environments (ccmee 7001).

TI  == bacillus subtilis ypga gene is fni, a nonessential gene encoding type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.
AB  == we previously identified the fni gene of streptomyces sp. strain cl190 as type 2  isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) isomerase, which needs both fmn and nadph for enzyme activity. an fni gene homolog, ypga, was detected in the database of the bacillus subtilis genome. however, the ypga product was about 140 amino acids shorter in the n-terminal than the streptomyces fni gene product. a database search found three new putative start codons in 129, 225, and 411 bases upstream  of the original start codon of the ypga gene. the longest gene product, which was named ypga3, showed the most significant homology to the streptomyces fni gene product. the ypga3 gene was expressed with an n-terminal his-tag in escherichia coli and the purified soluble protein was characterized in detail. the ypga3 protein converted ipp to its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate in the presence of  both fmn and nadph. the enzyme also catalyzed the reverse reaction in the presence of both the cofactors. disruption of the ypga3 gene was not lethal to b. subtilis. these results indicate that bacillus ypga3 gene is fni, a nonessential  gene encoding type 2 ipp isomerase.

TI  == specificity and enzyme kinetics of the quorum-quenching n-acyl homoserine lactone lactonase (ahl-lactonase).
AB  == n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals are the vital elements of  bacterial quorum-sensing systems, which regulate diverse biological functions, including virulence. the ahl-lactonase, a quorumquenching enzyme encoded by aiia  from bacillus sp., inactivates ahls by hydrolyzing the lactone bond to produce corresponding n-acyl homoserines. to characterize the enzyme, the recombinant ahl-lactonase and its four variants were purified. kinetic and substrate specificity analysis showed that ahl-lactonase had no or little residue activity  to non-acyl lactones and noncyclic esters, but displayed strong enzyme activity toward all tested ahls, varying in length and nature of the substitution at the c3 position of the acyl chain. the data also indicate that the amide group and the ketone at the c1 position of the acyl chain of ahls could be important structural features in enzyme-substrate interaction. surprisingly, although carrying a (104)hx- hxdh(109) short sequence identical to the zinc-binding motif  of several groups of metallohydrolytic enzymes, ahl-lactonase does not contain or require zinc or other metal ions for enzyme activity. except for the amino acid residue his-104, which was shown previously to not be required for catalysis, kinetic study and conformational analysis using circular dichroism spectrometry showed that substitution of the other key residues in the motif (his-106, asp-108, and his-109), as well as his-169 with serine, respectively, caused conformational changes and significant loss of enzyme activity. we conclude that  ahl-lactonase is a highly specific enzyme and that the (106)hxdh(109) approximately h(169) of ahl-lactonase represents a novel catalytic motif, which does not rely on zinc or other metal ions for activity.

TI  == relationships among ecology, demography and diseases of european bison (bison bonasus).
AB  == the bison population in the bialowieza forest in poland has now grown to approximately 300, while the herds in the belarusian part of the forest total about 240 bison. the first signs of a health problem in these herds appeared in 1980, when two cases of balanoposthitis were detected in two bulls (2 and 5 years of age). since 1980 research has been conducted to explain the cause of diseases, particularly balanoposthitis, and to monitor the health of bison in bialowieza forest. a total number of 614 bison (294 male and 320 female) of different ages was eliminated between 1980 and 2000. not all the culled bison were examined (postmortem analysis, histopathological, bacteriological, virological and toxicological examinations, serological tests, molecular research). based on the  increase in numbers, reproduction in this population for the past 21 years is generally considered successful. among 182 male bison eliminated during 1990-2000, only 85, or 47%, of the animals had balanoposthitis. thus, the percentage of balanoposthitis cases went from 100% during the 1980s down to 47% in the past decade. it appears that the culling process has been a major factor leading to this decrease. it can be assumed that a set of factors is involved in  the appearance of the disease (corynebacterium spp., bacillus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, ureoplasma spp, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptoccocus spp., staphyloccocus spp.) while opportunistic infections including nematodes (onchocerca spp.) are responsible for the occurrence of secondary lesions.

TI  == structure of mrsd, an fad-binding protein of the hfcd family.
AB  == mrsd from bacillus sp. hil-y85/54728 is a member of the hfcd (homo-oligomeric flavin-containing cys decarboxylases) family of flavoproteins and is involved in  the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic mersacidin. it catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of the c-terminal cysteine residue of the mrsa precursor peptide  of mersacidin, yielding a (z)-enethiol intermediate as the first step in the formation of the unusual amino acid s-[(z)-2-aminovinyl]-methyl-d-cysteine. surprisingly, mrsd was found to bind fad, in contrast to the three other characterized members of the hfcd family, which bind fmn. to determine the molecular discriminators of fad binding within the hfcd family, the crystal structure of mrsd was analyzed at a resolution of 2.54 a. crystals of space group f432 contain one mrsd monomer in the asymmetric unit. however, a patterson search with epid-derived models failed. based on the consideration that the dodecameric  mrsd particle of tetrahedral symmetry resembles the quaternary structure of epid, rotational and translational parameters were derived from the geometric consideration that the mrsd dodecamer is generated from a monomer by crystallographic symmetry around the position (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) of the unit cell. a structural comparison with the fmn-binding members of the hfcd family epid and athal3a shows conserved sequence motifs in contact with the flavin's pyrimidine ring but divergent environments for the dimethylbenzene ring of the isoalloxazine moiety. the position of the ribityl chain differs in mrsd from that found in epid and athal3a. however, the fmn-phosphate binding sites are also highly conserved in their exact positions. in all three cases, the flavin cofactor is bound to a structurally conserved region of the rossmann-fold monomer, exposing its re side  for catalysis. the adenosyl phosphate of fad is anchored in a well defined binding site and the adenosine moieties are oriented towards the interior of the  hollow particle, where three of them pack against each other around the threefold axis of a trimeric facet.

AB  == quorum sensing is a signalling mechanism that controls diverse biological functions, including virulence, via n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria. with the aim of isolating strains or enzymes capable of blocking quorum sensing by inactivating ahl, bacteria were screened for ahl degradation by their ability to utilize n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl) as the sole carbon source. among four isolates, strain ibn110, identified as arthrobacter sp., was found to grow rapidly on ohhl, and to degrade various ahls with different lengths and acyl side-chain substitutions. co-culture of arthrobacter sp. ibn110 and the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora significantly reduced both the ahl amount and pectate lyase activity in co-culture medium, suggesting the possibility of applying arthrobacter sp. ibn110 in the control of ahl-producing pathogenic bacteria. the ahld gene from arthrobacter sp. ibn110 encoding the enzyme catalysing ahl degradation was cloned, and found to encode a protein of 273 amino acids. a mass spectrometry analysis showed that ahld probably hydrolyses the lactone ring of n-3-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, indicating that ahld is an n-acylhomoserine lactonase (ahlase). a comparison of ahld with other known ahl-degrading enzymes,  bacillus sp. 240b1 aiia, a bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kyushuensis aiia homologue and agrobacterium tumefaciens attm, revealed 25, 26 and 21 % overall identities, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequences. although these identities were relatively low, the hxdh approximately h approximately d motif was conserved in all the ahlases, suggesting that this motif is essential for ahlase activity. from a genome database search based on the conserved motif, putative ahld-like lactonase genes were found in several other bacteria, and ahl-degrading activities were observed in klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus stearothermophilus. furthermore, it was verified that ahlk, an ahld homologue, encodes an ahl-degrading enzyme in k. pneumoniae. accordingly, the current results suggest the possibility that ahld-like ahlases could exist in many other  micro-organisms.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of the ces10 gene encoding a sphingomonas paucimobilis esterase.
AB  == the ces10 gene of the gellan gum-producing strain sphingomonas paucimobilis atcc  31461 was cloned and sequenced. multi-sequence alignment of the deduced protein indicated that ces10 belongs to the serine hydrolase family with a potential catalytic triad comprising ser(153) (within the g-x-s-x-g consensus sequence), his(75) and asp(125). the mixed block results obtained following pattern search and the low identities detected in a blast analysis indicate that ces10 is significantly different from other characterised bacterial esterases/lipases. nevertheless, the ces10 amino acid sequence showed 45% similarity with rhodococcus sp. heroin esterase and 48% with bacillus subtilis p-nitrobenzyl esterase. ces10, with a predicted molecular mass of 30,641 da, was overproduced in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity in a histidine-tagged form. enzyme assays using p-nitrophenyl-esters (p-np-esters) with different acyl chain-lengths as the substrate confirmed the anticipated esterase activity. ces10 exhibited a marked preference for short-chain fatty acids, yielding the highest activity with p-np-propionate (optimal ph 7.4, optimal temperature 37 degrees c).

TI  == a novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 88: overexpression, purification, and characterization of unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1.
AB  == unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced through the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate, and chondroitin lyases. an overexpression system for the enzyme was  constructed in escherichia coli cells involving regulation of the enzyme gene under the t7 promoter and terminator. the expression level of the enzyme in e. coli cells was 250-fold higher than that in bacillus sp. gl1 cells. the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells was purified and characterized. the optimal ph and temperature, and substrate specificity of the purified enzyme were similar to those of the native enzyme from bacillus sp. gl1 cells, although the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells underwent self-assembly into polymeric forms through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme was rich in alpha-helices. genes showing high identity (over 40% identity) with that of the enzyme were found in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause serious diseases (e.g., meningitis and  pneumonia). therefore, the enzyme of bacillus sp. gl1 and the streptococcal proteins form a new glycoside hydrolase family, 88.

TI  == crystal structure of thermostable aspartase from bacillus sp. ym55-1: structure-based exploration of functional sites in the aspartase family.
AB  == the crystal structure of the thermostable aspartase from bacillus sp. ym55-1 has  been solved and refined for 2.5a resolution data with an r-factor of 22.1%. the present enzyme is a homotetramer with subunits composed of three domains. it exhibits no allosteric effects, in contrast to the escherichia coli aspartase, which is activated by divalent metal cation and l-aspartate, but is four-times more active than the e.coli enzyme. the overall folding of the present enzyme subunit is similar to those of the e.coli aspartase and the e.coli fumarase c, both of which belong to the same superfamily as the present enzyme. a local structural comparison of these three enzymes revealed seven structurally different regions. five of the regions were located around putative functional sites, suggesting the involvement of these regions into the functions characteristic of the enzymes. of these regions, the region of gln96-gly100 is proposed as a part of the recognition site of the alpha-amino group in l-aspartate for aspartase and the hydroxyl group in l-malate for fumarase. the region of gln315-gly323 is a flexible loop with a well-conserved sequence that is suggested to be involved in the catalytic reaction. the region of lys123-lys128 corresponds to a part of the putative activator-binding site in the e.coli fumarase c. the region in the bacillus aspartase, however, adopts a main-chain conformation that prevents the activator binding. the regions of gly228-glu241 and val265-asp272, which form a part of the active-site wall, are suggested to be involved in the allosteric activation of the e.coli aspartase by the binding of the metal ion and the activator. moreover, an increase in the numbers of intersubunit hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges is observed in the bacillus aspartase relative to those of the e.coli enzyme, implying a contribution to the  thermostability of the present aspartase.

TI  == high-level expression of a novel fmn-dependent heme-containing lyase, phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase of bacillus sp. strain oxb-1, in heterologous hosts.
AB  == we examined the overexpression of a novel fmn-dependent heme-containing lyase, phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase (oxd) of bacillus sp. strain oxb-1, in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. several plasmids were constructed to express the enzyme under the control of the lac promoter or its own promoter, together with or without nitrilase and a possible regulatory protein that is present in the wild-type genome. the enzyme was expressed using e. coli transfected with the plasmid poxd-9of. expression was under the control of the lac promoter in the puc18 vector and was much more effective when the start codon was changed from ttg to atg. when the transfected cells were grown at 37 degrees c, the enzyme was produced mainly in inactive inclusion bodies, whereas the enzyme was largely soluble and active when the cells were grown at 30 degrees c. the production of active enzyme was markedly enhanced by increasing the volume of culture medium. this had the effect of slowing the rate of apoenzyme synthesis. a slow rate of synthesis allows for a more efficient incorporation of heme cofactor into the apoenzyme than a fast rate of synthesis. under optimized conditions, the enzyme was produced in an active and soluble form at 15,000u/l of culture, which is about 1500-fold higher than the amount produced by the wild-type strain. moreover, the enzyme comprised over 40% of total extractable cellular protein.

TI  == localization of mn(ii)-oxidizing activity and the putative multicopper oxidase, mnxg, to the exosporium of the marine bacillus sp. strain sg-1.
AB  == dormant spores of the marine bacillus sp. strain sg-1 catalyze the oxidation of manganese(ii), thereby becoming encrusted with insoluble mn(iii,iv) oxides. in this study, it was found that the mn(ii)-oxidizing activity could be removed from sg-1 spores using a french press and recovered in the supernatant following centrifugation of the spores. transmission electron microscopy of thin sections of sg-1 spores revealed that the ridged outermost layer was removed by passage through the french press, leaving the remainder of the spore intact. comparative  chemical analysis of this layer with the underlying spore coats suggested that this outer layer is chemically distinct from the spore coat. taken together, these results indicate that this outer layer is an exosporium. previous genetic analysis of strain sg-1 identified a cluster of genes involved in mn(ii) oxidation, the mnx genes. the product of the most downstream gene in this cluster, mnxg, appears to be a multicopper oxidase and is essential for mn(ii) oxidation. in this study, mnxg was overexpressed in escherichia coli and used to  generate polyclonal antibodies. western blot analysis demonstrated that mnxg is localized to the exosporium of wild-type spores but is absent in the non-oxidizing spores of transposon mutants within the mnx gene cluster. to our knowledge, mn(ii) oxidation is the first oxidase activity, and mnxg one of the first gene products, ever shown to be associated with an exosporium.

TI  == specific phosphorothioate substitutions probe the active site of bacillus subtilis ribonuclease p.
AB  == ribonuclease p (rnase p) is a ribonucleoprotein that requires magnesium ions to catalyze the 5' maturation of transfer rna. to identify interactions essential for catalysis, the properties of rnase p containing single sulfur substitutions for nonbridging phosphodiester oxygens in helix p4 of bacillus subtilis rnase p were analyzed using transient kinetic experiments. sulfur substitution at the nonbridging oxygens of the phosphodiester bond of nucleotide u51 only modestly affects catalysis. however, phosphorothioate substitutions at a49 and g50 decrease the cleavage rate constant enormously (300-4,000-fold for p rna and 500-15,000-fold for rnase p holoenzyme) in magnesium without affecting the affinity of pre-trna(asp), highlighting the importance of this region for catalysis. furthermore, addition of manganese enhances pre-trna cleavage catalyzed by b. subtilis rnase p rna containing an sp phosphorothioate modification at a49, as observed for escherichia coli p rna [christian et al., rna, 2000, 6:511-519], suggesting that an essential metal ion may be coordinated  at this site. in contrast, no manganese rescue is observed for the a49 sp phosphorothioate modification in rnase p holoenzyme. these differential manganese rescue effects, along with affinity cleavage, suggest that the protein component  may interact with a metal ion bound near a49 in helix p4 of p rna.

TI  == deletion analysis of the c-terminal region of the alpha-amylase of bacillus sp. strain ts-23.
AB  == the alpha-amylase from bacillus sp. strain ts-23 is a secreted starch hydrolase with a domain organization similar to that of other microbial alpha-amylases and  an additional functionally unknown domain (amino acids 517-613) in the c-terminal region. by sequence comparison, we found that this latter domain contained a sequence motif typical for raw-starch binding. to investigate the functional role of the c-terminal region of the alpha-amylase of bacillus sp. strain ts-23, four  his(6)-tagged mutants with extensive deletions in this region were constructed and expressed in escherichia coli. sds-page and activity staining analyses showed that the n- and c-terminally truncated alpha-amylases had molecular masses of approximately 65, 58, 54, and 49 kda. progressive loss of raw-starch-binding activity occurred upon removal of c-terminal amino acid residues, indicating the  requirement for the entire region in formation of a functional starch-binding domain. up to 98 amino acids from the c-terminal end of the alpha-amylase could be deleted without significant effect on the raw-starch hydrolytic activity or thermal stability. furthermore, the active mutants hydrolyzed raw corn starch to  produce maltopentaose as the main product, suggesting that the raw-starch hydrolytic activity of the bacillus sp. strain ts-23 alpha-amylase is functional  and independent from the starch-binding domain.

TI  == purification, characterization and cloning of a chitinase from bacillus sp. nctu2.
AB  == a chitin-degrading bacillus strain, designated as nctu2, was screened from soil and identified. an extracellular chitinase was purified to >90% homogeneity from  the culture filtrate. the purification involved hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatographic separations with a yield of 58%. the purified enzyme (chinctu2) is a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular mass of 36.5 kda and a pi of 6.3. it is thermally stable at 60 degrees c and ph 6-8 for more than 3 h. the optimal activity is in the range of 50-60 degrees c at ph 7.0. chitobiose is the predominant product throughout the enzymic hydrolysis of the colloidal chitin, indicating that the purified chitinase is an exo-chitinase. chito-oligosaccharides [with degree of polymerization (dp) values of 4-6] are good substrates of the purified enzyme, whereas a dp3 oligomer was slowly hydrolysed to form dp1 and dp2 sugars. the first 15 n-terminal amino acids of the enzyme were determined to be annlgskllvgywhn, which is highly homologous to that  of chia from bacillus cereus. a pcr cloning technique was employed to obtain the  corresponding gene from bacillus nctu2. the gene sequence was determined to be 1080 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with the first 27 amino acids  as the signal peptide.

TI  == flavones inhibit the hexameric replicative helicase repa.
AB  == helicases couple the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (ntps) to the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids and are essential in dna metabolism. thus far, no inhibitors are known for helicases except heliquinomycin isolated from streptomyces sp. as the three-dimensional structure of the hexameric replicative dna helicase repa encoded by the broad host-range plasmid rsf1010 is  known, this protein served as a model helicase to search for inhibitory compounds. the commercially available flavone derivatives luteolin, morin, myricetin and dimyricetin (an oxidation product of myricetin) inhibited the atpase and double-stranded dna unwinding activities of repa. dimyricetin was the  most effective inhibitor for both activities. single-stranded dna-dependent repa  atpase activity is inhibited non-competitively by all four compounds. this finding contrasts the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by flavones that fit into the atp binding pocket of this enzyme. myricetin also inhibited the growth of a gram-positive and a gram-negative bacterial species. as we found other hexameric and non-hexameric prokaryotic helicases to be differentially sensitive to myricetin, flavones may provide substructures for the design of molecules helpful for unraveling the mechanism of helicase action and of novel pharmacologically useful molecules.

AB  == we report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, pseudomonas sp. strain tk4. the sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. the recombinant 57.7-kda enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase c. the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at ph 8.0 and activated by mn(2+). the enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (nbd)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and nbd-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria ivanovii, and leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical  protein encoded in chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the c terminus of the tk4 enzyme. interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain tk4 lacking 186 amino acids  at the c-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the c-terminal region of the tk4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.

TI  == the twin-arginine signal peptide of phod and the tatad/cd proteins of bacillus subtilis form an autonomous tat translocation system.
AB  == the bacterial twin-arginine translocation (tat) pathway has been recently described for phod of bacillus subtilis, a phosphodiesterase containing a twin-arginine signal peptide. the expression of phod is co-regulated with the expression of tata(d) and tatc(d) genes localized downstream of phod. to characterize the specificity of phod transport further, translocation of phod was investigated in escherichia coli. by using gene fusions, we analyzed the particular role of the signal peptide and the mature region of phod in canalizing the transport route. a hybrid protein consisting of the signal peptide of beta-lactamase and mature phod was transported in a sec-dependent manner indicating that the mature part of phod does not contain information canalizing the selected translocation route. pre-phod, as well as a fusion protein consisting of the signal peptide of phod (sp(phod)) and beta-galactosidase (lacz), remained cytosolic in the e. coli. thus, sp(phod) is not recognized by e. coli transport systems. co-expression of b. subtilis tata(d)/c(d) genes resulted  in the processing of sp(phod)-lacz and periplasmic localization of lacz illustrating a close substrate specificity of the tata(d)/c(d) transport system.  while blockage of the sec-dependent transport did not affect the localization of  sp(phod)-lacz, translocation and processing was dependent on the ph gradient of the cytosolic membrane. thus, the minimal requirement of a functional tat-dependent protein translocation system consists of a twin-arginine signal peptide-containing tat substrate, its specific tata/c proteins, and the ph gradient across the cytosolic membrane.

AB  == alkaline cellulase-producing actinomycete strains were isolated from mud samples  collected from east african soda lakes. the strains were identified as novel streptomyces spp. by 16s rdna sequence analysis. a cellulase gene (cel12a) from streptomyces sp. strain 11ag8 was cloned by expression screening of a genomic dna library in escherichia coli. from the nucleotide sequence of a 1.5-kb dna fragment, an open reading frame of 1,113 nucleotides was identified encoding a protein of 371 amino acids. from computer analysis of the sequence, it was deduced that the cel12a mature enzyme is a protein of 340 amino acids. the protein contained a catalytic domain, a glycine-rich linker region, and a cellulose-binding domain of 221, 12, and 107 amino acids, respectively. fasta analysis of the catalytic domain of cel12a classified the enzyme as a family 12 endoglucanase and the cellulose-binding domain as a family iia cbd. streptomyces  rochei egls was determined as nearest neighbor with a similarity of 75.2% and 61.0% to the catalytic domain and the cellulose-binding domain, respectively. the cell2a gene was subcloned in a bacillus high-expression vector carrying the bacillus amyloliquefaciens amylase regulatory sequences, and the construct was transformed to a bacillus subtilis host strain. crude enzyme preparations were obtained by ultrafiltration of cultures of the bacillus subtilis recombinant strain containing the 11ag8 cell2a gene. the enzyme showed carboxymethylcellulase (cmcase) activities over a broad ph range (5-10) with an optimum activity at ph 8 and 50 degrees c. the enzyme retained more than 95% of its activity after incubation for 30 min under these conditions.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

AB  == an amylopullulanase gene (aputs) from bacillus stearothermophilus ts-23 was cloned and characterized. aputs consisted of an open reading frame of 6054 bp encoding a protein of 2018 amino acids with a calculated m(r) of 223811. the deduced amino acid sequence revealed four highly conserved regions that are common among amylolytic enzymes. in the c-terminal region, a six-amino-acid sequence (pro-gly-ser-gly-thr-thr) is repeated nine times. it shared the highest  degree of homology with the amylopullulanase of bacillus sp. xal601. the enzyme also had moderate homology with amylopullulanases from thermophilic anaerobic bacteria. low levels of homology were observed between the aputs of b. stearothermophilus ts-23 and amylopullulanases of pyrococcus abyssi orsay, p. furiosus and bacillus sp. ksm1378. when the intact coding region of aputs was expressed in escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter, the product  was degenerate, as revealed by amylase activity staining after sds/page. the largest active polypeptide had an m(r) of about 220000, while the smallest one had an m(r) of about 105000. upstream of the aputs gene, a gene orfx was fortuitously cloned. the putative orfx protein was weakly related to the myosin heavy chain. it was predicted to contain a central, 179-residue-long, coiled-coil domain.

TI  == sequence analyses of a broad host-range plasmid containing ermt from a tylosin-resistant lactobacillus sp. isolated from swine feces.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria resistant to the macrolide antibiotics tylosin and erythromycin were isolated from the feces of swine. one of the strains, 121b, was initially identified by 16s rdna sequence analysis as an unknown lactobacillus sp. the strain was found to contain at least two plasmids, one of which was capable of replicating and providing erythromycin and tylosin resistance to bacillus subtilis, streptococcus gordonii, and escherichia coli. dna sequence analyses of the 4,232-bp plasmid, p121bs, identified one open reading frame encoding a methylase gene highly similar (> 98% amino acid identity, > 99% dna sequence identity) to the ermt gene from the lactobacillus reuteri plasmid pgt633. this is only the second ermt gene to be reported. p121bs also contains two additional open reading frames with significant amino acid similarities to replication proteins from lactobacillus and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == facilitation of bacteriophage lambda dna injection by inner membrane proteins of  the bacterial phosphoenol-pyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts).
AB  == infection of escherichia coli by bacteriophage lambda depends on two membrane protein complexes: (i) maltoporin (lamb) in the outer membrane for adsorption and (ii) the iic(man)-iid(man) complex of the mannose transporter in the inner membrane for dna penetration. iic(man) and iid(man) are components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) which together with the iiab(man) subunit mediate transport and phosphorylation of sugars. to identify structural determinants important for penetration of lambda dna, the homologous iic-iid complexes of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis, and chimeric complexes between the iic and iid were characterized. all three complexes support sugar transport in e. coli. only iic-iid of e. coli and b. subtilis also support bacteriophage lambda infection. the six chimeric complexes  had lost transport activity, but three containing iic of e. coli or b. subtilis continue to support bacteriophage lambda infection. complexes containing iic(man) and fusion proteins between truncated iid(man) and alkaline phosphatase or beta-galactosidase support penetration of lambda dna if less than 100 residues are missing from the c-terminus of iid(man). truncation of iic(man) renders the complex unstable. taken together, these results suggest, that iic is the major specificity determinant for lambda infection but that the iic subunit is stably expressed only in a complex with the iid subunit. lambda dna in transit across the periplasmic space, but not transforming plasmid dna, is inaccessible to the non-specific nuclease nuca of anabaena sp. targeted to the periplasmic space either in soluble form or as a fusion protein to the c-terminus of iid(man).

AB  == the gene that encodes a thermostable pectate lyase (called pl 47), from bacillus  sp. ts 47, was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in mesophilic b. subtilis. the gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 1326 bp, which encoded 441 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme (416 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47,262 da), showed 52% similarity with  pl (bspel) from mesophilic b. subtilis so113. the structure-based alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of pl 47 with that of bspel suggested that pl 47  might have a parallel beta-helix structure with three long loops. the amino acids making up pl 47 are richer in hydrophobic amino acids and glutamic acid than bspel. the hydropathy profile of pl 47 indicated that the amino acid sequences around putative calcium binding sites are more hydrophobic than the same region of bspel. the gene product expressed in b. subtilis as the host was stable up to  70 degrees c and the reaction was optimal around 70 degrees c, as well as native  pl 47.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

AB  == the gram-negative soil micro-organism myxobacter sp. al-1 possesses at least five extracellular cellulases, the production of which is regulated by the growth cycle. we cloned the complete gene for one of these cellulases, termed cel9, which encoded a 67-kda modular family 9 endoglycohydrolase, which was produced during the stationary phase of growth and was strongly enhanced by avicel. the predicted product of cel9 matches the structural architecture of family 9 cellulases such as thermonospora fusca endo/exocellulase e4. cel9 protein was synthesized in escherichia coli from a multicopy plasmid and in bacillus subtilis from the isopropyl thiogalactoside-inducible pspac promoter and was purified from the culture medium. thermal stability, optimum ph and temperature dependence of cel9 were similar when expressed from either source, and were indistinguishable from related cellulases produced by thermophilic bacteria. downstream from cel9 was found a partial orf, designated cel48, the deduced product of which was highly similar to bacterial exocellobiohydrolases and processive endoglucanases belonging to family 48 of the glycosyl hydrolases. the cel9 and cel48 genes appear to be arranged as part of an operon.

AB  == the predominant photolesion in the dna of uv-irradiated dormant bacterial spores  is the thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, commonly referred to as spore photoproduct (sp). a major determinant of sp repair during spore germination is its direct reversal by the enzyme sp lyase, encoded by the splb gene in bacillus  subtilis. splb protein containing an n-terminal tag of six histidine residues [(6his)splb] was purified from dormant b. subtilis spores and shown to efficiently cleave sp but not cyclobutane cis,syn thymine-thymine dimers in vitro. in contrast, splb protein containing an n-terminal 10-histidine tag [(10his)splb] purified from an escherichia coli overexpression system was incompetent to cleave sp unless the 10-his tag was first removed by proteolysis at an engineered factor xa site. to assay the parameters of binding of splb protein to uv-damaged dna, a 35-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide was constructed which carried a single pair of adjacent thymines on one strand. irradiation of the oligonucleotide in aqueous solution or at 10% relative humidity resulted in formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (py lozengepy) or sp, respectively. (10his)splb was assayed for oligonucleotide binding using a dnase i protection assay. in the presence of (10his)splb, the sp-containing oligonucleotide was selectively protected from dnase i digestion (half-life, >60  min), while the py lozengepy-containing oligonucleotide and the unirradiated oligonucleotide were rapidly digested by dnase i (half-lives, 6 and 9 min, respectively). dnase i footprinting of (10his)splb bound to the artificial substrate was carried out utilizing the (32)p end-labeled 35-bp oligonucleotide containing sp. dnase i footprinting showed that splb protected at least a 9-bp region surrounding sp from digestion with dnase i with the exception of two dnase i-hypersensitive sites within the protected region. (10his)splb also caused significant enhancement of dnase i digestion of the sp-containing oligonucleotide for at least a full helical turn 3' to the protected region. the data suggest that binding of sp lyase to sp causes significant bending or distortion of the dna helix in the vicinity of the lesion.

TI  == cloning and expression of the nitrile hydratase and amidase genes from bacillus sp. br449 into escherichia coli.
AB  == a moderate thermophile, bacillus sp. br449 was previously shown to exhibit a high level of nitrile hydratase (nhase) activity when growing on high levels of acrylonitrile at 55 degrees c. in this report, we describe the cloning of a 6.1 kb sali dna fragment encoding the nhase gene cluster of br449 into escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing revealed six orfs encoding (in order), two unidentified putative proteins, amidase, nhase beta- and alpha-subunits and a small putative protein of 101 amino acids designated p12k. spacings and orientation of the coding regions as well as their gene expression in e. coli suggest that the beta-subunit, alpha-subunit, and p12k genes are co-transcribed.  analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the amidase (348 aa, mw 38.6 kda) belongs to the nitrilase-related aliphatic amidase family, and that the nhase beta- (229 aa, mw 26.5 kda) and alpha- (214 aa, mw 24.5 kda) subunits comprise a cobalt-containing member of the nhase family, which includes rhodococcus rhodochrous j1 and pseudomonas putida 5b nhases. the amidase/nhase gene cluster differs both in arrangement and composition from those described for other nhase-producing strains. when expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, the subcloned nhase genes produced significant levels of active nhase enzyme when cobalt ion was added either to the culture medium or cell extracts. presence of the p12k gene and addition of amide compounds as inducers were not required for this expression.

TI  == subsite preferences of pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinases from prokaryotes: kumamolysin, a thermostable pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase.
AB  == kumamolysin, a carboxyl proteinase from bacillus novosp. mn-32, is characterized  by its thermostability and insensitivity to aspartic proteinase inhibitors such as pepstatin, diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methylester, and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitro-phenoxy)propane. here, its substrate specificity was elucidated using two series of synthetic chromogenic substrates: p(5)-p(4)-p(3)-p(2)-phe*nph (p-nitrophenylalanine: *cleavage site)-p(2)'-p(3)', in which the amino acid residues at the p(5)-p(2), p(2)' and p(3)' positions were systematically substituted. among 74 substrates, kumamolysin was shown to hydrolyze lys-pro-ile-pro-phe-nph-arg-leu most effectively. the kinetic parameters of this peptide were k(m) = 41+/-5 microm, k(cat) = 176+/- 10 s(-1), and k(cat)/k(m) = 4.3+/-0.6 mm(-1) x s(-1). these systematic analyses revealed the following features: (i) kumamolysin had a unique preference for the p(2) position. kumamolysin preferentially hydrolyzed peptides having an ala or pro residue at the p(2) position; this was also observed for the pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase from bacillus coagulans j-4 [j-4; shibata et al. (1998) j. biochem. 124, 642-647]. other carboxyl proteinases, including pseudomonas sp. 101 pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase (pcp) and xanthomonas sp. t-22 pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinase (xcp), preferred peptides having hydrophobic and bulky amino acid residue such as leu at the p(2)  position. (ii) kumamolysin preferred such charged amino acid residues as glu or arg at the p(2)' position, suggesting that the s(2)' subsite of kumamolysin is occupied by hydrophilic residues, similar to that of pcp, xcp, and j-4. in general, the s(2)' subsite of pepstatin-sensitive carboxyl proteinases (aspartic  proteinases) is hydrophobic in nature. thus, the hydrophilic nature of the s(2)'  subsite was confirmed to be a distinguishing feature of pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl proteinases from prokaryotes.

TI  == efficient secretory production of alkaline phosphatase by high cell density culture of recombinant escherichia coli using the bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal sequence.
AB  == new secretion vectors containing the bacillus sp. endoxylanase signal sequence were constructed for the secretory production of recombinant proteins in escherichia coli. the e. coli alkaline phosphatase structural gene fused to the endoxylanase signal sequence was expressed from the trc promoter in various e. coli strains by induction with iptg. among those tested, e. coli hb101 showed the highest efficiency of secretion (up to 25.3% of total proteins). when cells were  induced with 1 mm iptg, most of the secreted alkaline phosphatase formed inclusion bodies in the periplasm. however, alkaline phosphatase could be produced as a soluble form without reduction of expression level by inducing with less (0.01 mm) iptg, and greater than 90% of alkaline phosphatase could be recovered from the periplasm by the simple osmotic shock method. fed-batch cultures were carried out to examine the possibility of secretory protein production at high cell density. up to 5.2 g/l soluble alkaline phosphatase could be produced in the periplasm by the ph-stat fed-batch cultivation of e. coli hb101 harboring ptrcs1phoa. these results demonstrate the possibility of efficient secretory production of recombinant proteins in e. coli by high cell density cultivation.

TI  == esta, a gene coding for a cell-bound esterase from paenibacillus sp. bp-23, is a  new member of the bacterial subclass of type b carboxylesterases.
AB  == screening of a gene library from paenibacillus sp. bp-23 generated in escherichia coli led to identification of a clone that directed the production of lipolytic activity. from the sequencing data, we found an open reading frame encoding a protein of 485 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 53 kda and a pi of 5.1. absence of a signal peptide indicated that it was a cell-bound protein. sequence analysis showed that the protein contained the signature g-xi-s-x2-g included in most serine-esterases and lipases. the cloned protein showed high homology with enzymes belonging to the bacterial subclass of type b carboxylesterases. the enzyme had a significant preference for esters of short-chain fatty acids and showed the kinetics behaviour of a true esterase. maximum activity was found at ph 7.5 and 37 degrees c, although the enzyme was active in the ph range 6.0- 9.0 and at temperatures up to 45 degrees c. as expected for a serine-esterase, activity was inhibited by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride.

TI  == comp, a pilin-like protein essential for natural competence in acinetobacter sp.  strain bd413: regulation, modification, and cellular localization.
AB  == we recently identified a pilin-like competence factor, comp, which is essential for natural transformation of the gram-negative soil bacterium acinetobacter sp.  strain bd413. here we demonstrate that transcription and synthesis of the pilin-like competence factor comp are maximal in the late stationary growth phase, whereas competence is induced immediately after inoculation of a stationary-phase culture into fresh medium. western blot analyses revealed three  forms of comp, one with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kda, which correlates with the molecular mass deduced from the dna sequence, one 20-kda form, which was found to be glycosylated, and one 23-kda form. the glycosylation of comp was not  required for its function in dna binding and uptake. the 20-kda form was present  in the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasm, and the outer membrane, whereas the 23-kda form was located in the outer membrane and might be due to a further modification. immunological data suggest that comp is not a subunit of the pilus  structures. possible functions of comp in the dna transformation machinery of acinetobacter sp. strain bd413 are discussed.

TI  == comb, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. bd413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  == here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging orfs in acinetobacter sp.  bd413, namely lytb, orfy, orfx, comb, and orfz, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comc. the n-termini of the deduced proteins orfy and comb exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein comb is similar to type iv pilins. lytb is similar  to the escherichia coli lytb, which has been implicated in the stringent response. no homologues of orfx, orfy and orfz could be identified. a mutation in orfy or orfz led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comb resulted in a non-competent phenotype. disruption of lytb did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comb is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfy and orfz mutants were due to polar effects on comb and comc, respectively. analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comb mutant suggested that the competence gene comb is not essential for the biogenesis of type iv pili and expression of the type iv pili-associated property of twitching motility. transcriptional fusions between comb and a promoter-free lacz gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comb during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.

AB  == paenibacillus a11-2 can efficiently cleave two carbon&bond;sulfur bonds in dibenzothiophene (dbt) and alkyl dbts, which are refractory by conventional petroleum hydrodesulfurization, to remove sulfur atom at high temperatures. an 8.7-kb dna fragment containing the genes for the dbt desulfurizing enzymes of a11-2 was cloned in escherichia coli and characterized. heterologous expression analysis of the deletion mutants identified three open reading frames that were required for the desulfurization of dbt to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-hbp). the three genes were designated tdsa, tdsb, and tdsc (for thermophilic desulfurization). both the nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences show significant homology to dszabc genes of rhodococcus sp. igts8, but there are several local differences between them. subclone analysis revealed that the product of tdsc oxidizes dbt to dbt-5,5'-dioxide via dbt-5-oxide, the product of  tdsa converts dbt-5,5'-dioxide to 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzene sulfinate, and the  product of tdsb converts 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzene sulfinate to 2-hbp. cell-free extracts of a recombinant e. coli harboring all the three desulfurization genes converted dbt to 2-hbp at both 37 and 50 degrees c. in vivo and in vitro exhibition of desulfurization activity of the recombinant genes derived from a paenibacillus indicates that an e. coli oxidoreductase can be functionally coupled with the monooxygenases of a gram-positive thermophile.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

AB  == a thermostable aspartase gene (aspb) from bacillus sp. ym55-1 was cloned and the  gene sequenced. the aspb gene (1407 bp orf) encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 51 627 da, consisting of 468 amino-acid residues. an amino-acid sequence  comparison revealed that bacillus ym55-1 aspartase shared 71% homology with bacillus subtilis aspartase and 49% with escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens aspartases. the e. coli tk237/pucaspb strain, which was obtained by transforming e. coli tk237 (aspartase-null strain) with a vector plasmid (pucaspb) containing the cloned aspb gene, produced a large amount of the enzyme  corresponding to > 10% of the total soluble protein. the over-expressed recombinant enzyme (native molecular mass: 200 kda) was purified effectively and  rapidly using heat treatment and affinity chromatography. in order to probe the catalytic residues of this enzyme, two conserved amino-acid residues, lys183 and  his134, were individually mutated to alanine. although the tertiary structure of  each mutant was estimated to be the same as that of wild-type aspartase in cd and fluorescence measurements, the lys183ala mutant lost its activity completely, whereas his134ala retained full activity. this finding suggests that lys183 may be involved in the catalytic activity of this thermostable bacillus ym55-1 aspartase.

AB  == a novel dehydratase that catalyzes the stoichiometric dehydration of z-phenylacetaldoxime to phenylacetonitrile has been purified 483-fold to homogeneity from a cell-free extract of bacillus sp. strain oxb-1 isolated from soil. it has a m(r) of about 40 000 and is composed of a single polypeptide chain with a loosely bound protoheme ix. the enzyme is inactive unless fmn is added to  the assay, but low activity is also observed when sulfite replaces fmn. the activity in the presence of fmn is enhanced 5-fold under anaerobic conditions compared to the activity measured in air. the enzyme has maximum activity at ph 7.0 and 30 degrees c, and it is stable at up to 45 degrees c at around neutral ph. the aerobically measured activity in the presence of fmn is also enhanced by  fe(2+), sn(2+), so(3)(2)(-), and nan(3). metal-chelating reagents, carbonyl reagents, electron donors, and ferri- and ferrocyanides strongly inhibit the enzyme with k(i) values in the micromolar range. the enzyme is active with arylalkylaldoximes and to a lesser extent with alkylaldoximes. the enzyme prefers the z-form of phenylacetaldoxime over its e-isomer. on the basis of its substrate specificity, the enzyme has been tentatively named phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase. the gene coding for the enzyme was cloned into plasmid puc18, and a  1053 base-pair open reading frame that codes for 351 amino acid residues was identified as the oxd gene. a nitrilase, which participates in aldoxime metabolism in the organism, was found to be coded by the region just upstream from the oxd gene. in addition an open reading frame (orf2), whose gene product is similar to bacterial regulatory (dna-binding) proteins, was found just upstream from the coding region of the nitrilase. these findings provide genetic  evidence for a novel gene cluster that is responsible for aldoxime metabolism in  this microorganism.

AB  == human leptin is a 16 kda (146 amino acids) protein secreted from adipocytes and influences body weight homeostasis. in this study, human leptin was produced and  secreted efficiently in escherichia coli using a novel bacillus sp. endoxylanase  signal peptide. the endoxylanase signal sequence consisted of 28 amino acids (84  bp) was fused to the leptin structural gene. the fused gene was expressed using an inducible promoter (t7 or trc) by adding 1 mm iptg. using t7 promoter in e. coli bl21(de3), most of protein produced was in a premature form. using the trc promoter, which is weaker than t7, leptin was efficiently produced and secreted as a mature form (40% of total proteins) at 37 degrees c. however, most of leptin (about 90%) formed the inclusion bodies in the periplasmic space of e. coli. at 30 degrees c, ca. 90% of leptin was produced in a soluble form, but the total amount of leptin produced was 40% less than that obtained at 37 degrees c. when the periplasmic oxidoreductase of e. coli, dsba, was co-expressed, 69% of the secreted leptin (26% of total proteins) was produced as soluble form at 37 degrees c without the decrease of the amount of leptin produced.

TI  == calcium-mediated thermostability in the subtilisin superfamily: the crystal structure of bacillus ak.1 protease at 1.8 a resolution.
AB  == proteins of the subtilisin superfamily (subtilases) are widely distributed through many living species, where they perform a variety of processing functions. they are also used extensively in industry. in many of these enzymes,  bound calcium ions play a key role in protecting against autolysis and thermal denaturation. we have determined the crystal structure of a highly thermostable protease from bacillus sp. ak.1 that is strongly stabilized by calcium. the crystal structure, determined at 1.8 a resolution (r=0. 182, rfree=0.247), reveals the presence of four bound cations, three ca(2+) and one na(+). two of the ca(2+) binding sites, ca-1 and ca-2, correspond to sites also found in thermitase and the mesophilic subtilisins. the third calcium ion, however, is at  a novel site that is created by two key amino acid substitutions near ca-1, and has not been observed in any other subtilase. this site, acting cooperatively with ca-1, appears to give substantially enhanced thermostability, compared with  thermitase. comparisons with the mesophilic subtilisins also point to the importance of aromatic clusters, reduced hydrophobic surface and constrained n and c termini in enhancing the thermostability of thermitase and ak.1 protease. the ak.1 protease also contains an unusual cys-x-cys disulfide bridge that modifies the active site cleft geometry.

AB  == we examined codon usage in bacillus subtilis genes by multivariate analysis, quantified its cellular levels of individual trnas, and found a clear constraint  of trna contents on synonymous codon choice. individual trna levels were proportional to the copy number of the respective trna genes. this indicates that the trna gene copy number is an important factor to determine in cellular trna levels, which is common with escherichia coli and yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. codon usage in 18 unicellular organisms whose genomes have been sequenced completely was analyzed and compared with the composition of trna genes. the 18 organisms are as follows: yeast s. cerevisiae, aquifex aeolicus, archaeoglobus fulgidus, b. subtilis, borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia trachomatis, e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacterpylori, methanococcusjannaschii, methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, pyrococcus horikoshii, rickettsia prowazekii,  synechocystis sp., and treponema pallidum. codons preferred in highly expressed genes were related to the codons optimal for the translation process, which were  predicted by the composition of isoaccepting trna genes. genes with specific codon usage are discussed in connection with their evolutionary origins and functions. the origin and terminus of replication could be predicted on the basis of codon usage when the usage was analyzed relative to the transcription direction of individual genes.

TI  == porcine pulmonary surfactant preparations contain the antibacterial peptide prophenin and a c-terminal 18-residue fragment thereof.
AB  == surfactant preparations obtained from porcine lungs by extraction with chloroform/methanol followed by chromatography over lipidex-5000 are used for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. these preparations contain about 98% phospholipids and 1-2% of the hydrophobic pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins b and c (sp-b and sp-c). separation of the proteins in the surfactant preparation by reversed-phase high performance liquid  chromatography revealed, in addition to sp-b and sp-c, the presence of three peptides derived from the cathelicidin family of antibacterial peptides. the 79-residue proline-rich peptide prophenin (identical to that isolated from leukocytes), an 80-residue prophenin with an n-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue, and a c-terminal 18-residue fragment of prophenin were found in approximate molar ratios of 1:20:5. a synthetic version of the c-terminal 18-residue peptide exhibits salt-dependent antibacterial activity (higher activity in the absence of salt) against the gram-positive bacterium bacillus megaterium bm11 and, to a lesser extent, against gram-negative escherichia coli d21 cells. it appears possible that the presence of prophenin peptides may contribute to the antibacterial properties of surfactant preparations.

TI  == cold-adapted alanine dehydrogenases from two antarctic bacterial strains: gene cloning, protein characterization, and comparison with mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts.
AB  == the genes encoding nad(+)-dependent alanine dehydrogenases (aladhs) (ec 1.4.1.1)  from the antarctic bacterial organisms shewanella sp. strain ac10 (shealadh) and  carnobacterium sp. strain st2 (caraladh) were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. of all of the aladhs that have been sequenced, shealadh exhibited the highest level of sequence similarity to the aladh from the gram-negative bacterium vibrio proteolyticus (vpraladh). caraladh was most similar to aladhs from mesophilic and thermophilic bacillus strains. shealadh and caraladh had features typical of cold-adapted enzymes; both the optimal temperature for catalytic activity and the temperature limit for retaining thermostability were lower than the values obtained for the mesophilic counterparts. the k(cat)/k(m) value for the shealadh reaction was about three times higher than the k(cat)/k(m) value for vpraladh, but it was much lower than the k(cat)/k(m) value for the aladh from bacillus subtilis. homology-based structural models of various aladhs, including the two psychotropic aladhs, were constructed. the thermal instability  of shealadh and caraladh may result from relatively low numbers of salt bridges in these proteins.

TI  == a multidomain xylanase from a bacillus sp. with a region homologous to thermostabilizing domains of thermophilic enzymes.
AB  == the gene xync encoding xylanase c from bacillus sp. bp-23 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of a 3538 bp dna fragment  containing xync gene was determined, revealing an open reading frame of 3258 bp that encodes a protein of 120,567 da. a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of xylanase c with known beta-glycanase sequences showed that the encoded enzyme is a modular protein containing three different domains. the central region of the enzyme is the catalytic domain, which shows high homology to family 10 xylanases. a domain homologous to family ix cellulose-binding domains is located in the c-terminal region of xylanase c, whilst the n-terminal  region of the enzyme shows homology to thermostabilizing domains found in several thermophilic enzymes. xylanase c showed an activity profile similar to that of enzymes from mesophilic micro-organisms. maximum activity was found at 45 degrees c, and the enzyme was only stable at 55 degrees c lower temperatures. xylotetraose, xylotriose, xylobiose and xylose were the main products from birchwood xylan hydrolysis, whilst the enzyme showed increasing activity on xylo-oligosaccharides of increasing length, indicating that the cloned enzyme is  an endoxylanase. a deletion derivative of xylanase c, lacking the region homologous to thermostabilizing domains, was constructed. the truncated enzyme showed a lower optimum temperature for activity than the full-length enzyme, 35 degrees c instead of 45 degrees c, and a reduced thermal stability that resulted  in a complete inactivation of the enzyme after 2 h incubation at 55 degrees c.

AB  == a set of open reading frames (orfs) potentially encoding signal transduction proteins are clustered around icfg, a gene implicated in the regulation of carbon metabolism, in the genome of synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803. slr1860 is the orf for icfg, whose predicted product resembles the protein phosphatases spoiie,  rsbu, and rsbx from bacillus subtilis. bracketing slr1860/icfg are (i) orf slr1861, whose predicted product resembles the spoiiab, rsbt, and rsbw protein kinases from b. subtilis, and (ii) orfs slr1856 and slr1859, whose predicted products resemble the respective phosphoprotein substrates for the b. subtilis protein kinases: spoiiaa, rsbs, and rsbv. in order to determine whether the protein products encoded by these orfs possessed the functional capabilities suggested by sequence comparisons, each was expressed in escherichia coli as a histidine-tagged fusion protein and analyzed for its ability to participate in protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes in vitro. it was observed that orf slr1861 encoded an atp-dependent protein kinase capable of phosphorylating slr1856 and, albeit with noticeably lower efficiency, slr1859. site-directed mutagenesis suggests that slr1861 phosphorylated these proteins on  ser-54 and ser-57, respectively. slr1860 exhibited divalent metal ion-dependent protein-serine phosphatase activity. it catalyzed the dephosphorylation of slr1856, but not slr1859, in vitro.

TI  == establishing the independent culture of a strictly symbiotic bacterium symbiobacterium thermophilum from its supporting bacillus strain.
AB  == symbiobacterium thermophilum is a strictly symbiotic thermophile, the growth of which is dependent on the coexistence of an associating thermophilic bacillus sp., strain s. s. thermophilum grows only in mixed culture with the bacillus strain in liquid media, and does not form visible colonies on solid media. to measure the growth of this symbiotic bacterium and to analyze its growth requirements, we developed a quantitative pcr method by using its specific sequences in a putative membrane translocator gene tnat as primers. according to  this method, independent growth of s. thermophilum was first confirmed in a dialyzing culture physically separated from bacillus strain s with a cellulose membrane. independent growth of s. thermophilum was also managed by adding conditioned medium prepared from the culture filtrate of the bacillus strain, but the growth in the conditioned medium stopped at a very limited extent with appearance of filamentous cells, suggesting the uncoupling of cellular growth and cell division. formation of micro-colonies of s. thermophilum was observed on the conditioned agar medium under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but the colony-forming efficiencies remained below 1%. several other bacterial species, such as bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, thermus thermophilus, and even escherichia coli, were also found to support the growth of s. thermophilum.  these results indicate that s. thermophilum essentially requires some ubiquitous  metabolite(s) of low molecular weight produced by various bacterial species as growth factor(s) but coexistence of the living partner cells is still required, probably to maintain an effective level of the putative factor(s) in the medium.

AB  == bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas fluorescens, salmonella sp. and staphylococcus aureus were used to test the antimicrobial activity of tea flush extract and extracts of various tea products. among the six test organisms, p. fluorescens was the most sensitive to the extracts, while b. subtilis was the least sensitive. in general, antimicrobial activity decreased when the extents of tea fermentation increased. the antimicrobial activities of tea flush extract and extracts of tea products with different extents of fermentation varied with test organisms. tea flush and green tea, the unfermented tea, exerted the strongest antimicrobial activity followed by the partially fermented tea products such as longjing, tieh-kuan-ying, paochung, and oolong teas. on the other hand, black tea, the completely fermented tea, showed the least antimicrobial activity. it was also noted that extracts of oolong tea prepared in summer exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity, followed by those prepared in spring, winter and fall.

TI  == role of metal ions in the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by rnase p rna from bacillus subtilis.
AB  == precursor trna (ptrna) substrates carrying a single rp or sp-phosphorothioate modification at the rnase p cleavage site were used as tools to study the cleavage mechanism of rnase p rna from bacillus subtilis. both the sp and the rp-diastereomer reduced the rate of processing at least 10(4)-fold under conditions where the chemical step is essentially rate-limiting. neither the rp nor the sp-phosphorothioate modification affected ptrna ground state binding to b. subtilis rnase p rna. processing of the rp-diastereomeric ptrna could be restored in the presence of mn2+or cd2+, demonstrating direct metal ion coordination to the pro -rp oxygen during catalysis. with cd2+, processing required the presence of another metal ion, such as ca2+or mg2+, to mediate substrate binding. this is in contrast to escherichia coli rnase p rna, which promotes cleavage of rp-diastereomeric ptrna in the presence of cd2+as the sole divalent metal ion. analysis of [cd2+]-dependent processing of the rp-diastereomeric substrate by b. subtilis rnase p rna was consistent with the involvement of at least two metal ions in catalysis. the presence of two catalytic metal ion binding sites is also supported by the inhibition mode of ca2+on cleavage of unmodified ptrna. in the presence of an sp-phosphorothioate modification at the scissile bond, neither mn2+nor cd2+were able to restore significant cleavage at this location. instead, the ribozyme promotes cleavage at the neighboring unmodified phosphodiester with low efficiency. unaffected ground  state binding of the sp-diastereomeric ptrna but a >/=10(4)-fold reduced hydrolysis rate may indicate a crucial role of the pro -sp oxygen in transition state stabilization or may be attributed to steric exclusion of catalytic metal ions. based on our comparative analyses of b. subtilis and e. coli rnase p rna, each representing the main structural subtypes of bacterial rnase p rna, common features in terms of active site constraints and role of catalytic metal ions can now be formulated for bacterial rnase p rnas. on the other hand, substantial and  unexpected differences with respect to the overall metal ion requirements and trna binding modes have been observed for the two catalytic rnas.

TI  == putative mechanism of natural transformation as deduced from genome data.
AB  == genetic transformation is widely utilized in molecular biology as a tool for gene cloning in escherichia coli and for gene mapping in bacillus subtilis. several strains of eubacteria can naturally take up exogenous dna and integrate the dna into their own genomes. molecular details of natural transformation, however, remained to be elucidated. the complete genome of a cyanobacterium, synechocystis sp. pcc6803, has been sequenced. this bacterium has been used to examine functions of a particular gene. the genome is considered to carry information on  natural transformable characteristics of synechocystis. the first step in genetic transformation is the uptake of exogenous dna. proteins with non-specific dna binding features are required, because specificity in the exogenous dna has not been demonstrated. such proteins have modules interacting with the phosphate backbone of dna, including helix-turn-helix modules. using a consensus pattern of the phosphate-binding helix-turn-helix module, we searched through the genome data of synechocystis for genes or open reading frame (orf) products with the pattern in primary structures. we found that an orf, slr0197, has the pattern in  duplicate at the c-terminal region. we also found that the orf product has a hydrophobic segment at the n-terminal region, which is followed by two internal repeats of the endonuclease domain. based on these observations, we propose a model for the initial stage of genetic transformation. this is apparently the first report on molecular mechanisms of natural transformation.

TI  == monomeric sarcosine oxidase: structure of a covalently flavinylated amine oxidizing enzyme.
AB  == background: monomeric sarcosine oxidases (msoxs) are among the simplest members of a recently recognized family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes that catalyze similar oxidative reactions with various secondary or tertiary amino acids and contain covalently bound flavins. other members of this family include  heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase, n-methyltryptophan oxidase and pipecolate oxidase. mammalian sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase may  be more distantly related family members. results: the x-ray crystal structure of msox from bacillus sp. b-0618, expressed in escherichia coli, has been solved at  2.0 a resolution by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (mad) from crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme. fourteen selenium sites, belonging to two msox molecules in the asymmetric unit, were used for mad phasing and to define the local twofold symmetry axis for electron-density averaging. the structures of the native enzyme and of two enzyme-inhibitor complexes were also determined. conclusions: msox is a two-domain protein with an overall topology most similar to that of d-amino acid oxidase, with which it shares 14% sequence identity. the flavin ring is located in a very basic environment, making contact  with sidechains of arginine, lysine, histidine and the n-terminal end of a helix  dipole. the flavin is covalently attached through an 8alpha-s-cysteinyl linkage to cys315 of the catalytic domain. covalent attachment is probably self-catalyzed through interactions with the positive sidechains and the helix dipole. substrate binding is probably stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the substrate carboxylate and two basic sidechains, arg52 and lys348, located above the re face of the flavin ring.

TI  == the physiological contribution of acinetobacter pcak, a transport system that acts upon protocatechuate, can be masked by the overlapping specificity of vank.
AB  == vank is the fourth member of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with pcak, benk, and muck, contributes to aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter sp. strain adp1. vank and pcak have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype  associated with inactivation of its homolog. furthermore, vank pcak double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound quinate, although such cells on plates convert quinate to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. this provides genetic evidence that quinate is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and is in line with the early argument that quinate catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. previous studies of aromatic catabolism in acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the beta-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. by using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. in this study, the overlapping specificity of the vank and pcak permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vank or pcak. spontaneous mutations identified in vank include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a g6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of vank structure and function. preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated pcr mutagenesis in one vank mutant gave results similar to those using lacy, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action. the selection for transport mutants described here for acinetobacter may also be applicable to pseudomonas putida, where the pcak permease has an additional role in chemotaxis.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pip823 from listeria monocytogenes bm4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pip823, which contains the dfrd gene; dfrd confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to listeria monocytogenes bm4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type s2. pip823 possessed all the features of the pub110/pc194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. the rep gene encoded a protein identical to repu, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids ptb913 from a thermophilic bacillus sp. and pub110 from staphylococcus aureus. the mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity  with the mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of ptb913 and pub110. the host range of pip823 was broad and included l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. in all these species, pip823 replicated by generating single-stranded dna and was stable. conjugative mobilization of pip823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis,  between l. monocytogenes and e. coli, and between strains of e. coli, and by the  streptococcal conjugative transposon tn1545 from l. monocytogenes to e. faecalis, and from l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis to e. coli. these data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.

TI  == structure of the flavocoenzyme of two homologous amine oxidases: monomeric sarcosine oxidase and n-methyltryptophan oxidase.
AB  == monomeric sarcosine oxidase (msox) and n-methyltryptophan oxidase (mtox) are homologous enzymes that catalyze the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine (n-methylglycine) and n-methyl-l-tryptophan, respectively. msox is induced in various bacteria upon growth on sarcosine. mtox is an e. coli enzyme of unknown metabolic function. both enzymes contain covalently bound flavin. the covalent flavin is at the fad level as judged by electrospray mass spectrometry. the data  provide the first evidence that mtox is a flavoprotein. the following observations indicate that 8alpha-(s-cysteinyl)fad is the covalent flavin in msox from bacillus sp. b-0618 and mtox. fmn-containing peptides, prepared by digestion of msox or mtox with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and phosphodiesterase, exhibited absorption and fluorescence properties characteristic of an 8alpha-(s-cysteinyl)flavin and could be bound to apo-flavodoxin. the thioether link in the fmn-containing peptides was converted to the sulfone by performic acid oxidation, as judged by characteristic absorbance changes and an increase in flavin fluorescence. the sulfone underwent a predicted reductive cleavage reaction upon treatment with dithionite, releasing unmodified fmn. cys315 was identified as the covalent fad attachment site in msox from b. sp. b-0618, as judged by the sequence obtained for a flavin-containing tryptic peptide (gavcmyt). cys315 aligns with a conserved cysteine in msox from other bacteria, mtox (cys308) and pipecolate oxidase, a homologous mammalian enzyme known to contain covalently bound flavin. there is only one conserved cysteine found among these enzymes, suggesting that cys308 is the covalent flavin attachment site in mtox.

AB  == inspection of the genomes for the bacteria bacillus subtilis 168, borrelia burgdorferi b31, escherichia coli k-12, haemophilus influenzae kw20, helicobacter pylori 26695, mycoplasma genitalium g-37, and synechocystis sp pcc 6803 and for the archaeons archaeoglobus fulgidus vc-16 dsm4304, methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta h, and methanococcus jannaschii dsm2661 revealed that each contains at least one orf whose predicted product displays sequence features characteristic of eukaryote-like protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases and protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphatases. orthologs for all four major protein phosphatase families (ppp, ppm, conventional ptp, and low molecular weight ptp) were present in the bacteria surveyed, but not all strains contained  all types. the three archaeons surveyed lacked recognizable homologs of the ppm family of eukaryotic protein-serine/threonine phosphatases; and only two prokaryotes were found to contain orfs for potential phosphatases from all four major families. intriguingly, our searches revealed a potential ancestral link between the catalytic subunits of microbial arsenate reductases and the protein-tyrosine phosphatases; they share similar ligands (arsenate versus phosphate) and features of their catalytic mechanism (formation of arseno-versus  phospho-cysteinyl intermediates). it appears that all prokaryotic organisms, at one time, contained the genetic information necessary to construct protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation networks that target serine, threonine, and/or  tyrosine residues on proteins. however, the potential for functional redundancy among the four protein phosphatase families has led many prokaryotic organisms to discard one, two, or three of the four.

TI  == bacterial infection and endotoxin in female reproductive tract in rats: correlation with the developmental status of preimplantation embryos.
AB  == during mammalian preimplantation development, a substantial numbers of embryos are believed to be lost for reasons that are unclear. using female rats, we investigated whether the developmental status of embryos is influenced by bacterial infection and endotoxin in the reproductive tract. from the vagina of cycling rats (n = 11), 21 bacterial isolates were identified; they were streptococcus faecalis (s. faecalis; 38%), escherichia coli (e. coli; 19%), acinetobactor calcoaceticus (a. calcoaceticus; 14%), and coagulase negative staphylococcus (14%), micrococcus sp. (5%), bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis; 5%) and proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris; 5%). from the vagina of day 4 pregnant rats (n = 12), 26 isolates were identified; they were s. faecalis (23%), a. calcoaceticus (23%), e. coli (15%), micrococcus sp. (15%), b. subtilis (8%), p. vulgaris (4%),  staphylococcus aureus (4%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%). gram negative bacteria found in the vagina of cycling and day 4  pregnant rats were 38% and 46%, respectively. in both, bacterial load was 10(3)-10(5) colony forming units and there was no association with the abnormality of the recovered embryos. however, in two day 4 pregnant animals, pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus) were isolated and embryos recovered from them were degenerated and deformed. the vagina of day 9 pregnant animals (n = 7) were, however, sterile. consistently, in all animals, the upper reproductive tract (uterus and oviduct) was devoid of any  bacteria and no anaerobic bacteria were isolated from any part of the tract. the  levels of endotoxin in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 1.35 +/- 0.1 and 1.17 +/- 0.1 endotoxin units (eu), respectively. it was undetectable  in the oviduct and uterus of all animals (n = 5) except one which showed high levels of endotoxin in uterus (4.5 eu) and oviduct (2.2 eu) and the animal also produced degenerated and deformed embryos. these results indicate that common bacterial flora of vagina may not affect embryo development and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina and/or endotoxin in reproductive tract could be detrimental to viability of gametes and preimplantation embryos in rats.

AB  == the rpoa gene, encoding the alpha subunit of rna polymerase, was isolated from alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain c-125 by the pcr method. a 3-kb hindiii fragment containing the complete rpoa gene was cloned and sequenced. the alpha subunit gene was found to encode a protein consisting of 314 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 34,805 da. compared with the amino acid sequences of other known eubacterial rna polymerase alpha subunits, the gene has 84% identity to that of b. subtilis, while showing 48% and 47% identity to that of streptomyces coelicolor and escherichia coli, respectively. six conserved regions, which are observed in the case of other eubacteria, were found in the rna polymerase alpha  subunit of this strain. five of them are located in the n-terminal domain involved in assembly of the core enzyme, while one is located in the c-terminal domain, which interacts with several transcriptional factors and a specific dna element. by means of recombinant plasmids, a hexahistidine-tagged derivative of the rna polymerase alpha subunit of strain c-125 and two deletion derivatives (c- and n-terminal domains) of this protein were overexpressed in e. coli cells and purified to near homogeneity.

TI  == molecular cloning of two genes for beta-d-glucosidase in bacillus sp. gl1 and identification of one as a gellan-degrading enzyme.
AB  == in the bacterium bacillus sp. gl1, gellan is depolymerized to give a tetrasaccharide by extracellular gellan lyase and then the tetrasaccharide is converted to constituent monosaccharides by intracellular glycosidases. two genes encoding one of the glycosidases, beta-d-glucosidase (bgl), were cloned in a genomic dna library of the bacterium constructed in escherichia coli and nucleotide sequences of the genes were determined. one of the genes, termed bgla, contained an open reading frame (orf) consisting of 1344 base pairs coding a polypeptide (bgla) with a molecular mass of 51 kda and the other, termed bglb, 2268 base pairs coding a protein (bglb) with a molecular mass of 82 kda. by homology analyses of the orfs against protein sequence databases, beta-d-glucosidase a (bgla) and beta-d-glucosidase b (bglb) were found to be classified into subfamilies bga and bgb of cellulase family bg, respectively. bgla and bglb purified from e. coli were monomeric enzymes with molecular masses  of 50 and 82 kda and most active at ph 6.0 and 8.0, respectively. bgla showed broader substrate specificity than bglb. only bgla acted on the tetrasaccharide produced from gellan by gellan lyase and released glucose from the molecule.

AB  == the replication region of a 100-kb desulfurization plasmid (psox) from rhodococcus sp. strain x309 was localized to a 4-kb kpni fragment, and its sequence was determined. the amino acid sequence of one of the predicted open reading frames (orfs) was related to the putative replication (rep) protein sequences of the mycobacterial plr7 family of plasmids. three of the five predicted orf products were identified by radiolabelling with the escherichia coli t7 polymerase/promoter system. in e. coli, the rep protein of psox was apparently synthesized in a shortened form, 21.3 kda instead of the predicted 41.3 kda, as a result of an internal initiation. this situation is reminescent of that for some bacterial rep proteins. a shuttle plasmid was constructed with the  psox origin, pbluescript ii ks-, and the chloramphenicol resistance (cmr) gene from prf29. this new shuttle plasmid was used to demonstrate expression of the bacillus subtilis sacb gene in a strain of rhodococcus, rendering it sensitive to the presence of sucrose.

TI  == mutations in bartonella bacilliformis gyrb confer resistance to coumermycin a1.
AB  == this study describes the first isolation and characterization of spontaneous mutants conferring natural resistance to an antibiotic for any bartonella species. the bartonella bacilliformis gyrb gene, which encodes the b subunit of dna gyrase, was cloned and sequenced. the gyrb open reading frame (orf) is 2,079  bp and encodes a deduced amino acid sequence of 692 residues, corresponding to a  predicted protein of approximately 77.5 kda. sequence alignment indicates that b. bacilliformis gyrb is most similar to the gyrb protein from bacillus subtilis (40.1% amino acid sequence identity) and that it contains the longest n-terminal  tail (52 residues) of any gyrb characterized to date. the cloned b. bacilliformis gyrb was expressed in an escherichia coli s30 cell extract and was able to functionally complement a temperature-sensitive e. coli cour gyrb mutant (strain  n4177). we isolated and characterized spontaneous mutants of b. bacilliformis resistant to coumermycin a1, an antibiotic that targets gyrb. sequence analysis of gyrb from 12 cour mutants of b. bacilliformis identified single nucleotide transitions at three separate loci in the orf. the predicted amino acid substitutions resulting from these transitions are gly to ser at position 124 (gly124-->ser), arg184-->gln, and thr214-->ala or thr214-->ile, which are analogous to mutated residues found in previously characterized resistant gyrb genes from borrelia burgdorferi, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and haloferax sp. the cour mutants are three to five times more resistant to coumermycin a1 than the wild-type parental strain.

TI  == a five-nucleotide sequence protects dna from exonucleolytic degradation by addab, the recbcd analogue of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == homologous recombination in bacillus subtilis requires the product of the adda and addb genes, the addab enzyme. this enzyme, which is both a helicase and a powerful nuclease, is thought to be the counterpart of the escherichia coli recbcd enzyme. from this analogy, it is expected that the nuclease activity of addab can be downregulated by a specific dna sequence, which would correspond to  the chi site in e. coli. using protection of linear double-stranded dna as a criterion, we identified the five-nucleotide sequence 5'-agcgg-3', or its complement 5'-ccgct-3', as being sufficient for addab nuclease attenuation. we have shown further that this attenuation occurs only if the sequence is properly  oriented with respect to the translocating addab enzyme. finally, inspection of the complete b. subtilis genome revealed that this five-nucleotide sequence is over-represented and is, in a majority of cases, co-oriented with dna replication. based on these observations, we propose that 5'-agcgg-3', or its complement, is the b. subtilis analogue of the e. coli chi sequence.

TI  == universal ribotyping method using a chemically labelled oligonucleotide probe mixture.
AB  == some of the present problems in ribotyping are associated with a lack of uniform  reactivity of probes when bacterial dnas are of phylogenetically diverse origins. to overcome these problems, a set of five oligonucleotides (referred to as oligomix5) was selected to react with conserved sequences located near both extremities of rrs (16s rrna gene) and near both extremities and the middle of rrl (23s rrna gene). dna samples from 13 bacterial species selected to represent  various phylogenetic branches within the eubacteria were cleaved by a restriction endonuclease and electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose, and the fragments were vacuum-transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with digoxigenin-labelled oligomix5, plasmid dna from pkk3535 (cloned rrn operon from escherichia coli) or  pba2 (cloned rrs from bacillus subtilis), or acetylamino-fluorene-labelled e. coli 16 + 23s rrna. the results showed oligomix5 to visualize patterns in dna from phylogenetically diverse bacteria with comparable intensity. banding patterns (not band intensity) obtained with oligomix5 were identical with those obtained with 16 + 23s rrna or plasmid pkk3535 for each strain studied and represented complete ribotypes. for dna from gram-positive bacteria, complete ribotypes were observed after prolonged enzymatic detection of bands when probes  were either e. coli 16 + 23s rrna or pkk3535. patterns given by plasmid pba2 were subsets of the complete ribotypes for 9/13 strains. each oligonucleotide of the oligomix5 set was used as a probe to determine its contribution to the complete ribotype. the five oligonucleotide probes, used individually, visualized one to four patterns per dna sample. use of dna from xenorhabdus sp. cip 105189 cleaved  by ecori is suggested to control the quality of the oligonucleotide probes composing oligomix5. probe oligomix5 was found to be an essential tool for ribotyping phylogenetically diverse eubacteria.

TI  == spore photoproduct lyase from bacillus subtilis spores is a novel iron-sulfur dna repair enzyme which shares features with proteins such as class iii anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases and pyruvate-formate lyases.
AB  == the major photoproduct in uv-irradiated spore dna is the unique thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, commonly referred to as spore photoproduct (sp). an important determinant of the high uv resistance of bacillus subtilis spores is the accurate in situ reversal of sp during spore germination by the dna repair enzyme sp lyase. to study the molecular aspects of sp lyase-mediated sp repair, the cloned b. subtilis splb gene was engineered to encode sp lyase with a molecular tag of six histidine residues at its amino terminus. the engineered six-his-tagged sp lyase expressed from the amye locus restored uv resistance to spores of a uv-sensitive mutant b. subtilis strain carrying a deletion-insertion  mutation which removed the entire splab operon at its natural locus and was shown to repair sp in vivo during spore germination. the engineered sp lyase was purified both from dormant b. subtilis spores and from an escherichia coli overexpression system by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (nta) agarose affinity chromatography and was shown by western blotting, uv-visible spectroscopy, and iron and acid-labile sulfide analysis to be a 41-kda iron-sulfur (fe-s) protein,  consistent with its amino acid sequence homology to the 4fe-4s clusters in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases and pyruvate-formate lyases. sp lyase was capable of reversing sp from purified sp-containing dna in an in vitro reaction either when present in a cell-free extract prepared from dormant spores or after  purification on nickel-nta agarose. sp lyase activity was dependent upon reducing conditions and addition of s-adenosylmethionine as a cofactor.

TI  == a 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase catalyzing the formation of 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate in an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis.
AB  == several eubacteria including esherichia coli use an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate instead of the ubiquitous mevalonate pathway. in the alternative pathway, 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol or its 4-phosphate, which is proposed to be formed from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate via intramolecular rearrangement followed by reduction process, is one of the biosynthetic precursors of isopentenyl diphosphate. to clone the gene(s) responsible for synthesis of 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate, we prepared and selected e. coli mutants with an obligatory requirement for 2-c-methylerythritol  for growth and survival. all the dna fragments that complemented the defect in synthesizing 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate of these mutants contained the yaem gene, which is located at 4.2 min on the chromosomal map of e. coli. the gene product showed significant homologies to hypothetical proteins with unknown  functions present in haemophilus influenzae, synechocystis sp. pcc6803, mycobacterium tuberculosis, helicobacter pyroli, and bacillus subtilis. the purified recombinant yaem gene product was overexpressed in e. coli and found to  catalyze the formation of 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate in the presence of nadph. replacement of nadph with nadh decreased the reaction rate to about 1% of the original rate. the enzyme required mn2+, co2+, or mg2+ as well. these data clearly show that the yaem gene encodes an enzyme, designated 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, that synthesizes 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate, in a single step by intramolecular rearrangement  and reduction and that this gene is responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis in e.  coli.

TI  == the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors: role and regulation.
AB  == alternative sigma factors provide a means of regulating gene expression in response to various extracellular changes. one such class of sigma factors appears to control a variety of functions, including expression of heat-shock genes in escherichia coli, biosynthesis of alginates and carotenoids in pseudomonas aeruginosa and myxococcus xanthus, respectively, iron uptake in e. coli and pseudomonas spp., nickel and cobalt efflux in alcaligenes europhus, plant pathogenicity in pseudomonas syringae and synthesis of outer membrane proteins in photobacterium sp. strain ss9. most of these activities deal with extracytoplasmic functions, and such sigmas have been designated as ecf sigma factors. they have also been characterized in mycobacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria such as streptomyces coelicolor and bacillus subtilus and  the archaea sulpholobus acidocaldarius. ecf factors belong to a subfamily of the  sigma 70 class, based on their sequence conservation and function across bacterial species. the promoter consensus sequences recognized by the ecf factors are also highly conserved. in most of the cases, the activity of these factors is modulated by a cognate inner membrane protein that has been shown, both in e. coli and in p. aeruginosa, to act as an anti-sigma activity. this inner membrane  protein is presumed to serve as a sensor and signalling molecule, allowing an adaptive response to specific environmental change. presumably, an on-and-off switch of the anti-sigma activity leads to the release of the sigma factor and thereby to the co-ordinate transcription of the specific regulon it governs.

AB  == a gene encoding an endoxylanase of bacillus sp. was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the entire nucleotide sequence of a 1,620 bp smai fragment containing the endoxylanase gene was determined. the endoxylanase gene was 639 bp long and encoded 213 amino acids which showed up to 96% amino acid homology with  other endoxylanases. the endoxylanase produced by e. coli harboring pkjx4 was purified by ion-exchange chromatography (de-52 and cm-52) and its n-terminal sequence was determined to be ala-gly-thr-asp-tyr-trp-gln-asn-trp-thr-asp-gly-gly-gly-thr. the endoxylanase expressed in e. coli was identical to that of the original bacillus sp. whose molecular weight was approximately 20,400. most of the produced endoxylanase was  localized in the periplasmic space of e. coli. when the endoxylanase was reacted  with 2% oat spelts xylan (w/v) at 40 degrees c for 10 h, the major product was xylobiose which is known to be a selective growth stimulant to one of the healthy intestinal microflora, bifidobacteria.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == structure of the beta-galactosidase gene from thermus sp. strain t2: expression in escherichia coli and purification in a single step of an active fusion protein.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of both the bgaa gene, coding for a thermostable beta-galactosidase of thermus sp. strain t2, and its flanking regions was determined. the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme predicts a polypeptide  of 645 amino acids (mr, 73,595). comparative analysis of the open reading frames  located in the flanking regions of the bgaa gene revealed that they might encode  proteins involved in the transport and hydrolysis of sugars. the observed homology between the deduced amino acid sequences of bgaa and the beta-galactosidase of bacillus stearothermophilus allows us to classify the new enzyme within family 42 of glycosyl hydrolases. bgaa was overexpressed in its active form in escherichia coli, but more interestingly, an active chimeric beta-galactosidase was constructed by fusing the bgaa protein to the choline-binding domain of the major pneumococcal autolysin. this chimera illustrates a novel approach for producing an active and thermostable hybrid enzyme that can be purified in a single step by affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose, retaining the catalytic properties of the native enzyme. the chimeric enzyme showed a specific activity of 191,000 u/mg at 70 degrees c and a  km value of 1.6 mm with o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate, and it retained 50% of its initial activity after 1 h of incubation at 70 degrees c.

AB  == the gene encoding cyclomaltodextrinase (cdase) was cloned from alkalophilic bacillus sp. i-5. the nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined and the physicochemical properties of the enzyme were investigated. the gene had an open  reading frame of 559 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 64,884. the enzyme was purified to near homogeneity from escherichia coli cells carrying a recombinant plasmid that contained the cdase gene. the enzyme hydrolyzed cyclomaltoheptaose (beta-cd) 13 times better than starch and 33 times better than pullulan, and it had transglycosylation activity. the enzyme also hydrolyzed acarbose, a pseudotetrasaccharide inhibitor of glucosidases. the enzyme was stabilized by ca2+ and the activity was increased more than twofold in the presence of 5 mm edta. the optimum temperature of the enzyme was elevated from 40 to 50 degrees c by ca2+ ion and the thermal activity was maintained more than 80% at 60 degrees c in the presence of ca2+. comparison of known amino acid sequences of several amylolytic enzymes with cyclomaltodextrinase activity, site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme, and substrate specificity of the enzyme imply that the region between the third and the fourth conserved regions of the enzyme may play  an important role in binding and degradation of cyclomaltodextrin.

TI  == strand compositional asymmetry in bacterial and large viral genomes.
AB  == several bacterial genomes exhibit preference for g over c on the dna leading strand extending from the origin of replication to the ter-region in the genomes  of escherichia coli, mycoplasma genitalium, bacillus subtilis, and marginally in  haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and helicobacter pylori. strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of methanococcus jannaschii, methanobacterium  thermoautotrophicum, and archaeoglobus fulgidus. a strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in beta-type but not alpha- or gamma-type human herpesviruses featuring g > c downstream of oril and c > g upstream of oril. dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single or context-dependent base mutational rates. the absence of strand asymmetry in the archaeal genomes may reflect the presence of multiple origins of replication.

TI  == unique organization of the dnaa region from prochlorococcus marinus ccmp1375, a marine cyanobacterium.
AB  == in order to study dna replication control elements in cyanobacteria we cloned and sequenced the dnaa gene from the marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus marinus. the dnaa gene is ubiquitous among bacteria and encodes the dna replication initiation factor dnaa. the deduced amino acid sequence of the p. marinus dnaa protein shows highest similarity to the dnaa protein from the freshwater cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc6803. using a solid-phase dna binding assay we demonstrated that both cyanobacterial dnaa proteins specifically recognize chromosomal origins, oric, of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis in vitro. the genetic environment of dnaa is not conserved between the two cyanobacteria. upstream of the p. marinus dnaa gene we identified a gene encoding a putative atp-binding cassette (abc) transport protein. the gor gene encoding glutathione reductase lies downstream of dnaa. comparison of the genetic structure of dnaa regions from 15 representative bacteria shows that the pattern of genes flanking  dnaa is not universally conserved among them.

TI  == microbial production of hydrogen: an overview.
AB  == production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. anaerobic clostridia are  potential producers and immobilized c. butyricum produces 2 mol h2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. spontaneous production of h2 from formate and glucose by immobilized escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. enterobactericiae produces h2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). immobilized aerobic bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol h2/mol glucose. photosynthetic rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of h2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. excellent productivity (6.2 mol h2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (hup) mutant of r. capsulata on cellulose was found. cyanobacteria, viz., anabaena, synechococcus, and oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of h2. immobilized a. cylindrica produces h2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year.  increased h2 productivity was found for hup mutant of a. variabilis. synechococcus sp. has a high potential for h2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and h2 by klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. the fate of h2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future.

AB  == an i-ceui-noti-sfii endonuclease map of the bacillus subtilis 166 genome was constructed. it was almost identical to that of b. subtilis 168 except for the inversion of an approximately 1900 kb dna segment, the translocation of an approximately 100 kb segment and the duplication of a 5 kb segment. continuity of the inverted segment was investigated by direct measurement of the distances between the two genomic loci where i-scei recognition sites were created in the 168 and the 166 genomes. size difference of the i-scei fragments between the two  strains fully demonstrated the inversion of an approximately 1900 kb long 'continuous' dna segment and the 'location' of the two inversion junctions in the genome. the 100 kb dna segment including the lysogenic sp beta prophage was translocated close to one of the inversion junctions and was probably associated  with the duplication of a 5 kb segment. these rearrangements are consistent with  those indicated by genetic analyses.

AB  == a new substrate analogue, (2r)-1,2-dipalmitoyloxypropanethiophospho-1-d-myo-inositol (dpspi), has been used in a new, continuous assay for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc). dpspi is superior to other substrate analogs that have been used for assaying pi-plc since it is synthesized as a pure diastereomer and maintains both acyl chains of the natural substrate, dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol (dppi). the assay that has been developed using this new analogue has allowed us to elucidate detailed kinetic data so far lacking in the field. in addition, several mutants of pi-plc were constructed and assayed. the results show that arg-69 is essential for catalysis, since mutations at this position led to a 10(3)- 10(4)-fold decrease in activity with respect that of to the wild-type (wt) enzyme. an alanine mutant of asp-67, a residue also found at the active site, displays activity similar to that of wt. we have also used nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) and circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy to analyze the structural integrity and conformational stability of the mutants. the results show that the  overall global conformation of the enzyme is not perturbed by the mutants. the 15n-1h hsqc nmr spectrum of wt pi-plc is also reported at 600 mhz. the stereoselectivity of the reaction toward the stereoisomers of another analogue, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophospho-1-myo-inositol (dppsi), was used to probe whether arg-69 interacts with the phosphate moiety of the substrate. we have calculated that the wt enzyme shows a stereoselectivity ratio of 160000:1 in favor of the rp isomer versus the sp isomer. the r69k mutant displayed a significant 10(4)-fold relaxation of stereoselectivity. our data support the role of arg-69 in stabilizing the negative charge on the pentacoordinate phosphate in  the transition state during catalysis.

AB  == on a 4.7-kbp hindiii clone of thermus strain zo5 dna, complementing an aspartate  carbamoyltransferase mutation in escherichia coli, we identified a cluster of four potential open reading frames corresponding to genes pyrr, and pyrb, an unidentified open reading frame named bbc, and gene pyrc. the transcription initiation site was mapped at about 115 nucleotides upstream of the pyrr translation start codon. the cognate thermus pyr promoter also functions in heterologous expression of thermus pyr genes in e. coli. in thermus strain zo5, pyrb and pyrc gene expression is repressed three- to fourfold by uracil and increased twofold by arginine. based on the occurrence of several transcription signals in the thermus pyr promoter region and strong amino acid sequence identities (about 60%) between thermus pyrr and the pyrr attenuation proteins of  two bacillus sp., we propose a regulatory mechanism involving transcriptional attenuation to control pyr gene expression in thermus. in contrast to pyr attenuation in bacillus spp., however, control of the thermus pyr gene cluster would not involve an antiterminator structure but would involve a translating ribosome for preventing formation of the terminator rna hairpin. the deduced amino acid sequence of thermus strain zo5 aspartate carbamoyltransferase (atcase; encoded by pyrb) exhibits the highest similarities (about 50% identical amino acids) with atcases from pseudomonas sp. for thermus strain zo5 dihydroorotase (dhoase; encoded by pyrc), the highest similarity scores (about 40% identity) were obtained with dhoases from b. caldolyticus and bacillus subtilis. the enzyme properties of atcase expressed from truncated versions of the thermus pyr gene cluster in e. coli suggest that thermus atcase is stabilized by dhoase and that the translation product of bbc plays a role in feedback inhibition of the atcase-dhoase complex.

TI  == three bacillus cereus bacteriophage endolysins are unrelated but reveal high homology to cell wall hydrolases from different bacilli.
AB  == the ply genes encoding the endolysin proteins from bacillus cereus phages bastille, tp21, and 12826 were identified, cloned, and sequenced. the endolysins  could be overproduced in escherichia coli (up to 20% of total cellular protein),  and the recombinant proteins were purified by a two-step chromatographical procedure. all three enzymes induced rapid and specific lysis of viable cells of  several bacillus species, with highest activity on b. cereus and b. thuringiensis. ply12 and ply21 were experimentally shown to be n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases (ec 3.5.1.28). no apparent holin genes were found adjacent to the ply genes. however, ply21 may be endowed with a signal peptide which could play a role in timing of cell lysis by the cytoplasmic phage  endolysin. the individual lytic enzymes (plyba, 41.1 kda; ply21, 29.5 kda, ply12, 27.7 kda) show remarkable heterogeneity, i.e., their amino acid sequences reveal  only little homology. the n-terminal part of ply21 was found to be almost identical to the catalytic domains of a bacillus sp. cell wall hydrolase (cwlsp)  and an autolysin of b. subtilis (cwla). the c terminus of plyba contains a 77-amino-acid sequence repeat which is also homologous to the binding domain of cwlsp. ply12 shows homology to the major autolysins from b. subtilis and e. coli. comparison with database sequences indicated a modular organization of the phage  lysis proteins where the enzymatic activity is located in the n-terminal region and the c-termini are responsible for specific recognition and binding of bacillus peptidoglycan. we speculate that the close relationship of the phage enzymes and cell wall autolysins is based upon horizontal gene transfer among different bacillus phages and their hosts.

TI  == structure-function relationships within the peptide deformylase family. evidence  for a conserved architecture of the active site involving three conserved motifs  and a metal ion.
AB  == thermus thermophilus peptide deformylase was characterized. its enzymatic properties as well as its organization in domains proved to share close resemblances with those of the escherichia coli enzyme despite few sequence identities. in addition to the hexxh signature sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family, a second short stretch of strictly conserved amino acids  was noticed, egcls, the cysteine of which corresponds to the third zinc ligand. the study of site-directed mutants of the e. coli deformylase shows that the residues of this stretch are crucial for the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. both aforementioned sequences were used as markers of the peptide deformylase family in protein sequence databases. seven sequences coming from haemophilus influenzae, lactococcus lactis, bacillus stearothermophilus, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, bacillus subtilus and synechocystis sp. could be identified. the characterization of the product of the open reading frame from b. stearothermophilus confirmed that it actually corresponded to a peptide deformylase with properties similar to those of the e. coli enzyme. alignment of the nine peptide deformylase sequences showed that, in addition to the two above sequences, only a third one, gxgxaaxq, is strictly conserved. this motif is also located in the active site according to the three-dimensional structure of the e. coli enzyme. site-directed variants of  e. coli peptide deformylase showed the involvement of the corresponding residues  for maintaining an active and stable enzyme. altogether, these data allow us to propose that the three identified conserved motifs of peptide deformylases build  up the active site around a metal ion. finally, an analysis of the location of the other conserved residues, in particular of the hydrophobic ones, was performed using the three-dimensional model of the e. coli enzyme. this enables us to suggest that all bacterial peptide deformylases adopt a constant overall tertiary structure.

TI  == a novel transporter involved in cobalt uptake.
AB  == cobalt is an essential component of a low molecular-mass nitrile hydratase (l-nhase) from rhodococcus rhodochrous j1. we have found a new gene, nhlf, in the dna region sandwiched between nhlba encoding l-nhase and amda encoding amidase, which are involved in the degradation of nitriles. the product of nhlf, nhlf, shows a significant sequence similarity with those of hoxn from alcaligenes eutrophus, hupn from bradyrhizobium japonicum, nixa from helicobacter pylori, and ureh from bacillus sp., which are considered to be involved in nickel uptake into these cells. sequence and hydropathy plot analyses have shown that nhlf encodes a 352-amino acid (aa) protein with eight hydrophobic putative membrane-spanning domains. nhlf expression in r. rhodochrous atcc 12674 and escherichia coli jm109  confers uptake of 57co in their cells, but not of 63ni. the expression of both nhlf and nhlba in r. rhodochrous atcc 12674 exhibited higher nhase activity than  nhlba expression. these findings together with the inhibitory effect by uncouplers (cccp and sf6847) for the cobalt uptake suggest that nhlf mediates the cobalt transport into the cell energy-dependently finally to provide l-nhase.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

AB  == isocitrate dehydrogenase from an extremely thermophilic bacterium, thermus aquaticus yt1, was purified to homogeneity, and the gene was cloned by using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on the n-terminal sequence. the gene consisted of a single open reading frame of 1,278 bp preceded by a shine-dalgarno ribosome binding site, and a terminator-like sequence was detected downstream of  the open reading frame. the g+c content of the coding region was 65%, and that of the third nucleotide of the codons was 93%. the amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed a relatively low level of similarity to the counterpart from t. thermophilus (35% identity) but showed higher levels of similarity (54 to 69% identity) to the other bacterial counterparts so far reported, including those from escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, vibrio sp., and anabaena sp. the cloned gene was highly expressed in e. coli and easily purified to homogeneity by heat treatment (70 degrees c, 30 min) and deae column chromatography to yield approximately 10 mg of protein from 1 g of wet cells. the recombinant enzyme showed high thermostability and almost the same heat denaturation profile as the  intact enzyme purified from the thermophile cells, implying that the recombinant  protein has the same structure as the intact one.

TI  == organization of the bacillus subtilis 168 chromosome between kdg and the attachment site of the sp beta prophage: use of long accurate pcr and yeast artificial chromosomes for sequencing.
AB  == within the bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, the region between lysa and ilva was assigned to our laboratory. in this report we present the sequence of the last 36 kb of this region, between the kdg operon and the attachment site  of the sp beta prophage. a two-step strategy was used for the sequencing. in the  first step, total chromosomal dna was cloned in phage m13-based vectors and the clones carrying inserts from the target region were identified by hybridization with a cognate yeast artificial chromosome (yac) from our collection. sequencing  of the clones allowed us to establish a number of contigs. in the second step the contigs were mapped by long accurate (la) pcr and the remaining gaps closed by sequencing of the pcr products. the level of sequence inaccuracy due to la pcr errors appeared to be about 1 in 10,000, which does not affect significantly the  final sequence quality. this two-step strategy is efficient and we suggest that it can be applied to sequencing of longer chromosomal regions. the 36 kb sequence contains 38 coding sequences (cdss), 19 of which encode unknown proteins. seven genetic loci already mapped in this region, xpt, metb, ilva, ilvd, thyb, dfra and degr were identified. eleven cdss were found to display significant similarities  to known proteins from the data banks, suggesting possible functions for some of  the novel genes: cspd may encode a cold shock protein; bcsa, the first bacterial  homologue of chalcone synthase; exol, a 5' to 3' exonuclease, similar to that of  dna polymerase i of escherichia coli; and bsaa, a stress-response-associated protein. the protein encoded by yplp has homology with the transcriptional nifa-like regulators. the arrangement of the genes relative to possible promoters and terminators suggests 19 potential transcription units.

AB  == we have cloned and sequenced the dnaa region of synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, a bacterium with a light-dependent cell cycle. the dnaa gene product, dnaa, is the central factor for replication initiation in bacteria. the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the cyanobacterial dnaa gene is 45% identical  to dnaa of bacillus subtilis and fits very well into the homology pattern of the  known eubacterial dnaa proteins. the genetic environment of the synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803 dnaa gene is completely different from the one in other eubacteria. an open reading frame of unknown function, orf134, was detected upstream of dnaa. the purt gene homolog encoding the glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase t starts about 200 bp away from this open reading frame in the opposite direction. downstream of the dnaa gene we detected the start of the psbdc operon, which codes for the photosystem ii reaction center proteins d2 and  cp43 that are involved in the positioning of chlorophyll a.

TI  == [gene technology to overproduce the enzymes useful as diagnostic reagents].
AB  == we cloned the genes encoding the microbial enzymes described below and discussed  the possibility as the diagnostic reagents: creatinase(cr) and sarcosine oxidase(sox) are useful for a diagnostic measurement of creatinine in combination with creatinase. bacillus sp. b-0618 produces both cr and sox enzymes when grown  in the presence of an inducer, choline chloride. we cloned these two genes encoding cr and sox by using recombinant dna techniques. we found that the sox-encoding gene is located upstream from the cr-encoding gene. when the cr- and sox-encoding genes were independently inserted into the puc-based vector and introduced into escherichia coli, the transformants produced 15.5-fold more cr and 50-fold more sox than bacillus sp. b-0618, respectively, in the absence of the inducer. although the bacillus sox is a flavoprotein, we created an fad-free  sox by site-directed dna mutagenesis. the mutant protein no longer expressed the  sox activity. cholesterol esterase is useful for a diagnostic measurement of total cholesterol in combination with cholesterol oxidase. we cloned a gene encoding the cholesterol esterase enzyme. when the gene was introduced into the non-producing streptomyces strain, the transformant produced the cholesterol esterase. phospholipase a2 is a diverse family of enzymes that hydrolyze the sn-2 fatty acyl ester bond of phosphoglycerides producing free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. the enzymes are present in pancreatic juice and in the venoms  of snakes and bees, where they serve digestive functions.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the gene xyaa encoding an alkaline endo-beta 1,4-xylanase from an alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain (n137) isolated in our laboratory was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of a 1,656-bp dna fragment containing xyaa was determined, revealing one open reading frame of 993 bp that encodes a xylanase (xyaa) of 39 kda. this xylanase lacks a typical putative signal peptide, yet the protein is found in the bacillus culture supernatant. in escherichia coli, the active protein is located mainly in the periplasmic space. the xylanase activity of the cloned xyaa is an endo-acting enzyme that shows optimal activity  at ph 8 and 40 degrees c. this activity is stable at a ph between 6 and 11. incubations of xyaa at 40 degrees c for 1 h destroyed 45% of the activity.

AB  == to obtain a new serine protease from alkalophilic bacillus sp. nks-21, shotgun cloning was carried out. as a result, a new protease gene was obtained. it encoded an intracellular serine protease (isp-1) in which there was no signal sequence. the molecular weight was 34,624. the protease showed about 50% homology with those of intracellular serine proteases (isp-1) from bacillus subtilis, b. polymyxa, and alkalophilic bacillus sp. no. 221. the amino acid residues that form the catalytic triad, ser, his and asp, were completely conserved in comparison with subtilisins (the extracellular proteases from bacillus). the cloned intracellular protease was expressed in escherichia coli, and its purification and characterization were carried out. the enzyme showed stability under alkaline condition at ph 10 and tolerance to surfactants. the cloned isp-1  digested well nucleoproteins, clupein and salmin, for the substrates.

TI  == dna restriction-modification systems mediate plasmid maintenance.
AB  == two plasmid-carried restriction-modification (r-m) systems, ecori (from pmb1 of escherichia coli) and bsp6i (from pxh13 of bacillus sp. strain rfl6), enhance plasmid segregational stability in e. coli and bacillus subtilis, respectively. inactivation of the endonuclease or the presence of the methylase in trans abolish the stabilizing activity of the r-m systems. we propose that r-m systems  mediate plasmid segregational stability by postsegregational killing of plasmid-free cells. plasmid-encoded methyltransferase modifies host dna and thus  prevents its digestion by the restriction endonuclease. plasmid loss entails degradation and/or dilution of the methylase during cell growth and appearance of unmethylated sites in the chromosome. double-strand breaks, introduced at these sites by the endonuclease, eventually cause the death of the plasmid-free cells.  contribution to plasmid stability is a previously unrecognized biological role of the r-m systems.

TI  == cloning and analysis of the plasmid-borne genes encoding the bsp6i restriction and modification enzymes.
AB  == the bsp6i restriction and modification (r-m) system has been localized on the plasmid pxh13, naturally occurring in the bacillus sp. strain rfl6. the genes coding for the bsp6i r-m system, a fnu4hi isoschizomer recognizing the sequence gcngc, have been cloned in escherichia coli by two steps. the nucleotide sequence of a 2126-bp region containing the genes for restriction endonuclease (enase; bsp6ir) and dna methyltransferase (mtase; bsp6im) has been determined. the genes  are separated by 99 bp and are arranged tandemly with bsp6ir preceding bsp6im. the dna sequence predicts an enase of 174 amino acids (aa) (19.9 kda) and a mtase of 315 aa (36.3 kda). m.bsp6i contains all the conserved aa sequence motifs characteristic for m5c-mtases. in addition, its variable region exhibits a slight similarity to the 5'-gcngc-3'-specific target-recognition domain (trd) from m.phi 3t. no aa sequence similarity was found between r.bsp6i and m.bsp6i, nor among r.bsp6i and other known enases. we have tested recombinant plasmids carrying the  complete r-m system for their ability to transform native and pre-methylated escherichia coli hosts. the results indicate that pre-methylation increases the efficiency of establishment of the complete r-m system. in addition, we have obtained orientation-dependent differences in transformation efficiency.

AB  == the gene for an alkaline serine protease from alkalophilic bacillus sp. nks-21 (subtilisin alp i) was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the gene (aprq) contained an open reading frame of 1125 bp, encoding a primary product of 374 amino acids. the mature protease, composed of 272 amino acids, was preceded by a putative signal sequence of 37 amino acids and a pro-sequence of 65 amino acids. the mature protease conserved the catalytic triad, asp, his, and ser, as subtilisin bpn' or other subtilisins, and the subtilisin alp i might belong to the subtilisin super family. the primary structure of subtilisin alp i  was compared and discussed with those of 13 subtilisins, 5 subtilisins from alkalophilic bacillus, and 8 from neutrophiles. low homology was shown between subtilisin alp i and subtilisins from alkalophiles or subtilisins from neutrophiles. forty-five amino acid residues of the mature protein of subtilisin  alp i were entirely independent of other subtilisins. according to the homology of alp i with other subtilisins, subtilisin alp i might be in the middle point between alkaline subtilisins and neutral ones.

TI  == mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  == mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by bacillus sp. strain hil y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (s. chatterjee, d. k. chatterjee, r. h. jani, j. blumbach, b. n. ganguli, n. klesel, m. limbert, and g. seibert, j. antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). incubation of staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. biosyntheses of dna, rna, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and d-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. thus, unlike type a lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. the formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. in contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. these data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

AB  == a simple method was established for determination of the stereospecificity of c-4' hydrogen transfer of the coenzymes (pyridoxal and pyridoxamine). the method  is based on the findings that aspartate aminotransferase of pig heart and d-amino acid aminotransferase of bacillus sp. ym-1 catalyze the abstraction of the pro-s  and pro-r proton at c-4' of pyridoxamine, respectively. pyridoxal is a poor coenzyme, but readily released from the enzyme. it reacts in 3h2o with a substrate amino acid and an apo-aminotransferase whose stereospecificity for c-4' hydrogen transfer is to be determined. the resultant pyridoxamine which is tritiated at c-4' is incubated with an apo form of aspartate aminotransferase or  d-amino acid aminotransferase and a substrate, alpha-keto acid. the stereospecificity for the c-4' hydrogen transfer examined is determined by measurement of radioactivity retained in the pyridoxal formed. we showed by means of this method that c-4' hydrogen transfer of coenzyme occurs on the si face of the external schiff base in the transamination reactions of two aspartate aminotransferases of bacillus sp. ym-2 and escherichia coli, and aromatic amino acid aminotransferase of e. coli.

AB  == a 1.6-kb dna fragment from the soil actinomycete, streptomyces sp. strain n174, containing the gene (csn) encoding an extracellular chitosanase (csn), has been isolated and its complete nucleotide sequence determined. the gene was expressed  in escherichia coli and streptomyces lividans using appropriate vectors. the sequence was found to contain one large orf which encodes a protein of 238 amino  acids (aa). the deduced aa sequence begins with a signal peptide which has an unusual c-terminal segment, well recognized by the streptomyces secretion system, but poorly in escherichia coli. the strain n174 csn aa sequence was compared with those of other proteins and significant homology was found only with the bacillus circulans mh-k1 csn but not with known chitinases or lysozymes. this suggests that csn form a new enzyme family distinct from other endoglycosidases.

TI  == clustering and co-transcription of the bacillus subtilis genes encoding the aminoacyl-trna synthetases specific for glutamate and for cysteine and the first  enzyme for cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  == the bacillus subtilis cyse and cyss genes encoding, respectively, the serine acetyltransferase and the cysteinyl-trna synthetase were found downstream from the gltx gene encoding the glutamyl-trna synthetase. this gene organization is also conserved in bacillus stearothermophilus where the cyse and cyss genes show  high amino acid identity with those of b. subtilis. in both organisms the coding  sequences of cyse and cyss overlap, suggesting a translational coupling. b. subtilis cyse and cyss were expressed in escherichia coli using the inducible trc promoter; they functionally complement mutants of e. coli affected in those genes. overproduction of b. subtilis cysrs in e. coli has a toxic effect on cell  growth. disruption of gltx and cyss by campbell-type insertion is lethal for the  cell, indicating that these genes code for an essential and unique function in b. subtilis. s1 mapping analysis shows that the transcription of gltx is under the control of a sigma a promoter located 43 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon. a t-box sequence and a rho-independent terminator known to regulate expression of other aminoacyl-trna synthetase genes and of some amino acid biosynthetic operons in bacillus sp., were found between gltx and cyse. no sigma  a promoter was detected upstream of cyse, which is consistent with the lethality  of a campbell-type insertion using a plasmid that interrupts transcription coming from the gltx promoter, and suggests that gltx, cyse, and cyss constitute an operon. this is the first case where genes implicated in the biosynthesis of an amino acid and its cognate aminoacyl-trna synthetase are shown to be co-transcribed.

TI  == structure and expression of a gene coding for thermostable alpha-glucosidase with a broad substrate specificity from bacillus sp. sam1606.
AB  == we cloned an alpha-glucosidase gene from thermophilic bacillus sp. sam1606 to overexpress it in escherichia coli transformants. deletion of the 5'-noncoding region as well as expression of the alpha-glucosidase gene under the control of the icp promotor of the insecticidal crystal protein gene from bacillus thuringiensis subsp. sotto enhanced the enzyme productivity to 23.5 u/ml, which was 12,000-fold higher than that obtained by the strain sam1606. the open reading frame corresponding to the alpha-glucosidase encoded 587 amino acid residues including a residue coded by the initiation codon ttg, and the molecular mass of  the alpha-glucosidase from n-terminal serine was calculated to be 68,886 da. sequence analysis revealed that the sam1606 alpha-glucosidase belonged to the alpha-amylase family. the sam1606 alpha-glucosidase showed extremely high sequence identity (62-65%) to the bacillus cereus and bacillus thermoglucosidasius oligo-1,6-glucosidases, which were 72% identical to each other. sequence identity in the suggested active site regions were essentially the same (80-82%) among these three enzymes. however, the substrate specificity of the sam1606 alpha-glucosidase was significantly different from those of the oligo-1,6-glucosidases. the thermostability of these three alpha-glucosidases could be correlated with the increase in the number of proline residues, whose occurrence was predicted at beta turns and coils in the enzymes.

AB  == the urease of thermophilic bacillus sp. strain tb-90 is composed of three subunits with molecular masses of 61, 12, and 11 kda. by using synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on n-terminal amino acid sequences of each subunit,  we cloned a 3.2-kb ecori fragment of tb-90 genomic dna. moreover, we cloned two other dna fragments by gene walking starting from this fragment. finally, we reconstructed in vitro a 6.2-kb dna fragment which expressed catalytically active urease in escherichia coli by combining these three dna fragments. nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed that the urease gene complex consists of nine genes, which were designed urea, ureb, urec, uree, uref, ureg, ured, ureh, and urei in order of arrangement. the structural genes urea, ureb, and urec encode the 11-, 12-, and 61-kda subunits, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of ured, uree, uref, and ureg, the gene products of four accessory genes, are homologous to those of the corresponding ure proteins of klebsiella aerogenes. ured, uref, and ureg were essential for expression of urease activity in e. coli and are suggested to play important roles in the maturation step of the urease in a co- and/or posttranslational manner. on the other hand, ureh and urei exhibited no significant similarity to the known accessory proteins of other bacteria. however, ureh showed 23% amino acid identity to the alcaligenes eutrophus hoxn protein, a high-affinity nickel transporter.

TI  == anabaena xisf gene encodes a developmentally regulated site-specific recombinase.
AB  == two dna elements are excised from the chromosome during anabaena heterocyst differentiation. we have identified the gene xisf which encodes the site-specific recombinase responsible for the excision of a 55-kb element from within the fdxn  gene. the cloned xisf gene is sufficient to cause site-specific rearrangement of  an artificial substrate in escherichia coli. inactivation of xisf in the anabaena chromosome prevents excision of the fdxn element and growth in nitrogen-deficient medium but does not alter the development of heterocysts. forced transcription of xisf in vegetative cells did not result in excision of the fdxn element, suggesting that other factors may be involved in cell-type specificity. the predicted xisf protein shows significant similarity to the bacillus subtilis spoivca recombinase.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis of putative active-site amino acid residues of 3,2-trans-enoyl-coa isomerase, conserved within the low-homology isomerase/hydratase enzyme family.
AB  == during beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, mitochondrial 3,2-trans-enoyl-coa isomerase (meci) converts 3-cis- or 3-trans-enoyl-coa intermediates into their 2-trans isomers. the cdna-derived amino acid sequence of meci shows weak but significant homologies to the peroxisomal trifunctional enzyme (ptfe), the alpha-subunit of the fatty acid degradation complex from escherichia coli (fadb), the mitochondrial 2-enoyl-coa hydratase (mech), the naphthoate synthase encoded by the menb gene from bacillus subtilis (menb), and the 4-chlorobenzoyl-coa dehalogenase from pseudomonas sp. (cbdh). these proteins  from the isomerase/hydratase enzyme family. tyr-150, arg-151, and asp-211 of the  meci are the only amino acids with protic side chains conserved within the enzymes with isomerase activity (ptfe and fadb). these amino acids are exchanged  in the remaining enzymes of the isomerase/hydratase family. glu-165 is conserved  in all enzymes with isomerase and/or hydratase activity (ptfe, fadb, and mech). we argue that these amino acids are possibly involved in the proton transfer at the active site of meci. to test this hypothesis, meci was functionally expressed in e. coli. the recombinant enzyme (rmeci) exhibits the same specific activity as the enzyme from rat liver. exchange of the candidate active-site amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that tyr-150 is not involved in isomerase catalysis. the exchange of arg-151 and asp-211 leads to a reduced expression of the recombinant enzyme accompanied by a reduced specific activity. the replacement of glu-165 by gln leads to a strongly reduced enzymatic activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == construction of a model secretion system for oral streptococci.
AB  == a dna fragment corresponding to the secretory domain from the streptococcus mutans gs-5 gtfb gene, which encodes the putative 38-amino-acid signal peptide of the glucosyltransferase i (gtf-i) enzyme product, has been constructed. this fragment was fused with the alpha-amylase structural gene from alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain 707. this hybrid gene as well as the intact amylase gene were introduced into an escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector consisting of three components: the e. coli replicon p15aori from pacyc177, an erythromycin resistance gene from pam beta-1, and the streptococcal replicon from pva838. transformation of the oral noncariogenic bacterium streptococcus gordonii with the chimeric plasmid harboring the hybrid amylase gene resulted in strong extracellular amylase production. by contrast, transformants containing the intact amylase gene exhibited only trace amounts of amylase activity in culture fluids. since the two signal peptide structures of the gtf-i enzyme and the bacillus amylase are distinct from each other, these differences might result from the inability of s. gordonii to correctly process the bacillus signal peptide. furthermore, culture fluids from transformants of s. mutans as well as streptococcus milleri harboring the hybrid amylase gene showed only weak amylase  activity. deletion of the gtfb, gtfc, or ftf gene from s. mutans gs-5 did not increase amylase secretion following transformation with the hybrid amylase gene. these results suggest that in contrast to s. gordonii, the inability of s. mutans and s. milleri to secrete hybrid amylase molecules could result from incorrect interaction of the secretory components of these organisms with amylase precursor molecules.

TI  == three histidine residues in the active center of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase  from alkalophilic bacillus sp. 1011: effects of the replacement on ph dependence  and transition-state stabilization.
AB  == cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (cgtase) catalyzes the formation of cyclodextrins from amylose through an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction. on the basis  of the three-dimensional structures of cgtases three histidine residues, which are conserved between cgtases and alpha-amylases, are located at the active center and are proposed to constitute the substrate binding sites. the three histidine residues (his-140, his-233, and his-327) of cgtase from alkalophilic bacillus sp. 1011 were individually replaced by site-directed mutagenesis to probe their roles in catalysis. asparagine-replaced cgtases (h140n-, h233n-, and  h327n-cgtase) retained cyclization activity but had altered production ratios of  alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin. replacement of histidine by asparagine residues strongly affected the kcat for beta-cyclodextrin-forming, coupling, and  hydrolyzing activities, whereas it barely affected the km values. the activation  energies for alpha-cyclodextrin hydrolysis were increased more than 12 kj/mol by  the replacement. furthermore, the ki values of acarbose, which is thought to be a transition-state analog of glycosidase catalysis, were 2-3 orders of magnitude larger in asparagine-replaced cgtases than that in wild-type cgtase. therefore, the three histidine residues participate in the stabilization of the transition state, whereas they participate little in ground-state substrate binding. h327n-cgtase had decreased activity over an alkaline ph range, indicating that his-327 is important for catalysis over an alkaline ph range.

TI  == multisensory activation of the phosphorelay initiating sporulation in bacillus subtilis: identification and sequence of the protein kinase of the alternate pathway.
AB  == the phosphorelay is the signal-transduction system recognizing and integrating environmental signals to initiate sporulation. the major signal input to the phosphorelay is an atp-dependent kinase, kina, responsible for phosphorylating the spoof protein. mutants lacking kina, however, still sporulate, suggesting that other kinases can fulfil its role. in order to identify these kinases, genes for kinases were isolated by hybridization using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe designed for common regions of this class of kinases. a gene for a second kinase, kinb, was isolated which gave a sporulation negative phenotype when inactivated in a kina background. the kinb locus was sequenced and found to be a  small operon consisting of the kinb gene and another gene, kapb, transcribed from a single.sigma a.-dependent promoter. inactivation of either kinb or kapb in a kina strain led to severe sporulation deficiency. the kinb gene coded for a 47774 m(r) protein with the carboxyl half of this protein highly homologous to the same domain of kina. the amino-terminal domain of kinb was hydrophobic with six recognizable membrane-spanning regions. the kapb gene coded for a moderately charged, probably soluble, protein of 14,668 m(r) with no homology to any known protein. genetic evidence suggests that kapb is required either for the function  of kinb or for its expression. although double mutants kina kinb cannot sporulate and assume a stage 0 phenotype, the spoa approximately p-dependent regulation of  the abrb gene is normal in these strains, suggesting that low levels of spoa approximately p accumulate even in the absence of both kinases. this accumulation is dependent on functional spo0f and spo0b genes and its source is unknown. the kina and kinb pathways are the only pathways capable of producing sufficient spo0a approximately p to allow initiation and completion of sporulation under laboratory conditions.

AB  == in the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 and in the enterobacterium escherichia coli delta-amino-levulinic acid (ala) is formed from glutamyl-trna by the sequential action of two enzymes, glutamyl-trna reductase (glutr) and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase. e. coli has two glutr proteins with sizes of 45 kda (glutr45) and 85 kda (glutr85) (jahn, d., michelsen, u., and soll, d. (1991) j. biol. chem. 266, 2542-2548). the hema gene, isolated from e. coli and several other eubacteria, has been proposed to encode a structural component of glutr. because of the inability to overexpress this gene in e. coli, we demonstrate directly glutr function for the e. coli hema gene product by its expression and functional analysis in yeast, which does not form ala from glu-trna. gel filtration experiments demonstrated definitively that the yeast-expressed hema protein corresponded to glutr45. furthermore, analysis of glutr activity in an e. coli strain with a disrupted hema gene displayed glutr85, but not glutr45 activity. the hema gene from synechocystis 6803 was cloned by functional complementation in e. coli. dna sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a 427-amino acid polypeptide (molecular mass of 47,525 da). the synechocystis 6803 amino acid sequence shows significant similarity upon alignment with hema sequences from e. coli, bacillus subtilis, salmonella typhimurium, and chlorobium vibrioforme but does not contain the amino acid sequence derived from the n terminus of the previously purified glutr protein (rieble, s., and beale, s. i. (1991) j. biol. chem. 266, 9740-9745). these experiments are the first direct demonstration of glutr activity of the hema protein and provide further evidence for two pathways of ala formation in prokaryotes.

TI  == organization and characterization of three genes involved in d-xylose catabolism  in lactobacillus pentosus.
AB  == a cluster of three genes involved in d-xylose catabolism (viz. xylose genes) in lactobacillus pentosus has been cloned in escherichia coli and characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. the deduced gene products show considerable sequence similarity to a repressor protein involved in the regulation of expression of xylose genes in bacillus subtilis (58%), to e. coli and b. subtilis d-xylose isomerase (68% and 77%, respectively), and to e. coli d-xylulose kinase  (58%). the cloned genes represent functional xylose genes since they are able to  complement the inability of a l. casei strain to ferment d-xylose. nmr analysis confirmed that 13c-xylose was converted into 13c-acetate in l. casei cells transformed with l. pentosus xylose genes but not in untransformed l. casei cells. comparison with the aligned amino acid sequences of d-xylose isomerases of different bacteria suggests that l. pentosus d-xylose isomerase belongs to the same similarity group as b. subtilis and e. coli d-xylose isomerase and not to a  second similarity group comprising d-xylose isomerases of streptomyces violaceoniger, ampullariella sp. and actinoplanes. the organization of the l. pentosus xylose genes, 5'-xylr (1167 bp, repressor) - xyla (1350 bp, d-xylose isomerase) - xylb (1506 bp, d-xylulose kinase) - 3' is similar to that in b. subtilis. in contrast to b. subtilis xylr, l. pentosus xylr is transcribed in the same direction as xyla and xylb.

TI  == utility of phenomenological models for describing temperature dependence of bacterial growth.
AB  == we compared three unstructured mathematical models, the master reaction, the square root, and the damage/repair models, for describing the relationship between temperature and the specific growth rates of bacteria. the models were evaluated on the basis of several criteria: applicability, ease of use, simple interpretation of model parameters, problem-free determination of model parameters, statistical evaluation of goodness of fit (chi 2 test), and biological relevance. best-fit parameters for the master reaction model could be  obtained by using two consecutive nonlinear least-square fits. the damage/repair  model proved to be unsuited for the data sets considered and was judged markedly  overparameterized. the square root model allowed nonproblematical parameter estimation by a nonlinear least-square procedure and, together with the master reaction model, was able to describe the temperature dependence of the specific growth rates of klebsiella pneumoniae ncib 418, escherichia coli nc3, bacillus sp. strain ncib 12522, and the thermotolerant coccobacillus strain na17. the square root and master reaction models were judged to be equally valid and superior to the damage/repair model, even though the square root model is devoid  of a conceptual basis.

AB  == the cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of a 3 kb dna segment on pls206 containing a xylanase gene (xynb) from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c was investigated. the open reading frame (orf) of 1905 bp encoded a xylanase of 635 amino acid residues (mr 73156). at least 850 bp at the 3' end of the gene could be deleted without loss of xylanase activity. the deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by purifying the enzyme and subjecting it to n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. in escherichia coli c600 (pls206) cells the xylanase was localized in the cytoplasm. its optimum ph for activity was between ph 5.4 and 6, and optimum temperature 55 degrees c. the primary structure of the xylanase showed a significant level of identity with a cellobiohydrolase/endoglucanase of  caldocellum saccharolyticum, as well as with the xylanases of the alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain c-125, b. fibrisolvens strain 49, and pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the gene encoding the principal sigma factor of the vegetative cell rna polymerase from the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. strain pcc 7120.
AB  == the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp. strain pcc 7120 responds to combined  nitrogen deprivation by forming specialized nitrogen-fixing cells at regular intervals along the filament. genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that regulation of gene expression during differentiation occurs at the transcriptional level. as part of a characterization of rna polymerase during differentiation, the gene encoding the 52-kda principal sigma factor of the anabaena sp. strain pcc 7120 vegetative-cell rna polymerase was isolated by using an oligonucleotide probe based on the sequence of the n-terminal seven amino acids of the purified protein. siga codes for a 390-amino-acid polypeptide that has a predicted molecular weight of 45,641. the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by siga contains four regions corresponding to conserved domains of the principal rna polymerase sigma factors of escherichia coli (sigma  70) and bacillus subtilis (sigma 43). thus, although the subunit composition of cyanobacterial rna polymerase core differs from that of other eubacteria (g. j. schneider and r. haselkorn, j. bacteriol. 170:4136-4140, 1988), the principal sigma factor of at least one cyanobacterium is typically eubacterial. in contrast to sigma 70 and sigma 43 operon organization, siga is monocistronic and encodes two transcripts of 1.7 and 2.2 kb. the abundance of the 1.7-kb transcript remains constant under both nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limiting conditions, whereas the 2.2-kb transcript is induced following the removal of combined nitrogen. continued or enhanced transcription of siga under nitrogen starvation conditions  is consistent with the observation that the principal rna polymerase in differentiating cells contains siga.

TI  == construction and characterization of the chimeric enzymes between the bacillus subtilis cellulase and an alkalophilic bacillus cellulase.
AB  == the amino acid sequences of cellulase from bacillus subtilis (bsc) and that from  an alkalophilic bacillus sp. n-4 (nk1) show significant homology in most parts except for the c-terminal portions. despite the high homology, the ph activity profiles of the two enzymes are quite different; bsc has its optimum ph at 6-6.5, whereas nk1 is active over a broad ph range from 6 to 10.5. in order to identify  the structural features which determine such ph activity profiles, chimeric cellulases between bsc and nk1 were constructed using four restriction sites commonly present within the homologous coding sequences, and were produced in escherichia coli. the chimeric cellulases showed various chromatographic behaviors, reflecting the origins of their c-terminal regions. the ph activity profiles of the chimeric enzymes in the alkaline range could be classified into either the bsc or nk1 type mainly depending on the origins of the fifth c-terminal regions. in the acidic range, the profile was determined only by the origin of the fourth enzyme region from the n terminus. comparison of the kinetic parameters between ph 5 and 6 using p-nitrophenyl cellobioside as a substrate indicated that the fourth region is responsible for the ph-dependent change of the kcat value. only a limited number of amino acids in the fourth region may affect on deprotonation of catalytic residues of the cellulases and modulate the  catalytic activity in the acidic ph values.

TI  == identification of essential histidine residues in the active site of escherichia  coli xylose (glucose) isomerase.
AB  == two conserved histidine residues (his-101 and his-271) appear to be essential components in the active site of the enzyme xylose (glucose) isomerase (ec 5.3.1.5). these amino acid residues were targeted for mutagenesis on the basis of sequence homology among xylose isomerases isolated from escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, ampullariella sp. strain 3876, and streptomyces violaceus-niger. each residue was selectively replaced by site-directed mutagenesis and shown to be essential for activity. no measurable activity was observed for any mutations replacing either his-101 or his-271. circular dichroism measurements revealed no significant change in the overall conformation of the mutant enzymes, and all formed dimers similar to the wild-type enzyme. mutations at his-271 could be distinguished from those at his-101, since the former resulted in a thermolabile protein whereas no significant change in heat stability was observed for the latter. based upon these results and structural data recently reported, we speculate that his-101 is the catalytic base mediating the reaction. replacement of his-271 may render the enzyme thermolabile, since this residue appears to be a ligand for one of the metal ions in the active site  of the enzyme.

AB  == using 12 chimeric cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases (cgtases) constructed from two genes, the cgtase gene from the alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain no. 38-2 (cgtase 38-2 gene) and the cgtase gene from the alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain no. 17-1 (cgtase 17-1 gene), we compared the effect of those chimeric enzymes on cyclodextrin (cd) production, especially on the composition of the cds produced. it was found that the n-terminal and the c-terminal segments were important for cd production. chimeric enzymes that contained the n-terminal and the c-terminal segments derived from cgtase 38-2 produced large amounts of cd, and especially a higher proportion of alpha-cd than those of other chimeric enzymes.

TI  == two bacillus beta-mannanases having different cooh termini are produced in escherichia coli carrying pmah5.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence was determined for the alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain am-001 beta-mannanase gene which produced two beta-mannanases (a and b) in escherichia coli transformants. the putative beta-mannanase gene was 1,539 base pairs long and encoded a mature beta-mannanase protein of 487 amino acids and a signal peptide of 26 amino acids. the cooh-terminal amino acid of beta-mannanase  a is an arginine residue located at amino acid 513 of the deduced amino acid sequence, and that of beta-mannanase b is a valine residue located at amino acid  365. deletion derivatives having 1,098 base pairs from the atg start codon maintained the beta-mannanase activity of the encoded polypeptide. however, clones harboring dna fragments (1,051 base pairs) shorter than the gene which encoded beta-mannanase b (1,095 base pairs) did not exhibit the beta-mannanase activity. the simultaneous production of both beta-mannanases a and b in an e. coli transformant was demonstrated by the maxicell procedure.

TI  == construction of a chimeric series of bacillus cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases and analysis of the thermal stabilities and ph optima of the  enzymes.
AB  == the cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (cgtase, ec 2.4.1.19) gene from the alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain no. 17-1 was cloned in escherichia coli. the cloned cgtase gene consisted of a single open reading frame which would encode a  polypeptide of 713 amino acids, and the first 27 amino acid residues comprised a  signal peptide. the nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of this cgtase (cgtase 17-1) gene had strong homology with those of the cgtase (cgtase 38-2) gene previously cloned in our laboratory from the alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain no. 38-2, although the enzymic properties of the cgtase 17-1 were distinct from those of the cgtase 38-2. to analyse those enzymic properties further, we constructed 12 chimeric cgtases using three restriction nuclease sites and compared the enzymic properties of the chimeric cgtases. the n-terminal part of the enzyme was important for heat stability, and the ph-activity profile was influenced by both the n- and the c-terminal parts. a third segment was less important for enzymic properties.

AB  == the flavoenzyme mercuric ion reductase from bacillus sp. strain rc607 was purified by dye-ligand affinity chromatography. the protein was crystallized from solutions of high ionic strength, and one of the two crystal forms obtained has proven suitable for x-ray diffraction studies. preliminary analysis showed that these crystals belong to the tetragonal space group 1422. the unit cell dimensions are a = b = 180.7 a; c = 127.9 a. the diffraction pattern extends to better than 3 a resolution. crystal density measurements are consistent with one  enzyme dimer of 2 x 69,000 da comprising the asymmetric unit. trypsin treatment of the native enzyme resulted in the removal of 157 amino acids at the n terminus. after purification, the remaining fragment (amino acids 158-631), which is still fully active in vitro, could be crystallized under the same conditions as native enzyme. twinning problems, however, did not allow complete analysis of  these crystals.

TI  == functions of the cooh-terminal region of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase of alkalophilic bacillus sp. #1011: relation to catalyzing activity and ph stability.
AB  == cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (beta-cgtase) of alkalophilic bacillus sp. #1011  degrades starch to mainly beta-cyclodextrin (beta-cd). this enzyme is considered  to contain an extra-polypeptide in its cooh-terminal region in addition to its nh2-terminal domain which exhibits the starch-degrading activity. to analyze the  functions of this extra-polypeptide in the beta-cgtase, two mutated enzymes, in which dna regions encoding 10 or 13 amino acids from the cooh-terminus were deleted, were obtained. the mutated enzymes degraded starch to glucose, maltooligosaccharides and alpha-cd, in addition to beta-cd. furthermore, the ph stability of the mutated enzymes in the alkaline ph range (ph 9-11) was reduced.

AB  == the third cellulase gene (celc) of bacillus sp. strain n-4 was cloned in plasmid  pbr322 and was located within a 5.5-kb hindiii fragment. the cellulase encoded by this fragment had an mr of about 100,000 and showed optimum activity around ph 9. these properties were different from those of the enzymes encoded by the cela and celb genes of the same organism. the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was found to be highly homologous to the cel-f enzyme from bacillus sp. strain no. 1139 [fukumori et al., j. gen. microbiol. 132 (1986) 2329-2335]. an evolutionary relationship observed among the four cellulases of alkalophilic bacillus strains and that of bacillus subtilis endoglucanase suggested that ancestral genes for alkaline and neutral cellulases diverged early in the evolution of these enzymes.

TI  == a new cloning system for bacillus subtilis comprising elements of phage, plasmid  and transposon vectors.
AB  == a new cloning system for bacillus subtilis was devised which makes use of a combination of tn917-containing phage sp beta derivatives and tn917-containing escherichia coli-b. subtilis shuttle plasmids. this system allows the initial cloning of genes in single copy, via 'prophage transformation', with a selection  for complementation of mutational defects in b. subtilis hosts and permits subsequent transfer of the cloned material by homologous recombination to low-copy and high-copy vectors that replicate in both b. subtilis and e. coli. because cloned sequences are adjacent to pb322-derived dna in the recombinant phages, inserts can also be 'rescued' directly from the phage dna after digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, circularization of the fragments by ligation and transformation of an e. coli recipient. two genomic libraries of b.  subtilis chromosomal sau3a-generated partial-digest fragments in the size ranges  of 5-8 kb and 8-10 kb were constructed and screened for the complementation of mutations aroi906, cysa14, dal-1, glyb133, metc3, pura16, purb33, thra5, trpc2 and rece4. in all cases, specialized transducing phages carrying inserts that complemented the selected markers were recovered. inserts complementing the dal-1 and trpc2 mutations could be transferred from recombinant phages to tn917-containing plasmids by homologous recombination without in vitro subcloning. another insert complementing the purb33 mutation was rescued directly into e. coli from a recombinant phage dna.

TI  == identification of the promoter for a peptide antibiotic biosynthesis gene from bacillus brevis and its regulation in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == tyrocidine is a cyclic decapeptide antibiotic which is produced and secreted by stationary-phase cells of the sporeforming bacterium bacillus brevis. we identified the promoter for the b. brevis structural gene (tyca) for tyrocidine synthetase i, the enzyme catalyzing the first step in tyrocidine biosynthesis, and studied its regulation in cells of b. brevis and bacillus subtilis. transcription from the tyca promoter was induced at the end of the exponential phase of the growth cycle in b. brevis cells growing in sporulation medium. to study the regulation of tyca in b. subtilis, we constructed a derivative of the b. subtilis bacteriophage sp beta containing a transcriptional fusion of the tyca promoter to the lacz gene of escherichia coli and introduced the tyca-lacz operon fusion by means of specialized transduction into sporulation mutants known to be  blocked in sporulation-associated antibiotic production. our principal finding was that tyca-directed lacz expression was impaired in the stage-0 mutants with mutations spo0a, spo0b, and spo0e but not in spo0c, spo0f, spo0h, or spo+ bacteria. the dependence on the spo0a gene product could be entirely bypassed by  an abrb suppressor mutation, which caused tyca-lacz to be transcribed constitutively at all stages of growth. a simple model is proposed for the mechanism of tyca induction based on the spo0a-dependent inactivation of ab-b protein, which is proposed to be a negative regulator of tyca transcription.

TI  == integrable alpha-amylase plasmid for generating random transcriptional fusions in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == an integrable plasmid, pok4, which replicated independently in escherichia coli was constructed for generating transcriptional fusions in vivo in bacillus dna. it did not replicate independently in bacillus subtilis, but it could be made to  integrate into the chromosome of b. subtilis if sequences homologous to chromosomal sequences were inserted into it. it had a selectable marker for chloramphenicol resistance and carried unique sites for ecori and smai just to the 5' side of a promoterless alpha-amylase gene from bacillus licheniformis. when b. subtilis dna fragments were ligated into one of these sites and the ligation mixture was used to transform an alpha-amylase-negative b. subtilis strain, chloramphenicol-resistant transformants could be isolated conveniently. many of these were alpha-amylase positive, owing to the fusion of the plasmid amylase gene to chromosomal operons. in principle, because integration need not be mutagenic, it is possible to obtain fusions to any chromosomal operon. the site of each integration can be mapped, and the flanking sequences can be cloned  into e. coli. the alpha-amylase gene can be used to detect regulated genes. we used it as an indicator to detect operons which are dna-damage-inducible (din), and we identified insertions in both sp beta and pbsx prophages.

[parasponia] strain rp501 share homology with other regulatory proteins. there is extensive conservation of c-terminal regions between products of rp501 ntrb; klebsiella pneumoniae ntrb; escherichia coli envz, cpxa, and phor; agrobacterium tumefaciens vira; and, to a lesser extent, e. coli chea. there is also extensive conservation of n-terminal regions between products of rp501 ntrc; k. pneumoniae ntrc; e. coli ompr, sfra, phob, chey and cheb; salmonella typhimurium cheb and chey; bacillus subtilis spooa and spoof; and a. tumefaciens virg. we propose that these regulatory genes comprise two-component regulatory systems that evolved from a common ancestral system that involved transduction of information about the status of the environment by one protein domain (the c-terminal regions conserved among ntrb, envz, etc.) to a second one (the n-terminal region conserved among ntrc, ompr, etc.). the ntrc-set protein then acts upon a specific responding mechanism, typically as a transcriptional activator but also as an effector of the maturation of outer membrane proteins or as a modulator of the direction of flagella rotation.

TI  == multispecific dna methyltransferases from bacillus subtilis phages. properties of wild-type and various mutant enzymes with altered dna affinity.
AB  == temperate bacillus subtilis phages spr, phi 3t, rho 11 and sp beta code for dna methyltransferases, each having multiple sequence specificities. the spr wild-type and various mutant methyltransferases were overproduced 1000-fold in escherichia coli and were purified by three consecutive chromatographic steps. the stable form of these multispecific enzymes in solution are monomers with a relative molecular mass (mr) of about 50,000. the methyl-transfer kinetics of the spr wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined with dna substrates carrying either none or one of the three recognition sequences (ggcc, ccgg, ccatgg). evaluation of the catalytic properties for dna and s-adenosylmethionine binding suggested that the nh2-terminal part of the protein is important for both non-sequence-specific dna binding and s-adenosylmethionine binding as well as transfer of methyl groups. on the other hand, mutations in the cooh-terminal part lead to weaker site-specific interactions of the enzyme. antibodies raised against the purified spr enzyme specifically immunoprecipitated the phi 3t, rho 11 and sp beta methyltransferases, bu failed to precipitate the chromosomally coded enzymes from b. subtilis (bsuri) and b. sphaericus (bspri). immunoaffinity  chromatography is an efficient purification step for the related phage methyltransferases.

AB  == the gene encoding an extracellular metalloproteinase from serratia sp. e-15 has been cloned, and its complete nucleotide sequence determined. the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence reveals that the mature protein of  the serratia protease consists of 470 amino acids with a molecular weight of 50,632. the g+c content of the coding region for the mature protein is 58%; this  high g+c content is due to a marked preference for g+c bases at the third position of the codons. the gene codes for a short pro-peptide preceding the mature protein. the serratia protease gene was expressed in escherichia coli and  serratia marcescens; the former produced the serratia protease in the cells and the latter in the culture medium. three zinc ligands and an active site of the serratia protease were predicted by comparing the structure of the enzyme with those of thermolysin and bacillus subtilis neutral protease.

AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == cloning and expression of bacillus subtilis phage dna methyltransferase genes in  escherichia coli and b. subtilis.
AB  == the dna methyltransferase (mtase) genes of the temperate bacillus subtilis phages spr (wild type and various mutants), phi 3t, rho 11 and sp beta have been cloned  and expressed in escherichia coli and b. subtilis host-plasmid vector systems. mtase activity has been quantitated in these clones by performing in vitro methylation assays of cell-free extracts. the four-phage mtase genes differ in the amount of mtase synthesized when transcribed from their genuine promoters. in b. subtilis as well as in e. coli the spr mtase is always produced in smaller amounts than the other phage mtases. expression levels of the spr mtase are dependent on the strength of the upstream vector promoter sequences. overproduction of the spr wild-type and mutant enzymes was achieved in e. coli (inducible expression) by fusions to the lambda pl or the tac promoter and in b.  subtilis (constitutive expression) by means of the phage sp02 promoter.

TI  == bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

[3h]thymine-labelled dna from the replication terminus region of the b. subtilis  dna-1 chromosome was used to identify, by hybridization, clones harboring recombinant cosmids carrying inserts from the terminus region. restriction maps have been constructed for two such cosmids carrying overlapping dna inserts that  cover or extend into four of the previously identified five sali fragments which  are replicated last. the composite map of the cloned region, together with the available data on the replication order of fragments within it, is consistent with its replication being achieved by the unidirectional movement of a fork through it and towards the late replicating 16.2-kb sali fragment. most, if not all, of the terminus sequences in at least one of the recombinant cosmids are missing from a viable strain of b. subtilis that carries a deletion in the sp beta-glta region of the chromosome.

TI  == survival and implantation of escherichia coli in the intestinal tract.
AB  == preliminary experiments established that a 0.5-ml inoculum that is introduced directly into the stomach of mice was cleared rapidly into the small intestine. bicarbonate buffer, but not skim milk, protected such an inoculum from stomach acid until at least 90% of it had entered the small intestine. passage and survival of various escherichia coli strains through the mouse gut were tested by introducing a buffered bacterial inoculum directly into the stomach, together with the following two intestinal tracers: cr(51)cl(3) and spores of a thermophilic bacillus sp. quantitative recovery of excreted bacteria was accomplished by collecting the feces overnight in a refrigerated cage pan. the data show that wild-type e. coli strains and e. coli k-12 are excreted rapidly (98 to 100% within 18 h) in the feces without overall multiplication or death. e. coli varkappa1776 and dp50supf, i.e., strains certified for recombinant dna experiments underwent rapid death in vivo, such that their excretion in the feces was reduced to approximately 1.1 and 4.7% of the inoculum, respectively. the acidity of the stomach had little bactericidal effect on the e. coli k-12 strain  tested, but significantly reduced the survival of more acidsensitive bacteria (vibrio cholerae) under these conditions. long-term implantation of e. coli strains into continuous-flow cultures of mouse cecal flora or into conventional mice was difficult to accomplish. in contrast, when the e. coli strain was first  inoculated into sterile continuous-flow cultures or into germfree mice, which were subsequently associated with conventional mouse cecal flora, the e. coli strains persisted in a large proportion of the animals at levels resembling e. coli populations in conventional mice. metabolic adaptation contributed only partially to the success of an e. coli inoculum that was introduced first. a mathematical model is described which explains this phenomenon on the basis of competition for adhesion sites in which an advantage accrues to the bacterium which occupies those sites first. the mathematical model predicts that two or more bacterial strains that compete in the gut for the same limiting nutrient can coexist, if the metabolically less efficient strains have specific adhesion sites available. the specific rate constant of e. coli growth in monoassociated gnotobiotic mice was 2.0 h(-1), whereas the excretion rate in conventional animals was -0.23 h(-1). consequently, limitation of growth must be regarded as the primary mechanism controlling bacterial populations in the large intestine. the beginnings of a general hypothesis of the ecology of the large intestine are  proposed, in which the effects of the competitive metabolic interactions described earlier are modified by the effects of bacterial association with the intestinal wall.

AB  == two distinctly different glutamine synthetase enzymes (ei and eii) have been isolated from the extreme thermophile bacillus caldolyticus, grown on chemically  defined medium at 70 degrees c. purification to homogeneity mainly involves affinity chromatography and heat treatment with substrate protection. biosynthesis of total enzyme activity can be repressed by at least 8-fold by high ammonia, with synthesis of ei being repressed more strongly than eii. a variety of chemical and biochemical tests failed to provide evidence for regulation of ei or eii by covalent modification, e.g. proteolysis, phosphorylation, or adenylylation. neither of the thermophiic enzymes will cross-react with antibodies for the escherichia coli or bacillus subtilis glutamine synthetases. both enzymes are composed of 12 subunits, each approximately 51,000 daltons. however, ei and eii differ significantly in their amino acid composition, isoelectric points (5.2 and 5.5, respectively), rates of migration on polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels at ph 6.8, and kinetic properties, ei is more active with mg(ii) than with mn(ii), but eii is more active with mn(ii) than mg(ii). cd(ii) activates eii more than ei, and only ei shows activity with co(ii). for both enzymes, the mn(ii)-stimulated activity is optimal at ph 6.0 to  6.5, with mn(ii)/atp = 1.0, but the ph optimum with mg(ii) is near ph 7.5, however, with a ratio of mg(ii)/atp > 2. substrate km values at 70 degrees c differ for ei versus eii but are quite comparable to those seen for mesophilic glutamine synthetases. studies with structural analogs of substrates indicate that active site specificity is maintained at extreme temperatures: substitution  of alpha-oh for alpha-hn2 is allowed, but unfavorable changes occur upon substitution of methyl groups for the alpha-h or onto the alpha-nh2 of l-glu, and for d-glu or l-asp. eii is almost absdolutely specific for atp, but ei can also use itp, gtp, and utp as substrates to some extent. the divalent metal ion that is present can affect both specificity for analogs and substrate km values. kinetic binding plots (v versus [s]) are biphasic for nh3 and l-glu with the more active forms of each enzyme, ei-mg and eii-mn, respectively; but no positive cooperativity is observed. atp binding is strictly hyperbolic, in contrast to the positive cooperativity previously observed with other bacillus sp. enzymes. for purified ei and eii, arrhenius plots are nonlinear with mn(ii) or mg(ii), exhibiting slope changes in the range of 55-65 degrees c; however, for ei-eii mixtures in crude cell extracts these plots are nearly linear.

TI  == the site of inhibition of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis by azureomycin b, a new antibiotic.
AB  == azureomycin b (10 micrograms/ml), a new antibiotic from pseudonocardia azurea nov. sp., caused the accumulation of lipid intermediate and inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in an invitro system using a particulate fraction from bacillus megaterium km with udp-murnac-[3h]pentapeptide and cold udp-glcnac or cold udp-murnac-pentapeptide and udp-[3h]glcnac as substrates. at higher concentrations of azureomycin b (over 100 microgram/ml), lipid intermediate accumulation was also inhibited. when particulate fraction from escherichia coli  y-10 and udp-[14c[glcnac and cold udp-murnac-pentapeptide were used, accumulation of lipid intermediate and inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis were also observed. these results indicate that the primary target of azureomycin b is the  transfer of the disaccharide peptide unit (glcnac-murnac-pentapeptide) from lipid-bound precursor to acceptor.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

AB  == microorganisms able to form l-cysteine from dl-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (dl-atc), a chemical intermediate  in the synthesis of dl-cysteine, were isolated from soil samples and classified as pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas cohaerens, p. desmolytica, and p. ovalis. thirteen l-cysteine-producing bacteria were also found in among 463 stock cultures representing 37 genera. these were achromobacter delmarvae. alcaligenes  denitrificans, bacillus brevis, brevibacterium flavum, enterobacter aerogenes, erwinia carotovora, escherichia coli, micrococcus sodonensis, myocoplana dimorpha, sarcina lutea, serratia marcescens, flavobacterium acidoficum, and pseudomonas ovalis. in the presence of intact cells of pseudomonas sp. aj 3854, 6.1 mg of l-cysteine and/or l-cystine per ml was produced from 10 mg of dl-atc-3h2o per ml in a molar yield of 100%. this finding suggests that racemization and asymmetric hydrolysis occurred simultaneously in this incubation mixture. after the complete oxidation of cysteine to cystine by aeration in the presence of ferrous ion, crystalline cystine was isolated; its configuration was  the l isomer based on data from x-ray diffraction, microbioassay, and optical rotation studies.

TI  == a simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.

TI  == comparison of acetohydroxy-acid synthetases from two extreme thermophilic bacteria.
AB  == the acetohydroxy-acid synthetases from two extreme bacterial thermophiles, thermus aquaticus and bacillus sp., have been studied. the two enzymes have different ph optima, 8 and 6, respectively, and both are feedback inhibited by valine. the inhibition is of interest because it is not expressed below 60 c, but only at higher temperatures which are optimal for catalytic activity. valine inhibition in t. aquaticus was noncompetitive, whereas in bacillus sp., it was competitive. isoleucine (10(-3) m) also inhibited the two enzymes, whereas leucine (10(-3) m) did not. there was no concerted feedback when the amino acids  were added in together. the sensitivity of the enzymes to valine could not be removed by hgcl(2). both enzymes required mg(2+) and thiamine pyrophosphate for optimal activity, whereas only the enzyme from t. aquaticus required flavine adenine dinucleotide in addition. none of these cofactors was essential for the feedback inhibition caused by valine. the enzymes from both bacteria could be repressed, but only in the presence of all three branched-chain amino acids indicating that, as in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, the repression system is multivalent.

TI  == inhibition of the plaquing efficiency of t4r+ bacteriophage by subtilisin.
AB  == the mechanism by which the replicative cycle of t4r(+) phage is inhibited by certain nonhost bacterial systems was investigated. some bacillaceae, especially  bacillus subtilis, decreased the plaquing efficiency of this virus more than 95%  within 24 hr of exposure. sarcina lutea and micrococcus sp. both failed to cause  any significant change in the infectivity of t4r(+) phage. preliminary investigations into the nature of the inhibitory substance(s) suggested that an extracellularly elicited protein was at least partially responsible for this effect. further analysis has implicated subtilisin, an exoprotease from b. subtilis, as the cause of some, if not all, of the observed decrease in plaquing  efficiency. gel-filtration chromatography of control and treated (14)c-labeled t4r(+) phage showed a wide dispersal of phage-specific material of these particles after 24 hr of exposure to pure subtilisin or to expended medium exoprotease from b. subtilis. it was concluded that b. subtilis exoprotease is capable of chemically altering the structure of the phage capsid, thus causing a  decrease in its plaquing efficiency.
