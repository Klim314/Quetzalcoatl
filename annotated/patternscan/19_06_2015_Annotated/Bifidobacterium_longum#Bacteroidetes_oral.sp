TI  == stool microbiota and vaccine responses of infants.
AB  == objective: oral vaccine efficacy is low in less-developed countries, perhaps due  to intestinal dysbiosis. this study determined if stool microbiota composition predicted infant oral and parenteral vaccine responses. methods: the stool microbiota of 48 bangladeshi infants was characterized at 6, 11, and 15 weeks of  age by amplification and sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna gene v4 region and by bifidobacterium-specific, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. responses to oral polio virus (opv), bacille calmette-guerin (bcg), tetanus toxoid (tt), and hepatitis b virus vaccines were measured at 15 weeks by using vaccine-specific t-cell proliferation for all vaccines, the delayed-type hypersensitivity skin-test response for bcg, and immunoglobulin g responses using the antibody in  lymphocyte supernatant method for opv, tt, and hepatitis b virus. thymic index (ti) was measured by ultrasound. results: actinobacteria (predominantly bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis) dominated the stool microbiota, with  proteobacteria and bacteroidetes increasing by 15 weeks. actinobacteria abundance was positively associated with t-cell responses to bcg, opv, and tt; with the delayed-type hypersensitivity response; with immunoglobulin g responses; and with ti. b longum subspecies infantis correlated positively with ti and several vaccine responses. bacterial diversity and abundance of enterobacteriales, pseudomonadales, and clostridiales were associated with neutrophilia and lower vaccine responses. conclusions: bifidobacterium predominance may enhance thymic development and responses to both oral and parenteral vaccines early in infancy,  whereas deviation from this pattern, resulting in greater bacterial diversity, may cause systemic inflammation (neutrophilia) and lower vaccine responses. vaccine responsiveness may be improved by promoting intestinal bifidobacteria and minimizing dysbiosis early in infancy.

TI  == effect of the oral intake of yogurt containing bifidobacterium longum bb536 on the cell numbers of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in microbiota.
AB  == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains have been suggested to be associated with acute and persistent diarrheal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, although further epidemiological studies are needed for clarification. here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the  cell numbers of fecal etbf in a healthy population. among 420 healthy adults, 38  subjects were found to be etbf carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9%. among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, bifidobacterium longum bb536 (bb536y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group (milk group). the cell numbers of etbf and the dominant species of the b. fragilis group were measured by a quantitative pcr method. compared with the baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of etbf at week 8 in the bb536y group but not in the milk group. linear mixed models analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes of etbf cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase. these results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating etbf in the microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future. this is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on etbf in the  microbiota.

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium longum on human fecal microflora.
AB  == the effects of bifidobacterium longum feedings for five weeks on the fecal microflora, water contents, ph values, ammonia concentration, and beta-glucuronidase activity were investigated in five healthy human volunteers. although numbers of major bacterial groups of the fecal microflora were not changed by the bifidobacteria feedings, a remarkably decreasing number of lecithinase-negative clostridia was observed. the percentage of lecithinase-negative clostridia and bacteroides to the total bacterial numbers isolated were decreased during the feedings and numbers of c. paraputrificum and  c. innocuum were reduced. a significant reduction of fecal ph values for the last week of the feeding was observed. ammonia concentration and beta-glucuronidase activity in the feces during the feedings were significantly lower than those before or after the feedings. the oral supplement of b. longum may be introduced  to improve the fecal properties such as fecal ammonia concentration and beta-glucuronidase activity, but not the composition of fecal flora.
