TI  == a universal mariner transposon system for forward genetic studies in the genus clostridium.
AB  == dna transposons represent an essential tool in the armoury of the molecular microbiologist. we previously developed a catp-based mini transposon system for clostridium difficile in which the expression of the transposase gene was dependent on a sigma factor unique to c. difficile, tcdr. here we have shown that the host range of the transposon is easily extended through the rapid chromosomal insertion of the tcdr gene at the pyre locus of the intended clostridial target using allele-coupled exchange (ace). to increase the effectiveness of the system, a novel replicon conditional for plasmid maintenance was developed, which no longer supports the effective retention of the transposon delivery vehicle in the presence of the inducer isopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg). as a consequence, those thiamphenicol resistant colonies that arise in clostridial recipients, following plating on agar medium supplemented with iptg, are almost exclusively due to insertion of the mini transposon into the genome. the system has been exemplified in both clostridium acetobutylicum and clostridium sporogenes, where transposon insertion has been shown to be entirely random. moreover, appropriate screening of both libraries resulted in the isolation of auxotrophic mutants as well as cells deficient in spore formation/germination. this strategy is capable of being implemented in any clostridium species.

TI  == automated 3d rna structure prediction using the rnacomposer method for riboswitches.
AB  == understanding the numerous functions of rnas depends critically on the knowledge  of their three-dimensional (3d) structure. in contrast to the protein field, a much smaller number of rna 3d structures have been assessed using x-ray crystallography, nmr spectroscopy, and cryomicroscopy. this has led to a great demand to obtain the rna 3d structures using prediction methods. the 3d structure prediction, especially of large rnas, still remains a significant challenge and there is still a great demand for high-resolution structure prediction methods. in this chapter, we describe rnacomposer, a method and server for the automated prediction of rna 3d structures based on the knowledge of secondary structure. its applications are supported by other automated servers: rna frabase and rnapdbee, developed to search and analyze secondary and 3d structures. another method, rnalyzer, offers new way to analyze and visualize quality of rna 3d models. scope and limitations of rnacomposer in application for an automated prediction of riboswitches' 3d structure will be presented and discussed. analysis of the cyclic di-gmp-ii riboswitch from clostridium acetobutylicum (pdb  id 3q3z) as an example allows for 3d structure prediction of related riboswitches from clostridium difficile 4, bacillus halodurans 1, and thermus aquaticus y5.1 of yet unknown structures.

TI  == diverse mechanisms regulate sporulation sigma factor activity in the firmicutes.
AB  == sporulation allows bacteria to survive adverse conditions and is essential to the lifecycle of some obligate anaerobes. in bacillus subtilis, the sporulation-specific sigma factors, sigma(f), sigma(e), sigma(g), and sigma(k), activate compartment-specific transcriptional programs that drive sporulation through its morphological stages. the regulation of these sigma factors was predicted to be conserved across the firmicutes, since the regulatory proteins controlling their activation are largely conserved. however, recent studies in (pepto)clostridium difficile, clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum have revealed striking differences in the  order, activation, and function of sporulation sigma factors. these studies indicate that gene conservation does not necessarily predict gene function and that new mechanisms for controlling cell fate determination remain to be discovered in the anaerobic clostridia.

TI  == genomic sequence of bacteriophage atcc 8074-b1 and activity of its endolysin and  engineered variants against clostridium sporogenes.
AB  == lytic bacteriophage atcc 8074-b1 produces large plaques on its host clostridium sporogenes. sequencing of the 47,595-bp genome allowed the identification of 82 putative open reading frames, including those encoding proteins for head and tail morphogenesis and lysis. however, sequences commonly associated with lysogeny were absent. orf 22 encodes an endolysin, cs74l, that shows homology to n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, and when expressed in escherichia coli, the  protein causes effective lysis of c. sporogenes cells when added externally. cs74l was also active on clostridium tyrobutyricum and clostridium acetobutylicum. the catalytic domain expressed alone (cs74l(1-177)) exhibited a similar activity and the same host range as the full-length endolysin. a chimeric endolysin consisting of the cs74l catalytic domain fused to the c-terminal domain of endolysin cd27l, derived from clostridium difficile bacteriophage phicd27, was produced. this chimera (cscd) lysed c. sporogenes cells with an activity equivalent to that of the catalytic domain alone. in contrast, the cd27l c-terminal domain reduced the efficacy of the cs74l catalytic domain when tested  against c. tyrobutyricum. the addition of the cd27l c-terminal domain did not enable the lysin to target c. difficile or other cd27l-sensitive bacteria.

TI  == effects of different replicons in conjugative plasmids on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression and n-butanol biosynthesis in clostridium tyrobutyricum.
AB  == clostridium tyrobutyricum atcc 25755 can produce butyric acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen as the main products from various carbon sources. in this study, c. tyrobutyricum was used as a host to produce n-butanol by expressing adhe2 gene under the control of a native thiolase promoter using four different conjugative  plasmids (pmtl82151, 83151, 84151, and 85151) each with a different replicon (pbp1 from c. botulinum nctc2916, pcb102 from c. butyricum, pcd6 from clostridium difficile, and pim13 from bacillus subtilis). the effects of different replicons  on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, adhe2 expression and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase activities, and butanol production by different mutants of c. tyrobutyricum were investigated. among the four plasmids and replicons studied, pmtl82151 with pbp1 gave the highest transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression, and butanol biosynthesis. butanol production from various substrates, including glucose, xylose, mannose, and mannitol were then investigated with the best mutant strain harboring adhe2 in pmtl82151. a high butanol titer of 20.5 g/l with 0.33 g/g yield and 0.32 g/l h productivity was obtained with mannitol as the substrate in batch fermentation with ph controlled at ~6.0.

TI  == clostron-mediated engineering of clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium is a diverse assemblage of gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the  biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as clostridium  acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinkii, clostridium thermocellum, and clostridium phytofermentans. the prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. the historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies  for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by clostron technology. the clostron uses a retargeted group ii intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert dna into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo dna delivery. the procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.

TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.

TI  == clostron-targeted mutagenesis.
AB  == members of the genus clostridium have long been recognised as important to humankind and its animals, both in terms of the diseases they cause and the useful biological processes they undertake. this has led to increasing efforts directed at deriving greater information on their basic biology, most notably through genome sequence. accordingly, annotated sequences of all of the most important species are now available. however, full exploitation of the data generated has been hindered by the lack of mutational tools that may be used in functional genomic studies. thus, the number of clostridial mutants generated has until recently been disappointingly small. in particular, the construction of directed mutants using classical homologous recombination-based methods has met with only limited success. moreover, most of these few mutants were constructed by the unstable integration of a plasmid into the chromosome via a single crossover event. as an alternative, recombination-independent strategies have been devised that are reliant upon a re-targeted group ii intron. one element in  particular, the clostron, provides the facility for the positive selection of insertional mutants. the generation of mutants using the clostron is extremely rapid (as little as 10 days) and is highly efficient and reproducible. furthermore, the insertions made are extremely stable. its deployment has considerably expanded available options for clostridial functional genomic studies.

TI  == the clostron: mutagenesis in clostridium refined and streamlined.
AB  == the recent development of the clostron group ii intron directed mutagenesis tool  for clostridium has advanced genetics in this genus, and here we present several  significant improvements. we have shown how marker re-cycling can be used to construct strains with multiple mutations, demonstrated using flp/frt in clostridium acetobutylicum; tested the capacity of the system for the delivery of transgenes to the chromosome of clostridium sporogenes, which proved feasible for 1.0kbp transgenes in addition to a marker; and extended the host range of the system, constructing mutants in clostridium beijerinckii and, for the first time, in a b1/nap1/027 'epidemic' strain of clostridium difficile. automated intron design bioinformatics are now available free-of-charge at our website http://clostron.com; the out-sourced construction of re-targeted intron plasmids  has become cost-effective as well as rapid; and the combination of constitutive intron expression with direct selection for intron insertions has made mutant isolation trivial. these developments mean mutants can now be constructed with very little time and effort for the researcher. those who prefer to construct plasmids in-house are no longer reliant on a commercial kit, as a mixture of two  new plasmids provides unlimited template for intron re-targeting by splicing by overlap extension (soe) pcr. the new clostron plasmids also offer blue-white screening and other options for identification of recombinant plasmids. the improved clostron system supersedes the prototype plasmid pmtl007 and the original method, and exploits the potential of group ii introns more fully.

TI  == the clostron: a universal gene knock-out system for the genus clostridium.
AB  == progress in exploiting clostridial genome information has been severely impeded by a general lack of effective methods for the directed inactivation of specific  genes. those few mutants that have been generated have been almost exclusively derived by single crossover integration of a replication-deficient or defective plasmid by homologous recombination. the mutants created are therefore unstable.  here we have adapted a mutagenesis system based on the mobile group ii intron from the ltrb gene of lactococcus lactis (ll.ltrb) to function in clostridial hosts. integrants are readily selected on the basis of acquisition of resistance  to erythromycin, and are generated from start to finish in as little as 10 to 14  days. unlike single crossover plasmid integrants, the mutants are extremely stable. the system has been used to make 6 mutants of clostridium acetobutylicum  and 5 of clostridium difficile, exceeding the number of published mutants ever generated in these species. genes have also been inactivated for the first time in clostridium botulinum and clostridium sporogenes, suggesting the system will be universally applicable to the genus. the procedure is highly efficient and reproducible, and should revolutionize functional genomic studies in clostridia.

TI  == complementation of a clostridium perfringens spo0a mutant with wild-type spo0a from other clostridium species.
AB  == to evaluate whether c. perfringens can be used as a model organism for studying the sporulation process in other clostridia, c. perfringens spo0a mutant ih101 was complemented with wild-type spo0a from four different clostridium species. wild-type spo0a from c. acetobutylicum or c. tetani, but not from c. botulinum or c. difficile, restored sporulation and enterotoxin production in ih101. the ability of spo0a from c. botulinum or c. difficile to complement the lack of spore formation in ih101 might be due, at least in part, to the low levels of spo0a transcription and spo0a production.

TI  == insights in metabolism and toxin production from the complete genome sequence of  clostridium tetani.
AB  == the decryption of prokaryotic genome sequences progresses rapidly and provides the scientific community with an enormous amount of information. clostridial genome sequencing projects have been finished only recently, starting with the genome of the solvent-producing clostridium acetobutylicum in 2001. a lot of attention has been devoted to the genomes of pathogenic clostridia. in 2002, the  genome sequence of c. perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene, has been  released. currently in the finishing stage and prior to publication are the genomes of the foodborne botulism-causing c. botulinum and of c. difficile, the causative agent of a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. our team sequenced the genome of neuropathogenic  c. tetani, a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium predominantly found in the soil. in deep wound infections it occasionally causes spastic paralysis in humans and vertebrate animals, known as tetanus disease, by the secretion of potent neurotoxin, designated tetanus toxin. the toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic membranes of interneurons of the spinal cord and the brainstem, thus preventing muscle relaxation. fortunately, this disease is successfully controlled through immunization with tetanus toxoid, a formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin, but nevertheless, an estimated 400,000 cases  still occur each year, mainly of neonatal tetanus. the world health organization  has stated that neonatal tetanus is the second leading cause of death from vaccine preventable diseases among children worldwide. this minireview focuses on an analysis of the genome sequence of c. tetani e88, a vaccine production strain, which is a toxigenic non-sporulating variant of strain massachusetts. the genome  consists of a 2,799,250 bp chromosome encoding 2618 open reading frames. the tetanus toxin is encoded on a 74,082 kb plasmid, containing 61 genes. additional  virulence-related factors as well as an insight into the metabolic strategy of c. tetani with regard to its pathogenic phenotype will be presented. the information from other clostridial genomes by means of comparative analysis will also be explored.

TI  == regulation of toxin and bacteriocin gene expression in clostridium by interchangeable rna polymerase sigma factors.
AB  == the production of major extracellular toxins by pathogenic strains of clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani and clostridium difficile, and a bacteriocin by clostridium perfringens is dependent on a related group of rna polymerase sigma-factors. these sigma-factors (botr, tetr, tcdr and uvia) were shown to be sufficiently similar that they could substitute for one another in in vitro dna binding and run-off transcription experiments. in cells, however, the sigma-factors fell into two subclasses. botr and tetr were able to direct transcription of their target genes in a fully reciprocal manner. similarly, uvia and tcdr were fully interchangeable. neither botr nor tetr could substitute for uvia or tcdr, however, and neither uvia nor tcdr could direct transcription of the natural targets of botr or tetr. the extent of functional interchangeability  of the sigma-factors was attributed to the strong conservation of their subregion 4.2 sequences and the conserved -35 sequences of their target promoters, while restrictions on interchangeability were attributed to variations in their subregion 2.4 sequences and the target site -10 sequences. the four sigma-factors have been assigned to group 5 of the sigma(70) family and seem to have arisen from a common ancestral protein that may have co-evolved with the genes whose transcription they direct. a fifth clostridiumsigma-factor, sigma(y) of clostridium acetobutylicum, resembles the tcdr family, but was not functionally interchangeable with members of this family.

TI  == toxins, butyric acid, and other short-chain fatty acids are coordinately expressed and down-regulated by cysteine in clostridium difficile.
AB  == it was recently found that a mixture of nine amino acids down-regulate clostridium difficile toxin production when added to peptone yeast extract (py) cultures of strain vpi 10463 (s. karlsson, l. g. burman, and t. akerlund, microbiology 145:1683-1693, 1999). in the present study, seven of these amino acids were found to exhibit a moderate suppression of toxin production, whereas proline and particularly cysteine had the greatest impact, on both reference strains (n = 6) and clinical isolates (n = 28) of c. difficile (>99% suppression  by cysteine in the highest toxin-producing strain). also, cysteine derivatives such as acetylcysteine, glutathione, and cystine effectively down-regulated toxin expression. an impact of both cysteine and cystine but not of thioglycolate on toxin yield indicated that toxin expression was not regulated by the oxidation-reduction potential. several metabolic pathways, including butyric acid and butanol production, were coinduced with the toxins in py and down-regulated by cysteine. the enzyme 3-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in solventogenesis in clostridium acetobutylicum, was among the most up-regulated proteins during high toxin production. the addition of butyric acid to various growth media induced toxin production, whereas the addition of butanol had the opposite effect. the results indicate a coupling between specific metabolic processes and toxin expression in c. difficile and that certain amino acids can alter these pathways coordinately. we speculate that down-regulation of toxin production by the administration of such amino acids to the colon may become a novel approach to prophylaxis and therapy for c. difficile-associated diarrhea.

TI  == tracking the evolution of the bacterial choline-binding domain: molecular characterization of the clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052 cspa gene.
AB  == the major secreted protein of clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052, a choline-containing strain, is cspa (clostridial secreted protein). it appears to  be a 115,000-m(r) glycoprotein that specifically recognizes the choline residues  of the cell wall. polyclonal antibodies raised against cspa detected the presence of the protein in the cell envelope and in the culture medium. the soluble cspa protein has been purified, and an oligonucleotide probe, prepared from the determined n-terminal sequence, has been used to clone the cspa gene which encodes a protein with 590 amino acids and an m(r) of 63,740. according to the predicted amino acid sequence, cspa is synthesized with an n-terminal segment of  26 amino acids characteristic of prokaryotic signal peptides. expression of the cspa gene in escherichia coli led to the production of a major anti-cspa-labeled  protein of 80,000 da which was purified by affinity chromatography on deae-cellulose. a comparison of cspa with other proteins in the embl database revealed that the c-terminal half of cspa is homologous to the choline-binding domains of the major pneumococcal autolysin (lyta amidase), the pneumococcal antigen pspa, and other cell wall-lytic enzymes of pneumococcal phages. this region, which is constructed of four repeating motifs, also displays a high similarity with the glucan-binding domains of several streptococcal glycosyltransferases and the toxins of clostridium difficile.

TI  == genes encoding homologues of three consecutive enzymes in the butyrate/butanol-producing pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum are clustered on the clostridium difficile chromosome.
AB  == screening of a clostridium difficile lambda embl3 gene library with antisera raised against c. difficile culture supernatant identified several clones expressing a 31-kda protein. a 1.8-kb hindiii fragment subcloned from one of the  clones was sufficient for expression of the 31-kda polypeptide. southern blot analysis showed a region homologous to this fragment to be present in all of 13 different c. difficile strains tested. sequence analysis of the 1.8-kb fragment revealed three adjacent open reading frames. a database search showed that these  three open reading frames appeared to encode homologues of three consecutive enzymes in the butanol/butyrate-producing pathway of clostridium acetobutylicum (crotonase, beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a dehydrogenase and thiolase).
