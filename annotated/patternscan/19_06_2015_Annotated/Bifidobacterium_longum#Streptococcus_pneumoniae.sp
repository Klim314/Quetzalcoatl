TI  == identification of a pneumococcal glycosidase that modifies o-linked glycans.
AB  == colonization of the airway by streptococcus pneumoniae is typically asymptomatic; however, progression of bacteria beyond the oronasopharynx can cause diseases including otitis media and pneumonia. the mechanisms by which s. pneumoniae establishes and maintains colonization remain poorly understood. both n-linked and o-linked glycans are abundant in the airway. our previous research demonstrated that s. pneumoniae can sequentially deglycosylate n-linked glycans and suggested that this modification of sugar structures may aid in colonization. there is published evidence that s. pneumoniae expresses a secreted o-glycosidase that cleaves galactose beta1-3 n-acetylgalactosamine (galbeta1-3galnac) from core-1 o-linked glycans; however, the biological function of this enzyme has not  previously been determined. we established that the activity is not secreted but  is instead surface associated in a sortase-dependent manner. genome analysis revealed an open reading frame predicted to encode a sortase-dependent surface protein with sequence similarity to the o-glycosidase of bifidobacterium longum.  deletion of this pneumococcal open reading frame confirmed that this gene encodes an o-glycosidase. experiments using a model glycoconjugate demonstrated that this o-glycosidase, together with the neuraminidase nana, is required for s. pneumoniae to cleave sialylated core-1 o-linked glycans. the ability of the o-glycosidase mutant to cleave this glycan structure was restored by both genetic complementation and the addition of o-glycosidase. the mutant showed a reduction  in adherence to human airway epithelial cells and a significantly decreased ability to colonize the upper respiratory tract, suggesting that cleavage of core-1 o-linked glycans enhances the ability of s. pneumoniae to colonize the human airway.

TI  == identification and molecular cloning of a novel glycoside hydrolase family of core 1 type o-glycan-specific endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == we found endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase in most bifidobacterial strains, which are predominant bacteria in the human colon. this enzyme catalyzes the liberation of galactosyl beta1,3-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galbeta1,3galnac) alpha-linked to serine or threonine residues from mucin-type glycoproteins. the gene (engbf) encoding the enzyme has been cloned from bifidobacterium longum jcm  1217. the protein consisted of 1,966 amino acid residues, and the central domain  (590-1381 amino acid residues) exhibited 31-53% identity to hypothetical proteins of several bacteria including clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pneumoniae. the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli liberated galbeta1,3galnac disaccharide from galbeta1,3galnacalpha1pnp and asialofetuin, but did not release galnac, galbeta1,3(glcnacbeta1,6)galnac, glcnacbeta1,3galnac, and galbeta1,3glcnac from each p-nitrophenyl (pnp) substrate, and also did not release sialo-oligosaccharides from fetuin, indicating its strict substrate specificity for the core 1-type structure. the stereochemical course of hydrolysis was determined by (1)h nmr and was found to be retention. site-directed mutagenesis of a total of 22 conserved asp and glu residues suggested that asp-682 and asp-789 are critical residues for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. the enzyme also exhibited transglycosylation activity toward various mono- and disaccharides and 1-alkanols, demonstrating its potential to synthesize neoglycoconjugates. this is the first report for the isolation of a gene encoding endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase from any organisms and for the establishment of a new glycoside hydrolase family (gh family 101).

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
