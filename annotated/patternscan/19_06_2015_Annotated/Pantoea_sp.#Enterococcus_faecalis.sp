TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
