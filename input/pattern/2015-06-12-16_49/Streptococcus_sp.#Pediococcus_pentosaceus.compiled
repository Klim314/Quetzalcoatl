TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - The dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of Obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - Obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from Uganda namely: Obutoko, Enturire, Ekitiribita and Obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. Knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. Culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and mixed DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified ribosomal RNA genes were used to study the bacteria and yeast diversity of Obushera. The pH dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire whereas that of Ekitiribita decreased to 4.4 after 4 days. Counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. LAB and yeast isolates were identified by rRNA gene sequence analysis. LAB isolates included: Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus (S.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weisella (W.) confusa. DGGE indicated predominance of S. gallolyticus, S. infantarius subsp. infantarius, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, W. confusa, Lb. reuteri, Fructobacillus spp., L. lactis and L. lactis. Yeast isolates included Clavispora lusitaniae, Cyberlindnera fabianii, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DGGE indicated predominance of S. cerevisiae in Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and also detected Pichia spp. and I. orientalis in Obutoko. Obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and later by Lactococcus spp. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp. were also detected in Ekitiribita. Development of starters for Obushera may require combinations of LAB and S. cerevisiae for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and LAB for Ekitiribita.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Thai oral streptococci, lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  - This work was to assess the isolation and identification of Thai oral bacteria. Seventeen viridans group streptococci (VGS) and seventeen lactic acid bacteria from saliva were characterization based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and the 16S RNA gene sequences analysis. The Gram-positive cocci in chains of viridans group comprised of six isolates (Group I) were identified as Streptococcus gordonii, 6 isolates (Group II) were Streptococcus salivarius, 4 isolates (Group III) were Streptococcus sanguis and one isolate (Group IV) was Streptococcus mutans. Seventeen lactic acid bacterial isolates were Gram-positive and catalase negative. They did not contained diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. They were divided into four groups, the rod-shaped in Group A (11 isolates) and Group B (2 isolates) which were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus salivarius, respectively. The tetrad-forming cocci in Group C (3 isolates) and Group D (1 isolate) were identified as Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus, respectively.
TI  - Molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. Study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. To achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional African fermented cereal foods. A total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from Northern and Southern geographical region of Nigeria. They were identified using combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on rpoA, pheS and atpA genes as well as M13-PCR gel fingerprints. The results showed that Lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). Other species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) identified were Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the Bacillus and Staphylococcus. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis of the M13-PCR fingerprints for LAB strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. In vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic L. plantarum ULAG11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - The spatial distribution of bacteria in Grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  - The microbial composition and its spatial distribution of Grana Trentino, a hard  Parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. After cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and the cheese core. After two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. Milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic bacterial counts. Thermophilic bacteria (Lactobacillus helveticus) were found in high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. After 9 months of ripening, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts were higher than those after 18 months. Furthermore, the LAB numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. The main LAB species isolated from milk (Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Streptococcus uberis and Lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. Some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. Microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of LAB. In each sample, all LAB were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter LAB (NSLAB) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of Grana Trentino cheese.
TI  - Detection and characterization of pediocin PA-1/AcH like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from seven different sources. Eight isolates were found to produce pediocin PA-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedB gene PCR and dot-blot hybridization. The culture filtrate (CF) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and LAB. The identification and genetic diversity among the selected LAB was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like RFLP, RAPD, and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The isolates were identified as, 1 each of Pediococcus acidilactici Cb1, Lactobacillus plantarum Acr2, and Streptococcus equinus AC1, 2 were of P. pentosaceus Cb4 and R38, and other 3 were Enterococcus faecium Acr4, BL1, V3. Partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline pH, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kDa and shared the properties of class IIa pediocin-family. The bacteriocin production at different temperatures, pH, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. Diversity of RAPD types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical transfer of intestinal LAB from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.
TI  - Comparison of culture-dependent and -independent methods for bacterial community  monitoring during Montasio cheese manufacturing.
AB  - The microbial community in milk is of great importance in the manufacture of traditional cheeses produced using raw milk and natural cultures. During milk curdling and cheese ripening, complex interactions occur in the microbial community, and accurate identification of the microorganisms involved provides essential information for understanding their role in these processes and in flavor production. Recent improvements in molecular biological methods have led to their application to food matrices, and thereby opened new perspectives for the study of microbial communities in fermented foods. In this study, a description of microbial community composition during the manufacture and ripening of Montasio cheese was provided. A combined approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods was applied. Culture-dependent identification was compared with 16S clone libraries sequencing data obtained from both DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA (cDNA) amplification and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays developed to detect and quantify specific bacterial species/genera (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp.). S. thermophilus was the predominant LAB species throughout the entire ripening period of Montasio cheese. The culture-independent method demonstrates the relevant presence of Pseudomonas spp. and Lactococcus piscium at the beginning of ripening. The culture-dependent approach and the two culture-independent approaches produced complementary information, together generating a general view of cheese microbial ecology.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria associated with the production of plaa-som, a traditional fermented fish product of Thailand.
AB  - Plaa-som is a Thai fermented fish product for which whole fish or fish fillets are fermented with either cooked rice or steamed sticky rice, salt, and garlic. A total of 762 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated during plaa-som fermentation by culture on CaCO(3)-MRS agar plates. They were screened and grouped by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), giving six groups that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus bovis, Weissella cibaria, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus fermentum. Freshly mixed ingredients contained low populations of LAB (less than 10 CFU/g) that subsequently grew during fermentation to final populations of approximately 10(7)CFU/g. Early stages of the process were dominated by the presence of Lc. garvieae, S. bovis, and W. cibaria. At 48 h into fermentation, W. cibaria, P. pentosaceus, and Lb. plantarum were prevalent, and gave way to a dominance of Lb. plantarum that completed the fermentation. A mixture of these LAB species could be considered as species for development of a starter culture for plaa-som fermentation.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Method for reliable isolation of Lactobacillus sakei strains originating from Tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  - In Tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. Such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. We isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of Tunisia, and selectively searched for Lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. Eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. Several methods were used in order to develop a rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of L. sakei. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. Search for the presence of the L. sakei specific katA gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ARDRA group. Sequencing of 16S rDNA confirmed those isolates as L. sakei. Those 22 different L. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ARDRA groups were tentatively ascribed to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis/garviae, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus parauberis, Hafnia alvei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus curvatus through 16S rDNA sequencing. A fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate L. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - The gram-positive tonsillar and nasal flora of piglets before and after weaning.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate gram-positive nasal and tonsillar microbial flora of piglets before and after weaning. METHODS AND RESULTS: The nasal and tonsillar gram-positive bacterial flora of 20 non-weaned piglets (2 weeks of age) and 20 weaned piglets (6 weeks of age), obtained from four different piggeries, was quantified by culture and identified by tDNA-PCR. The most widely occurring species from nasal conchae before as well as after weaning in the different piglets investigated were Streptococcus suis and Rothia nasimurium. After weaning a wide variety of Lactobacillus species appeared but in low numbers. In the tonsils, Strep. suis, Strep. dysgalactiae, S. hyicus, S. aureus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Actinomyces hyovaginalis were the species isolated from the largest number of pigs before and after weaning. S. aureus and most lactobacilli became more prevalent after weaning. Bacteria not known to be associated with pigs found in the present study included R. nasimurium, Strep. gallolyticus, Pediococcus pentosaceus and some Lactobacillus species. CONCLUSIONS: Over 30 different gram-positive bacterial species may occur in nasal conchae and tonsils of unweaned piglets at 2 weeks of age and of 6-week-old weaned piglets. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated that weaning is associated with changes in prevalence of only a small minority of the highly diversified bacterial flora of the nares and tonsils of pigs.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  - When Lactic Acid Bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees C for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees C for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and Pediococcus pentosaceus PO2 (18%), but not for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of Lactobacillus helveticus LB1 and Streptococcus thermophilus TS2. When the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. Use of degenerate PCR primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis resulted in PCR products from all strains tested. The PCR product from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis M474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. Use of PCR primers based on the M474 sequence resulted in PCR products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not from the Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, or Pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.
TI  - The effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - beta-Galactosidases from Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, Lb. casei 20094, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, Streptococcus thermophilus TS2, Pediococcus pentosaceus PE39 and Bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. The rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by Mg2+, while the effect of K+ and Na+ differed from strain to strain. The beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. The types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in each case, but the rates of their production differed. All the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, Lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.
TI  - Development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  - Bacteriophages against Streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the Italian cheese industry. One possible control method involves replacing S. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. In this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. Because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 25744, P. pentosaceus ATCC 25745, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 12697 by electroporation with pPN-1, a 35-kb Lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. Transformants of P. pentosaceus ATCC 25745 and P. acidilactici ATCC 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. Both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained pPN-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. Paired starter combinations of Pediococcus spp. and Lactobacillus helveticus LH100 exhibited synergistic pH reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. Results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for S. thermophilus in Italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat S. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plantaricin SIK-83, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum SIK-83 produces a bacteriocin, designated plantaricin SIK-83, which inhibits 66 of 68 lactic acid bacteria from the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Streptococcus. A 500-fold dilution of L. plantarum SIK-83 MRS culture supernatant with phosphate buffer was sufficient to kill 10(5) cells/ml of Pediococcus pentosaceus within 120 s. The killing of a sensitive population followed exponential kinetics. It was shown that the bacteriocin binds specifically to sensitive cells but not to nonsensitive lactic acid bacteria, the producer strain or Gram-negative bacteria. Sensitive cells, after exposure to the bacteriocin, could be rescued by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. In buffer, plantaricin SIK-83 was adsorbed to the cell surface almost immediately, and morphological lesions were observed within 2 h after the cells were exposed to the bacteriocin. The lethal mode of action appeared to be due to damage to the cell membrane, resulting in cell lysis, which was detected by electron microscopy and by determination of released intracellular components.
TI  - Association of a 13.6-Megadalton Plasmid in Pediococcus pentosaceus with Bacteriocin Activity.
AB  - Pediococcus pentosaceus FBB61 and L7230, isolated from cucumber fermentations, produced a bacteriocin, designated pediocin A, which had identical activity spectra against species of Pediococcus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. Both strains possessed a 13.6-megadalton plasmid (pMD136). Plasmid curing experiments suggested that both bacteriocin immunity and production determinants were encoded by pMD136. Use of pediocin-producing strains in food fermentations is discussed.
TI  - A numerical taxonomic study of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum-packed beef, pork, lamb and bacon.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study using 79 unit characters has been performed on 100 isolates of lactic acid bacteria from refrigerated vacuum-packed beef, pork, lamb and bacon. Three clusters were observed at 78% S which contained all the strains apart from three unidentifiable streptobacteria, one Leuconostoc, and one strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus. One cluster (III) consisted of only one strain of Leuc. paramesenteroides and six unidentifiable Leuconostoc strains. The two largest clusters (I and II) were both composed entirely of streptobacteria. Cluster I contained 31 strains (G + C content 33.2-36.9 moles%) which were not identifiable with any described species. Cluster II contained 57 strains (G + C content 40.7-43.7 moles %) which were provisionally identified with Lactobacillus sake or Lact. bavaricus according to the lactic acid isomer produced. The division of nearly all the streptobacteria into two clearly defined clusters has resolved problems which have existed in the classification of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum-packed meat.
TI  - Plasmid transfer in Pediococcus spp.: intergeneric and intrageneric transfer of pIP501.
AB  - Transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus faecalis to Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici occurred between cells immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of DNase. Expression of the pIP501-linked erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was observed in transconjugants. Intrageneric transfer of pIP501 from a P. pentosaceus donor to various pediococcal recipients occurred at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. Intergeneric transfer of plasmid pIP501 from P. pentosaceus to S. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis (Challis), and Streptococcus lactis was observed. Similar mating experiments showed no evidence for the transfer of the broad-host-range R-plasmid pAM beta 1 to Pediococcus spp. recipients.
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
