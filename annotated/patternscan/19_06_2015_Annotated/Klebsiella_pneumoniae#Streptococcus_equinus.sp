TI  == [recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: the bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  == introduction: recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. the causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. patients and  methods: retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. results: case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) after 2 episodes of haemophilus influenzae meningitis. surgical repair after third recurrence. case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by mri with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae. ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. case 3: girl with meningitis due to staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. mri shows occipital dermal sinus  requiring excision. complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. case 4: child with meningitis due to streptococcus bovis at 9 days and enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to citrobacter freundii and e. faecium later on. spinal mri led to the diagnosis of currarino syndrome with csf fistula, which was surgically repaired. the 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. conclusions: in patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. the isolated microorganism should help to locate it. it is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. the definitive treatment is usually surgical.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of mycobacterium bovis.
AB  == bovine tuberculosis caused by mycobacterium bovis is an important zoonosis. in this study, a simple, rapid method for detecting this organism was developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification of the mpt83 gene. the technique  will be of value in the clinical and field-based diagnosis of m. bovis and can differentiate it from other bacteria such as corynebacterium diphtheriae, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the limit of detection was 10 copies/mul and the results were corroborated by pcr. the method was highly specific and more sensitive than pcr.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (mdr) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (mdr) strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. atcc strains of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus bovis, pseudimonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans were also tested. the strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. the mdr strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of acacia nilotica,  syzygium aromaticum and cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of terminalia arjuna and eucalyptus globulus. community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. the most potent antimicrobial plant was a. nilotica (mic range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher mic values than a. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. this study concludes  that a. nilotica, c. zeylanicum and s. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  == recurrent klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in a diabetic patient followed by streptococcus bovis endocarditis--occult colon tumor plays an important role.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae is the leading cause of liver abscess in diabetic patients  in taiwan. we report the case of a diabetic patient with a history of four episodes of k. pneumoniae liver abscess within 3 years. the patient later developed streptococcus bovis bacteremia originating from a colon tumor with complications of endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and silent splenic abscess. occult  colon tumor may have played an important role in our case, with recurrent infection arising from colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract. as our case shows, the possible association between occult colon tumor and k. pneumoniae liver abscess in diabetic patients should be surveyed.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6r, 7r)-7-[[(z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1h-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with  those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. fk-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. of 98 isolates of  homogenous methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of fk-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. the mic of fk-037 for 90% of the strains tested (mic90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci,  streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus bovis. the mic90 for many of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. the mic90 for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. k. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime mics of > 32 micrograms/ml with bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of fk-037 per ml. e. cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and s. aureus stably resistant to fk-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of fk-037. the fk-037 mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. xanthomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter anitratus, and bacteroides species were resistant to fk-037 (mic, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). mbcs were identical to or within twofold of  the mics except for a 32-fold greater mbc for p. aeruginosa. inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of fk-037. fk-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by  2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. nonetheless, fk-037 inhibited bacteria possessing tem-3, -5, and -7 and shv -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. overall, fk-037 has lower mics against staphylococci and p. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae  comparable to that of cefepime.

TI  == microflora of the pouch of the koala (phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  == microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. no microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of  17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including pseudomonas aeruginosa,  serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  patients with cirrhosis.
AB  == to determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females)  with 16 gram-negative infective episodes (12 escherichia coli and 4 klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. all organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal  syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; streptococcus  faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to streptococcus  equinus and streptococcus mutans in the other two. aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. a negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. the high mortality rate was attributable to the  generally poor underlying condition of the patients.

TI  == intramammary infections in primigravid heifers near parturition.
AB  == mammary secretion from 32 primigravid heifers was obtained aseptically to determine frequency of bacterial isolation and incidence of intramammary infection near parturition. quarter samples were collected 14 and 7 days prior to expected parturition, at parturition, and 7 and 14 days postparturition. analysis of culture data indicated that 77.1% of samples were bacteriologically negative,  and 15.7% contained coagulase negative staphylococci, 4.4% streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, 3.8% coliforms, .8% coagulase positive staphylococci, and .1% corynebacterium bovis. frequency of bacterial isolation was highest in samples obtained prior to and at parturition. thirty-five of 128 quarters were infected at parturition. twenty-six of the 35 infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, 4 by streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, 4 by coliforms, and 1 by coagulase positive staphylococci. twenty infections were observed during the early postpartum period. coagulase negative staphylococcal infections decreased markedly. however, the number and type of primary pathogen infections during early lactation were similar to those at parturition.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
