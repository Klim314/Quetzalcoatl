TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == viral-bacterial associations in acute apical abscesses.
AB  == objective: viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. this study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. study design: dna extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical  abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach. single or nested pcr assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (hpv) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. results: two-thirds of the abscess samples  were positive for at least one of the target viruses. specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were hhv-8 (54.5%); hpv (9%); and varicella zoster virus (vzv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), and hhv-6 (6%). bacterial dna was present  in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were treponema denticola (70%), tannerella forsythia (67%), porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), dialister invisus (61%), and dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). hhv-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and hpv with 4, but all these associations were weak. several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. conclusions: findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral dna occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from  endodontic abscesses. although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == microorganisms in root canal-treated teeth from a german population.
AB  == posttreatment apical periodontitis is usually associated with persistent or secondary intraradicular infection. this study evaluated the presence and relative levels of 28 bacterial taxa in treated root canals of teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis from german patients using 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene probes in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was also performed to detect enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. bacterial dna was detected in all samples. twenty of the 28 taxon-specific probes tested were reactive with at least one sample. taxa detected more frequently included streptococcus species (47%), lactobacillus species (35%), dialister invisus (29%), eubacterium infirmum (29%), prevotella intermedia (29%), selenomonas sputigena (29%), synergistes oral clone ba121 (29%), and treponema denticola (29%). only eight taxa were present at levels >10(5). of these, streptococci and t. denticola were the most prevalent. species-specific pcr detected e. faecalis in 47% of the cases and c. albicans in  6%. findings of this study confirm the strong association between persistent/secondary intraradicular infection and posttreatment apical periodontitis. most cases harbored a mixed infection, and e. faecalis, if present, was never the most dominant species in the consortium. several other bacterial taxa were detected, and an involvement with the etiology of posttreatment apical periodontitis is suspected.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial named species and uncultivated phylotypes in endodontic abscesses from two geographic locations.
AB  == evidence is mounting that the prevalence of some putative endodontic pathogens can significantly vary according to the geographic location in which samples were taken. this study aimed to provide additional knowledge on this subject by comparing the frequencies of 10 selected candidate endodontic pathogens in samples of acute apical abscesses obtained from two distinct geographic locations; portland, or, and rio de janeiro, brazil. dna was extracted from aspirates and used as template in nested pcr assays using 16s rrna gene taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers. of the target species/phylotypes, treponema denticola (73% of the cases), porphyromonas endodontalis (70%), and tannerella forsythia (57%) were the most prevalent taxa found in brazilian samples. dialister invisus (70% of the cases), p. endodontalis (63%) and dialister pneumosintes (55%) were the most frequent taxa in the portland, or samples. data analysis revealed that t. denticola and t. forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in the portland, or samples. although d. invisus, filifactor alocis, and synergistes oral clone w090  were detected in many more samples from the portland, or patients, differences were not found to be statistically significant. these findings confirmed that some bacterial taxa can markedly differ in the frequencies they occur in samples  from different locations. it remains to be clarified whether this observation translates into relevant therapeutic implications.
