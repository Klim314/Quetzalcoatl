TI  - An in Vitro Experimental Study on the Antimicrobial Activity of Silicone Oil against Anaerobic Bacteria.
AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of silicone  oil against anaerobic agents, specifically Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Fuobacterium spp., and Clostridium tertium. Method: A 0.5 McFarland turbidity of Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Fuobacterium spp., and Clostridium tertium was prepared, and 0.1 mL was inoculated into 0.9 mL of silicone oil. Control inoculations were performed in anaerobic blood agar and fluid thioglycollate medium without silicone oil. Results: Propionibacterium acnes retained their viability on the 3rd day in the presence of silicone oil. In total, 9.7 x 106 colonies were enumerated from 1 mL of silicone oil. After a prolonged incubation of 7 days, the number of colonies observed was 9.2 x 106. The other bacteria disappeared after the 3rd day of incubation in silicone oil. Conclusions: Propionibacterium acnes, which is the most common chronic postoperative endophthalmitis agent, is thought to be resistant to silicone oil.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial efficacy of Metapex, Metronidazole, BioPure MTAD, Aztreonam on Bacteroides fragilis and Propionibacterium acne.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the comparative antibacterial efficacy of Biopure MTAD, Metapex, Metronidazole, and Aztreonam against two obligate anerobic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial efficacy of selected medicaments against two obligate anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis and Propionibacterium acnes was done by Agar disc-diffusion method. Pre-sterilized Whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar Petri plates. Each plate was incubated in anaerobic jar for anerobic environment at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. Saline and ethanol used as control group in this study. RESULTS: Biopure MTAD, Metapex and Metronidazole were effective against all the selected microorganisms. Aztreonam was effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Saline and ethanol used as control were ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Metronidazole showed the superior antibacterial property amongst the tested medicaments.
TI  - MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting facilitates rapid discrimination of phylotypes I, II  and III of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is widely used today for species determination of bacteria and fungi in routine microbiological laboratories, and can also be used for subtyping of bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis. Propionibacterium acnes is frequently referred to as an anaerobic skin commensal of relatively low pathogenicity. In addition to its accepted pathogenic role in acne, P. acnes is now emerging as an important opportunistic pathogen in many other clinical situations, including late-stage prosthetic joint infections, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, post-neurosurgical infections and possibly prostate cancer. At the population genetic level, P. acnes can be differentiated into a number of distinct phylogroups, known as types IA1, IA2, IB, IC, II and III, which may be associated with different types of infections and clinical conditions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate MS-based typing for resolution of these genetic groups after routine identification by MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker MALDI Biotyper). The software package ClinProTools 2.2 was used to analyze the protein based mass spectra of reference strains belonging to types IA, IB, IC, II and III. Phylogroup-specific peaks and peak shifts were then identified visually. In addition, peak variations between the different types of P. acnes were investigated by using FlexAnalysis 3.3 software (Bruker). A differentiating library was created, which was used to type further 48 clinical isolates of P. acnes. Typing data obtained by MALDI-TOF MS were then compared with the results from Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). Most of the clinical isolates (n = 19) belonged to the type IA grouping according to MALDI-TOF MS. By MLST, all isolates were identified as type IA1. Twenty-one clinical isolates belonged to the type IB cluster based on both MALDI-TOF MS and MLST typing. Eight clinical isolates were identified as type II strains by both typing methods and all the type III reference strains could be distinguished by the presence of a unique type III-specific peak (7238 Da) by the MALDI-TOF MS. Our study demonstrates that MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable and powerful tool for rapid identification and typing of P. acnes strains from the main genetic divisions of the species.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - [Role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  - According to the data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  at least 6 virus species (HPV, EBV, HHV-8/KSHV, HTLV-1, HBV, HCV), 4 helminthes species (Schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) and I bacterium species (Helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. The analysis of the data available shows that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), monkey virus 40 (SV40), cytomegalovirus (CMV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), Helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis and anginosus, Treponema denticola, Salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Propionibacterium acnes, Tropheryma whippelii, Schistosoma mansoni, Opistorchis felineus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia solium, Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. Apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.
TI  - Characteristics and outcome of 16 periprosthetic shoulder joint infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: Shoulder arthroplasties are increasingly performed, but data on periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) in this anatomical position are limited. We retrospectively investigated the characteristics and outcome of shoulder PJI after primary arthroplasty from 1998 to 2010 in a single centre. METHODS: Periprosthetic joint infection was defined as periprosthetic purulence, presence of sinus tract or microbial growth. A Kaplan-Meier survival method was used to estimate relapse-free survival of prosthesis. RESULTS: From 1,571 primary shoulder prostheses, we evaluated 16 patients with a PJI at different stages, i.e, early (n = 4), delayed (n = 6) and late (n = 6) infections. The median patient age was 67 (range 53-86) years, and 69 % were females. The most commonly isolated microorganism was Propionibacterium acnes in 38 % of patients (monobacterial in four and polymicrobial in two patients). In 14 of the 16 patients, surgical interventions consisting of debridement and implant retention (6 patients), exchange (7) and explantation (1) were performed. Four patients had a relapse of infection with P. acnes (n = 3) or Bacteroides fragilis (n = 1). The relapse-free survival of the prosthesis was 75 % (95 % confidence interval 46-90 %) after 1 and 2 years, 100 % in six patients following the treatment algorithm for hip and knee PJI and 60 % in 10 patients not followed up. All but one of the relapses were previously treated without exchange of the prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: As recommended for hip and knee PJI, we suggest treating shoulder PJI with a low-grade infection by microorganisms such as P. acnes with an exchange of the prosthesis. Cohort studies are needed to verify our results.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of a novel series of 17-azapentacyclo [6.6.5.0(2.7).0(9.14).0(15,19)]nonadeca-2,4,6,9,11,13-hexaen-16,18-dione derivatives.
AB  - In the search for novel antimicrobial agents, a series of new derivatives - N-substituted imides were prepared. All of the compounds were characterized by 'H NMR and ESI MS spectra. These derivatives were tested for antimicrobial activity. Microorganisms used in this study included aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and obligatory anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Propionibacterium acnes. Moreover, Candida albicans yeast was used. For representatives of all species the MICs of the investigated compounds were determined. Most of investigated derivatives had no antimicrobial activity (MIC > 512 mg/L) except the derivative 22 which showed slight activity against Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of metapex (calcium hydroxide with iodoform formulation) at different concentrations against selected microorganisms--an in vitro study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess, in vitro, the effectiveness of several concentrations of Metapex (0.22 gm/ml, 0.022 gm/ml, 0.0022 gm/ml) in the elimination of selected microorganisms. Different concentrations of Metapex were prepared by dissolving it in ethanol (99.9%) Pre-sterilized Whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar Petri plates. Plates were incubated aerobically for Enterococcus faecalis (E. Faecalis) and Candida albicans (C. albicans), anaerobically for Bacteroid fragilis (B. fragilis) and Propionibacterium acne respectivally. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. There was significant reduction in the size of zone of inhibition against P. acne, as the concentration of metapex decreases. At lower concentrations of metapex there was no zone of inhibition observed against E. Faecalis, C. Albicans and B. Fragilis. The result of this study suggested that Metapex is a potent antimicrobial agent at higher concentration.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria as a cause of mycotic aneurysm of the aorta: microbiology and  antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - This review summarizes the microbiology, and antimicrobial management of mycotic  aneurysm of the aorta (MAA) due to anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon but important cause of MAA. Most cases of anaerobic MAA are caused anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (mostly B. fragilis group), Clostridium spp. (mostly Clostridium septicum, and Propionobacterium spp. (mostly P. acnes). Clostridial infection is frequently associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic malignancy. A review of all the reported cases is presented. Treatment of MAA involving anaerobic bacteria includes the use of antimicrobial effective against these organisms.
TI  - Oropharyngeal flora changes after tonsillectomy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effect of tonsillectomy on oropharyngeal flora in children who underwent tonsillectomy for chronic recurrent tonsillitis. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective study was performed comprising patients with chronic recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy at the Department of Otolaryngology, Cerrahpasa Medical School. Incisional core biopsies of excised tonsils were also performed. Swabs and core biopsy specimens were transferred and maintained in Stuart's medium and sent to the Department of Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology at Cerrahpasa Medical School for microbiologic evaluation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Oropharyngeal swabs and tonsillar core biopsy specimens from 31 patients operated on for recurrent tonsillitis were cultured. Follow-up oropharyngeal swabs were cultured one month after tonsillectomy. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative isolation rate of the potentially pathogenic bacteria. Normal aerobic flora did not change significantly. However, the isolation rate of the Neisseria species dropped (P = 0.097) but did not reach statistical significance. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, one of the major anaerobic bacteria, dropped significantly (P = 0.007). The Propionibacterium acnes isolation rate increased significantly (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Oropharyngeal anaerobic bacterial flora decreases after tonsillectomy in recurrent tonsillitis patients. The isolation rate for bacteria of the normal flora and potentially pathogenic bacteria does not change. Tonsils with recurrent infections may become a nidus for anaerobic bacteria. In patients with chronic recurrent tonsillitis, tonsillectomy may help change anaerobic bacterial oropharyngeal flora to the normal flora found in healthy individuals.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This review summarizes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis (IE) due to anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon but important cause of IE. Most cases are caused by the anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci Propionibacterium acnes, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species. Predisposing factors and signs and symptoms of IE caused by anaerobic bacteria are similar to those seen in IE due to facultative anaerobic bacteria with the following exceptions: there is a lower incidence of pre-existing valvular heart disease, a higher incidence of thromboembolic events and a higher mortality rate with anaerobic IE. The gastrointestinal tract is the most common source for B. fragilis group IE, the head and neck are the most common origin for Fusobacterium and Bacteroides species, and the head and neck or genitourinary tract is the most common source for Peptostreptococcus species. Multiple mycotic aneurysms are a common complication with anaerobic IE. Others include valvular destruction, aortic-ring abscess, aortitis, cardiogenic shock, dysrrhythmias and septic shock. The mortality rate for patients with anaerobic IE ranges from 21 to 43%. Treatment of anaerobic IE includes the use of antimicrobial effective against these organisms. Surgical intervention may be indicated in some patients.
TI  - Microbiology and management of joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: To describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: The predominant anaerobes in arthritis are anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (AGNB) including the Bacteroides fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes. Infection with P. acnes is associated with a prosthetic joint, previous surgery, and trauma. B. fragilis group is associated with distant infection, Clostridium spp. with trauma, and Fusobacterium spp. with oropharyngeal infection. Most cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate, and most cases are secondary to hematogenous spread. The predominant anaerobes in osteomyelitis are Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Clostridium spp. as well as P. acnes. Conditions predisposing to bone infections are vascular disease, bites, contiguous infection, peripheral neuropathy, hematogenous spread, and trauma. Pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. are mostly isolated in skull and bite infections, members of the B. fragilis group in hand and feet infections, and Fusobacterium spp. in skull, bite, and hematogenous long bone infections. Many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of an anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body that is the source of the organisms involved in the osteomyelitis. Treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material, and antibiotic therapy effective against these organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic bacteria can cause septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Correct diagnosis and appropriate therapy are important contributor to successful outcome.
TI  - In vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. METHODS: The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). RESULTS: Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At <or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. Pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in New Zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. This study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in New Zealand. METHODS: Clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. Susceptibility was determined using NCCLS criteria. The change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the MIC. RESULTS: A total of 364 anaerobes were tested. Penicillin had poor activity against Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Eubacterium spp., Clostridium tertium and Veillonella spp. In general, Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides ureolyticus, Propionibacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. Amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with Bacteroides fragilis group and P. anaerobius isolates. Cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-B. fragilis species, Eubacterium spp. and P. anaerobius. Meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of Bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. With the exception of Propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. There has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. CONCLUSIONS: Metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. No clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.
TI  - Commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce Th1, Th2 or Treg differentiation.
AB  - In various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. Dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. The aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the T-lymphocyte response. To assess the T-lymphocyte response, the expression of CD25, CD69, intracellular interferon gamma (cIFN-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cIL-4) was determined. Dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. Monocytes were stimulated with IL-4 and GM-CSF and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. Cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. Lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. Dendritic cells, primed with antigens of Bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation and expression of intercellular IFN-gamma by T lymphocytes compared to negative controls. The dendritic cells primed with antigens of P. acnes had no effect on T-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of T lymphocytes into CD25bright cells (regulatory T cells) with a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. Dendritic cells primed with antigens of S. mitis induced increased expression of cIL-4. We conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from B. fragilis, S. mitis, and P. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce Th1, Th2, and T(reg) differentiation, respectively. This may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.
TI  - Infected neonatal cephalohematomas caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the microbiological and clinical features of six children with infected cephalohematomas (IC) caused by anaerobic bacteria. DESIGN: Presentation of a case series. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from two to four. Two patients had anaerobes only and the other four had mixed flora of strict anaerobes and facultatives. There were 16 bacterial isolates (12 anaerobic, 4 aerobic). The anaerobic isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates), Prevotella spp. (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (2), and Propionibacterium acnes (1). The aerobic isolates were E. coli (2), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and group B streptococci (1). Blood cultures were positive for three patients. The most common predisposing conditions were vacuum extraction and amnionitis (4 instances of each), instrumental delivery (3), electronic fetal monitoring (2), prolonged delivery (1), and premature rupture of membranes (1). All patients underwent drainage, and four also had surgical incision and drainage of the IC. Osteomyelitis developed in one instance and scalp abscess developed in two patients, both of whom had electronic fetal monitoring. All patients eventually recovered from infection after receiving parenteral and subsequent oral antibiotic therapy for a total of 14-38 days. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in IC in newborns.
TI  - [The study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. METHODS: Observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (NT). RESULTS: (1) Model bile were suitable for the growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and Clostridium. Propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of Bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) Only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enTerococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) With pseudomonas aeruginosa or enTerococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.
TI  - Endocarditis due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of endocarditis  due to anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon but important cause of endocarditis. Most cases of anaerobic endocarditis are caused by anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes and Bacteroides fragilis group. Predisposing factors and signs and symptoms of endocarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria are similar to those seen in endocarditis with facultative anaerobic bacteria with the following exceptions: the gastrointestinal tract was the most common source for B. fragilis group endocarditis, the head and neck were the most common origin for Fusobacterium and Bacteroides spp., and the head and neck and genitourinary tract were the most common source for peptostreptococci. Complications with anaerobic endocarditis include valvular destruction, multiple mycotic aneurysms, aortic-ring abscess, aortitis, cardiogenic shock, dysrhythmias and septic shock. The mortality rate for patients with anaerobes endocarditis is 21-43%. Treatment of endocarditis involving anaerobic bacteria includes the use of antibiotic therapy effective against these organisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  - Using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. Gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/mL against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against Gram-positive organisms. All Haemophilus and Moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/mL of gemifloxacin. Thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/mL of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all Prevotella species [all except one strain of P. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/mL] and occasional strains of Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bilophila wadsworthia, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Propionibacterium acnes, and Veillonella species. All fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/mL of gemifloxacin. Based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.
TI  - Microbiology of infected pustular psoriasis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (PP). The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected PP. METHODS: A retrospective 10-year review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected PP lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). Thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Group D Enterococcus (two isolates), and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented Prevotella spp. in two each. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. S. aureus was isolated from all body sites. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected PP lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.
TI  - Activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against anaerobic bacteria compared to those of eight other agents by time-kill methodology.
AB  - Time-kill studies examined the activities of telithromycin (HMR 3647), erythromycin A, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, pristinamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and metronidazole against 11 gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Time-kill studies were carried out with the addition of Oxyrase in order to prevent the introduction of CO(2). Macrolide-azalide-ketolide MICs were 0.004 to 32.0 microg/ml. Of the latter group, telithromycin had the lowest MICs, especially against non-Bacteroides fragilis group strains, followed by azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin A, and roxithromycin. Clindamycin was active (MIC </= 2.0 microg/ml) against all anaerobes except Peptostreptococcus magnus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, while pristinamycin MICs were 0.06 to 4.0 microg/ml. Amoxicillin-clavulanate had MICs of </=1.0 microg/ml, while metronidazole was active (MICs, 0.03 to 2.0 microg/ml) against all except Propionibacterium acnes. After 48 h at twice the MIC, telithromycin was bactericidal (>/=99.9% killing) against 6 strains, with 99% killing of 9 strains and 90% killing of 10 strains. After 24 h at twice the MIC, 90, 99, and 99.9% killing of nine, six, and three strains, respectively, occurred. Lower rates of killing were seen at earlier times. Similar kill kinetics relative to the MIC were seen with other macrolides. After 48 h at the MIC, clindamycin was bactericidal against 8 strains, with 99 and 90% killing of 9 and 10 strains, respectively. After 24 h, 90% killing of 10 strains occurred at the MIC. The kinetics of clindamycin were similar to those of pristinamycin. After 48 h at the MIC, amoxicillin-clavulanate showed 99.9% killing of seven strains, with 99% killing of eight strains and 90% killing of nine strains. At four times the MIC, metronidazole was bactericidal against 8 of 10 strains tested after 48 h and against all 10 strains after 24 h; after 12 h, 99% killing of all 10 strains occurred.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - In vitro activity of HMR 3647 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to determine the in vitro activity of HMR 3647 compared with other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. The activity of HMR 3647 was determined against 342 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by the agar dilution method and was compared with azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. Among the macrolides HMR 3647 and among the beta-lactams imipenem were the most active agents tested. Anaerobic cocci (50 strains) had the following minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs): HMR 3647, range 0.016-0.125 mg/l; imipenem, range 0.016-0.064 mg/l. Propionibacterium acnes (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-1.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.032-0.064 mg/l. Clostridium perfringens (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.5 mg/l. Clostridium difficile (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125-256 mg/l; imipenem, 4.0-8.0 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis (102 strains): HMR 3647, 0.032-16 mg/l; imipenem, 0.064-0.25 mg/l. Bacteroides and Prevotella species (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-4.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.25 mg/l. Fusobacterium nucleatum (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-8.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.008-0.064 mg/l. HMR 3647 may be useful as treatment and prophylaxis for infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Pancreatic fluid collections: diagnostic and therapeutic implications of percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. METHODOLOGY: The study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged 21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. In all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. Microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. Duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12) and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). RESULTS: Complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40 (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. Mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. A variety of organisms were cultured from pancreatic fluid, E. coli being the most prevalent. Enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. Cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. The level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 and five other antimicrobial agents  against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 against 360 anaerobic clinical isolates was  determined by the agar dilution method and compared to that of five other antimicrobial agents. BAY 12-8039 and imipenem were the most active agents tested. The following MIC90 values were determined for BAY 12-8039: Peptostreptococcus spp. (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; Propionibacterium acnes (30 isolates). 0.25 mg/l; Clostridium perfringens (30 isolates), 0.5 mg/l; Clostridium difficile (50 isolates), 2 mg/l; Bacteroides fragilis (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; non-fragilis Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella spp. (100 isolates), 2 mg/l; and Fusobacterium spp. (50 isolates), 0.25 mg/l. The results of the present study show that BAY 12-8039 may be useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of chronic venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU) is unclear. The objective of the study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of CVLU. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the clinical and microbiological laboratory records obtained from patients with CVLU. Microorganisms were grown from 43 specimens obtained from 41 patients. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 18 (42%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in three (7%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 22 (51%). In total, there were 97 isolates, 64 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 0.8 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (26 isolates), group D streptococci (5), and Escherichia coli(5). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (15), Bacteroides fragilis group (6), Propionibacterium acnes (4), and Prevotella spp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: CVLU have a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of ampicillin, cefoperazone and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that of other antibiotics against anaerobic organisms].
AB  - Susceptibility of 180 strains of anaerobic organisms to ampicillin, cefoperazone  and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole was studied with the method of serial microdilutions. 100 per cent of the strains was susceptible to the ampicillin + cefoperazone combination. Only 1 strain of Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to imipenem. 73.4 and 57.8 per cent of the B. fragilis strains were susceptible to cefoxitin and cefoperazone respectively. No resistance to metronidazole was detected. 100 per cent of the strains belonging to Bacteroides spp. fragilis (gr.) and Prevotella spp. was resistant to all the antibiotics except ampicillin. Gram-positive anaerobic cocci were susceptible to all the antibiotics. The strains of Actinomyces spp. and Propionibacterium acnes were resistant to metronidazole. Only 48.7 per cent the Actinomyces strains was susceptible to cefoxitin.
TI  - In vitro activity of DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot, two new glycylcyclines, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot against 350 anaerobic bacterial  strains including anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. Their activity was compared with that of minocycline, doxycycline, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot and imipenem were the most active agents tested. DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot had in vitro activity superior to that of minocycline and doxycycline.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new quinolone BAY y 3118 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by an agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. BAY y 3118, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole were the most active agents tested. The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic bacteria was superior to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
TI  - Susceptibilities of 428 gram-positive and -negative anaerobic bacteria to Bay y3118 compared with their susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 428 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes (including  selected cefoxitin-resistant strains) to Bay y3118 (a new fluoroquinolone), ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and piperacillin-tazobactam were tested. Organisms comprised 115 Bacteroides fragilis group, 116 non-B. fragilis Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 40 fusobacteria, 58 peptostreptococci, 48 gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 51 clostridia. beta-Lactamase production was demonstrated in 87% of the gram-negative rods but in none of the gram-positive organisms. Overall, Bay y3118 was the most active agent, with all organisms inhibited at an MIC of < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml (MICs for 50% [MIC50] and 90% [MIC90] of strains tested, 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively). By contrast, ciprofloxacin was much less active, with only 42% of strains susceptible at a breakpoint of 2.0 micrograms/ml (MIC50, 4.0 micrograms/ml; MIC90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). Metronidazole was active against all gram-negative rods, but 7% of peptostreptococci, 83% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 4% of non-Clostridium perfringens, non-Clostridium difficile clostridia were resistant to this agent (MICs, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). Clindamycin was active against 94% of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 91% of peptostreptococci, and 100% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, but was active against only 70% of fusobacteria and 53% of clostridia. Cefoxitin was active against > or = 90% of all groups except the B. fragilis group and non-Propionibacterium acnes gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (both 85%) and C. difficile (20%). Significant enhancement of piperacillin by tazobactam was seen in all beta-lactamase-positive strains (99% susceptible; MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml), and all beta-lactamase-negative strains were susceptible to piperacillin (MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml). Clinical studies are required to delineate the role of Bay y3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Anaerobic osteomyelitis and arthritis in a military hospital: a 10-year experience.
AB  - PURPOSE: The methods of collecting, transporting, cultivating, and identifying aerobic bacteria in bone and joint infections have improved markedly since the early 1980s. In addition, many of the anaerobes have been reclassified and renamed. The purpose of this study was to provide more current information regarding the incidence of recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens of infected bone and joint. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens from 73 infected bone specimens and 65 infected joints inoculated on media supportive for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria showed bacterial growth. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven organisms (2.2 isolates/specimen), consisting of 122 anaerobic bacteria (1.7 isolates/specimen) and 35 facultative or aerobic bacteria (0.5 isolate/specimen), were recovered from the 73 bone specimens. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered with aerobe or facultative bacteria in 24 (33%) instances. The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides species (49 isolates), anaerobic cocci (45), Fusobacterium species (11), Propionibacterium acnes (7), and Clostridium species (6). Conditions predisposing to bone infections were vascular disease, bites, contiguous infection, peripheral neuropathy, hematogenous spread, and trauma. Pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were mostly isolated in skull and bite infections (7 of 19), members of the Bacteroides fragilis group in hand and feet infection (12 of 16), and Fusobacterium species in skull, bite, and hematogenous long bone infections. Seventy-four organisms (1.1 isolates/specimen), consisting of 67 anaerobic bacteria (1.0 isolate/specimen) and 7 facultative or aerobic bacteria (0.1 isolate/specimen), were isolated from 65 joint specimens. The predominant anaerobes were P. acnes (24 isolates), anaerobic cocci (17), Bacteroides species (10), and Clostridium species (5). Predisposing conditions to joint infection were trauma, prior surgery, presence of a prosthetic joint, and contiguous infection. P. acnes isolates were associated with prosthetic joints, members of the B. fragilis group with hematogenous spread, and Clostridium species with trauma. The clinical presentation of these cases is discussed. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in bone and joint infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of L-627 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of L-627 against 370 anaerobic bacterial strains including  anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. L-627, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested. L-627 had in vitro activity similar to that of the other carbapenems tested.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to tosufloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tosufloxacin against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium  acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. Tosufloxacin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested. Tosufloxacin has an antibacterial activity that warrants investigation in clinical trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Auckland 1987-90.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 292 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by a standard agar dilution method. Metronidazole was the most active agent with only one Bacteroides fragilis, two anaerobic cocci, and Propionibacterium acnes being resistant. For B fragilis itself and other members of the B fragilis group: 35/35 (100%) and 43/44 (98%) respectively, were susceptible to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid; 47/47 (100%) and 55/56 (98%) respectively, were susceptible to cefoxitin; and 20/28 (71%) and 7/25 (28%) respectively, were susceptible to ceftriaxone. All four agents and penicillin were almost always active against anaerobic cocci and Fusobacterium species. All agents were active against clostridium isolates except for cefoxitin where only 47/57 (82%) were susceptible. These results allow comparison with isolates from other locations and may be considered when choosing an antimicrobial agent for prophylaxis or therapy of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to PD 131628.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 131628 against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. PD 131628, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Antibiotic GE2270 a: a novel inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. I. Isolation and characterization.
AB  - A novel antibiotic, GE2270 A, was isolated from the fermentation broth of a strain of Planobispora rosea. The product was found to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Structural characteristics showed similarities between GE2270 A and thiazolyl peptides such as micrococcin which is known to inhibit protein synthesis by acting directly on the ribosome. Despite this similarity GE2270 A showed functional analogy to kirromycin-like antibiotics and pulvomycin, as its molecular target was found to be elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). GE2270 A is active against Gram-positive microorganism and anaerobes and differs from the other EF-Tu inhibitors in its spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in irreversible hydrocolloid impression material and gingival retraction cord.
AB  - This study tested two dental materials in factory-sealed containers for the presence of bacteria that may be a source of infection. Twenty samples of two dental materials found to have contamination in a pilot study were taken from unopened containers using a sterile technique. The samples were inoculated onto chocolate agar plates and into thioglycolate broths with appropriate controls. Plates were examined, colonies were enumerated, Gram stained, and identified. The resulting contamination frequencies were compared for statistical significance using Fisher's exact test. Organisms were isolated from 10% of the negative inoculation control agar plates, while none of the control broths showed contamination. The alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) showed contamination in 50% of the plates and in 65% of the broths (p less than 0.05). The retraction cord had a small sample size and yielded organisms on 5% of the sample plates and in 20% of the thioglycolate broths (p greater than 0.05).
TI  - Bacteremia due to anaerobic bacteria in newborns.
AB  - Awareness of the role of anaerobic bacteria in neonatal bacteremia has increased  in recent years. The incidence of recovery of anaerobes in neonatal bacteremia varies, according to different studies, between 1.8% and 12.5%. Of the 178 cases reported in the literature, 73 were due to Bacteroides species (69 were the Bacteroides fragilis group), 57 Clostridium species (mostly Clostridium perfringens), 35 Peptostreptococci, 5 Propionibacterium acnes, 3 Veillonella species, 3 Fusobacterium species, and 2 Eubacterium species. Predisposing factors were perinatal maternal complications (especially premature rupture of membranes and chorioamnionitis), prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Organisms similar to those recovered in blood were concomitantly isolated in lung aspirates and cerebrospinal and peritoneal fluids. The overall mortality noted is 26% and is highest with B fragilis group (34%). Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy was often a contributory factor for such mortality. Correction of underlying pathology, surgical drainage, and the use of proper antimicrobials are critical to successful resolution of the infection. Penicillin G is the drug of choice for anaerobic infection other than beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides. Antimicrobials useful for therapy of beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides include clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, imipenem-cilastatin, and the combination of a penicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor.
TI  - In vitro activity of teicoplanin, vancomycin, A16686, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of teicoplanin and A16686, two new glycopeptide antibiotics was determined against 196 isolates of anaerobic bacteria. The activity of teicoplanin and A16686, in comparison with that of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid was 2 to 16 times higher against the gram positive anaerobes, namely, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species and Peptostreptococcus species. However, Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to teicoplanin and A16686 while Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides bivius were found to be sensitive.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Anaerobic bacterial bacteremia: 12-year experience in two military hospitals.
AB  - Clinical and microbiologic data of 296 patients with anaerobic bacteremia were reviewed. Anaerobes were isolated with aerobic or facultative bacteremia in 23 instances. The Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 148 (70%) of 212 isolates of Bacteroides species. B. fragilis accounted for 78% and B. thetaiotaomicron for 14%. Among other species, there were 20 (6%) Fusobacterium organisms, 63 (18%) Clostridium isolates, and 53 (15%) anaerobic cocci. Seventy-five patients died: 40 had B. fragilis group isolates - B. fragilis, 28, and B. thetaiotaomicron, 8 - and 21 had Clostridium organisms isolated. The primary portals of entry were the gastrointestinal tract (42%), decubiti and gangrene (10%), the female genital tract (8%), and the oropharynx (7%). The gastrointestinal tract, decubiti, and gangrene were the predominant sources for B. fragilis and Clostridium organisms, the female genital tract and oropharynx for anaerobic cocci and Fusobacterium species, and the oropharynx for pigmented Bacteroides. Foreign body was associated with Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium species. Factors predisposing to bacteremia were abscesses, 53; malignancy, 51; surgery, 30; and intestinal obstruction or perforation, 27.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to meropenem.
AB  - The activity of meropenem was determined against 350 strains of anaerobic bacteria by an agar dilution method. It was compared with those of piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active agents tested. On the basis of these results, meropenem appears to be a promising antimicrobial agent for anaerobic infections and warrants further clinical investigation.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef compared to moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and  clindamycin against anaerobes.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of flomoxef (6315-S), moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against anaerobes 197 clinical isolates (27 Bacteroides fragilis, 42 B. thetaiotaomicron, 10 B. vulgatus, 7 B. ovatus, 6 B. uniformis, 6 B. distasonis, 7 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, 11 Bacteroides oralis group, 21 Clostridium difficile, 7 C. perfringens, 3 C. sporogenes, 3 Clostridium spp., 33 Propionibacterium acnes, 14 Peptococcaceae) were studied by means of agar dilution tests. The MIC90 of B. fragilis was less than 2 micrograms/ml for flomoxef, less than 4 micrograms/ml for moxalactam, less than 16 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin, less than 128 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime and less than 2 micrograms/ml for clindamycin. The respective MIC90's of B. thetaiotaomicron were less than 64, less than 128, less than 32, less than 256 and 8 micrograms/ml. Strains of the other Bacteroides species and groups were more susceptible to flomoxef and the other antibiotics than B. thetaiotaomicron. Against Clostridium difficile flomoxef (MIC90 less than 4 micrograms/ml) proved to be superior to the other agents tested. Most of the Clostridium strains other than C. difficile were also susceptible to flomoxef; anaerobic grampositive cocci and Propionibacterium acnes were very sensitive (MIC90's less than 1 and less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml, respectively). Its anti-anaerobic activity, together with its efficacy against aerobes, should make flomoxef a useful adjunct to the arsenal of modern antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in aortofemoral graft infection.
AB  - A 10-year review of specimens of aortofemoral graft infection sent to the microbiology laboratory for cultures of anaerobic bacteria revealed the presence of these organisms in 13 of 16 specimens. Nineteen organisms (1.5 per patient) were isolated: 16 anaerobes and 3 aerobes. The predominant bacteria were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (six isolates), Propionibacterium acnes (five), and Bacteroides fragilis group (four). Polymicrobial infection was present in three patients, all with decubitus ulcers. Conditions predisposing to the infections were present in nine patients and included the presence of preoperative infections in the form of ulcer or toe gangrene in four, decubitus ulcer in three, reoperation in two, and diabetes mellitus in one. These data illustrate the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in aortofemoral graft infection.
TI  - [In vitro activity of an ofloxacin-metronidazole combination against anaerobic bacteria. Kinetics of the action of metronidazole against Bacteroides fragilis].
AB  - The activity of metronidazole combined with ofloxacin was investigated by the checkerboard method in liquid medium against 60 obligate anaerobes. The bacteriostatic effect of the combination was assessed by calculating the FIC index. Two metronidazole resistant strains of Propionibacterium acnes (MIC greater than 32 mg/l) were inhibited by 0.125 mg/l of this former antibiotic in presence of an ofloxacin concentration equal to half the value of the MIC. On the 58 other anaerobic strains, the combination of metronidazole plus ofloxacin had an additive bacteriostatic effect (30 strains) or a synergistic effect (26 strains). No antagonism was noted with any strain. For selected anaerobic or mixed infections the combination of metronidazole and ofloxacin may be useful. Killing curves demonstrated that, under good anaerobic conditions, metronidazole acted rapidly against Bacteroides fragilis. At a concentration of 8 mg/l, a decrease of log10 of the population was observed after 2 hours. After a contact ranging from 1 to 8 hours, depending of the investigated strains, a bactericidal effect was observed with metronidazole.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. Metronidazole was the most active agent; only Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant. Clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. Beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the Bacteroides fragilis group. At a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of Fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. The highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the B. fragilis group. Within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. We conclude that metronidazole has the most predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.
TI  - Contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  - Protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. Comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. Thimerosal, iodoacetate, EDTA and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by bacteria in the large gut. These results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. Studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of Bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. Extracellular proteases were formed by Streptococcus faecalis ST6, Propionibacterium acnes P6, Clostridium perfringens C16, Cl. bifermentans C21 and Cl. sporogenes C25. Inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.
TI  - Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  - Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.
TI  - In vitro activity of ampicillin plus sulbactam against anaerobes compared to ampicillin and cefoxitin.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 195 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was studied to ampicillin alone, ampicillin + 1 mg/l sulbactam, ampicillin + 5 mg/l sulbactam, and cefoxitin by means of agar dilution tests. The ampicillin-sulbactam combinations were the most effective drugs against species of the Bacteroides fragilis group, the MIC90 of ampicillin + 5 mg/l sulbactam for B. fragilis being less than 1 mg/l, compared to 256 mg/l of ampicillin, 4 mg/l of ampicillin + 1 mg/l sulbactam, and 8 mg/l of cefoxitin. No significant difference between ampicillin alone and in combination with sulbactam was observed against gram-positive anaerobic rods, Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. with MIC's less than 2 mg/l.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - The effect of carbon dioxide on the in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 (a novel macrolide antimicrobial with improved pharmacokinetics) was determined against a variety of anaerobic bacteria in anaerobic atmospheres with and without added carbon dioxide. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar (Oxoid, UK) containing saponinlysed horse blood to a final concentration of 10%. The inoculum used was approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide or in hydrogen alone. The MIC of each antimicrobial for each organism examined was determined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial which completely inhibited growth of the inoculum. The minimum concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of the bacteria examined were also determined. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, B. bivius and Fusobacterium spp. were generally 10-100 times greater when determined in the presence of carbon dioxide than when determined in hydrogen alone. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for B. melaninogenicus, Peptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile and Propionibacterium acnes were less affected by the presence of carbon dioxide.
TI  - In vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antimicrobial, was determined against a total of 286 anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides fragilis group (100), B. melaninogenicus (21), B. bivius (16), Fusobacterium spp. (15), Peptococcus spp. (20), Peptostreptococcus spp. (21), Clostridium perfringens (23), C. difficile (41) and Propionibacterium acnes (29). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere. Both vancomycin and teicoplanin were highly active against all the Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria examined, 90% of all isolates being inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml of either antimicrobial. Isolates of B. fragilis group and Fusobacterium spp. were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 micrograms/ml) and teicoplanin (MIC90 128 micrograms/ml). Unexpectedly, isolates of B. melaninogenicus and B. bivius which were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 and 128 micrograms/ml respectively) were sensitive to teicoplanin (MIC90 2 and 2 micrograms/ml respectively).
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - Protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  - Factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. Protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. Host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. Microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. Nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. Microorganisms including Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. Protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 and other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of Sch 34343 was determined against 575 strains of anaerobic bacteria by an agar-dilution method. Its activity was compared with that of benzylpenicillin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, fusidic acid and bacitracin. Sch 34343 and imipenem were the most active agents tested. Based on these results, Sch 34343 appears to be a promising antimicrobial agent for anaerobic infections and warrants further clinical investigations.
TI  - Experimental otitis media in guinea pigs. Serum antibody response to Bacteroides  fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius upon challenge.
AB  - The production of antibodies in serum was studied after inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius into the middle ear of guinea pigs. Inoculation of B. fragilis resulted in IgG and IgM serum antibodies at an early stage of the infection, while IgA antibodies were seldom detected and at a later stage. In contrast, inoculation of P. acnes or P. anaerobius induced no serum antibody response. Of these three species B. fragilis induced the most intense otitis, whereas P. anaerobius failed to induce otitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Sweden in 1983.
AB  - This review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility. Data on the susceptibility to different antimicrobials of anaerobic isolates in Sweden during 1983 is presented. Among the different bacterial groups, Clostridium perfringens, propionibacteria, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. C. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin and imipenem, but resistant to cefoxitin. Most C. difficile strains were also susceptible to clindamycin and fusidic acid, while all strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. The majority of the fusobacteria were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. However, some strains were found to be resistant to penicillins. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole and imipenem had the best activity, whereas piperacillin and cefoxitin showed good activities. Most Bacteroides non-fragilis strains were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. However, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant especially to penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years.
TI  - [Anaerobic sepsis].
AB  
TI  - New antibiotic, isohematinic acid. II. Physico-chemical properties, structural elucidation and biological activities.
AB  - Physico-chemical characterization of isohematinic acid revealed that this antibiotic has a succinimide nucleus. From elemental analysis, the molecular formula of isohematinic acid was determined to be C8H9NO4. Isohematinic acid showed weak antimicrobial activities against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Propionibacterium acnes.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of niridazole. II. Effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. First, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole is completely ineffective. There exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. The in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. Second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. Extremely low MIC values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. Propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are also relatively resistant to niridazole.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Anaerobic septicaemia is often a complication of preexisting anaerobic sepsis which is commonly a complication of surgical interference. The predominant anaerobic bacterial isolate in septicaemia if Bacteroides fragilis. Anaerobic cocci and clostridia are not infrequently found as causes of septicaemia. The incidence of polymicrobial septicaemia varies in the different reports. The clinical features of septicaemia due to anaerobic Gram-negative rods vary little from those due to facultative anaerobic Gram-negative rods. The entry portal of bacteroides and clostridia is the gastrointestinal tract and the female genital tract. The portal of entry of anaerobic cocci is the respiratory tract. Anaerobic septicaemia include a high incidence of jaundice, septic thrombophlebitis and metastatic abscess formation. When appropriate antibacterial agents are used for the treatment of anaerobic septicaemia, a mortality rate of 10% is seen while in the absence of treatment the mortality is high, 60-80%. Anaerobic bacteria is an uncommon but important cause of endocarditis. Most cases of anaerobic endocarditis are caused by anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes and B. fragilis. Predisposing factors and signs and symptoms of endocarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria are similar to those seen in endocarditis with facultative anaerobic bacteria with the following exceptions. There is a lower incidence of preexisting valvular heart disease, a higher incidence of thromboemboli events and a higher mortality rate with anaerobic endocarditis. The article is a review of our present knowledge of the normal anaerobic human microflora in relation to development of septicaemia and endocarditis, virulence factors in anaerobic bacteria, antibiotic susceptibility patterns of anaerobic bacteria and clinical findings in patients with anaerobic septicaemia respectively endocarditis.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria in clinical specimens of a hospital laboratory (author's transl)].
AB  - Over a 14-month period 261 clinical specimens were cultured anaerobically, this figure representing about 3% of the total specimens submitted to the microbiological laboratory. Not accepted for anaerobic culture were stools, sputa, urines, vaginal and urethral swabs and swabs from superficial skin lesions. All materials were sent to the laboratory in an anaerobic transport medium and processed according to the recommendations of the American Society for Microbiology and the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia. Not included in this figure are blood cultures and cultures from removed venous catheters. 35% of the specimens contained anaerobes. 169 anaerobic strains were isolated. 78 of them belonged to the Bacteroides fragilis group. Clostridium perfringens was found in only 7 cases. 14% of the strains were B. melaninogenicus, 7% other gram-negative non-sporeforming rods. In most of the cases a mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora was found. More than 75% of specimens obtained from infections originating from the lower intestinal tract yielded growth of anaerobes. In infections of the bile duct anaerobes were found in 25% of the cases. In infections of the upper urinary tract anaerobes played no major role. 35% of the isolates of the B. fragilis group were resistant to tetracycline, 17% to cefoxitin and 9% to clindamycin.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 Bacteroides sp (11 in the B fragilis group); four anaerobic Gram-positive cocci; four Clostridium sp; four Propionibacterium acnes; and three Fusobacterium sp. No aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. The gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to Bacteroides organisms, four to Clostridium sp, and one to F nucleatum. The ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to Peptococcus sp and two to Fusobacterium sp. Five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by B fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by P acnes. The average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). The early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.
TI  - Modulation of the rats' immune status by monoassociation with anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The capacity of a pure culture of anaerobic intestinal bacteria to influence the  host's cellular and humoral immune systems was investigated with germfree, monoassociated, and conventionally reared rats. Monoassociation of germfree rats with Bacteroides fragilis stimulated the production of serum gamma globulin, agglutinating antibodies, and an apparent IgG (immunoelectrophoresis) band. A comparison of the in vitro blastogenic potential of lymphocytes (spleen cells and mesenteric lymph node cells) from germfree, monoassociated, and conventionally reared rats indicated the following: (1) the microbial flora had no obvious effect on the capacity of nonstimulated lymphocytes to incorporate [3H]thymidine; (2) spleen cells from conventionally reared rats responded to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or pokeweed mitogen better than splenocytes from germfree rats; (3) colonization of germfree rats with Fusobacterium necrophorum increased the responsiveness of splenocytes to photohemagglutinin and concanavalin A; and (4) monoassociation of germfree rats with B. fragilis, but not with F. necrophorum or propionibacterium acnes, increased splenocyte blastogenesis to homologous (i.e., colonizing) bacterial antigens. This study indicated that some intestinal bacteria can modulate the immune status of the host; the extent and nature of this modulation depended on the particular species of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - [Metronidazole sensitivity of anaerobes. A comparison with other chemotherapeutics (author's transl)].
AB  - In comparative in vitro studies, broad spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins showed a relatively weak action in the range of beta-lactamase-positive bacteroides species (B. fragilis, B. thetaiotamicron) bacteroidaceae activity being otherwise good. Clindamycin was more effective against bacteroides species than against bacteria of the fusobacterium-sphaerophorus group. Metronidazole, however, showed no gap in its efficacy against bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and clostridium spp. with the exception of Propionibacterium acnes. The substance is therefore suitable alone and in combination for the chemotherapy of anaerobic infections.20
TI  - Gastrointestinal ecology and histology of rats monoassociated with anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of anaerobic bacteria colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of germfree rats and induced an increase in the cellularity of intestinal tissue.
TI  - Comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar diffusion tests. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. Saccharolytic Bacteroides strains (39 B. fragilis, 6 B. thetaiotaomicron, 4 B. vulgatus) showed broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and MICs of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees C. With strains of B. oralis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, B. corrodens, Veillonella sp. and Megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution MICs were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Eubacterium sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. had broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas Peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. With the great majority of strains tested, MICs were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. Clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. Several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and MIC. With gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution MIC and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for Peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for P. acnes). When calculating the regression lines for agar dilution MICs and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for Peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for P. acnes). With B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution MICs and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  - Twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. Peptococci (Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus micros, P. anaerobius, P. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. Anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces israelii, and Bacteroides fragilis). Antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. Anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or osteosynthesis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the maternal cervix and newborn gastric  fluid and conjunctiva: a prospective study.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on cervical swabs from 35 mothers and their newborn infants' gastric aspirates and conjunctival sacs. Four hundred seventy-nine isolates were obtained; 287 were aerobes and 192 were anaerobes. The cervical and gastric cultures overall yielded a similar flora, but this was not always the case when one compared mothers with their own newborn infants. The conjunctival cultures yielded about half of the number of bacteria per specimen that the gastric contents yielded, and a repeat conjunctival culture done 48 hours later showed a marked reduction in the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated. The predominant aerobes isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, viridans streptococci and Haemophilus vaginalis. The predominant anaerobes were the Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, Peptococcus, other Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus organisms. Statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the isolation of certain groups of organisms and increased duration of pregnancy, increased baby's weight, and prolonged duration of labor.
TI  - Low trimethoprim susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria due to insensitive dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  - All the 28 Bacteroides fragilis strains investigated were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 16 mug/ml) and resistant to trimethoprim (TMP; minimal inhibitory concentration > 4 mug/ml). Synergism between sulfamethoxazole and TMP was present in all strains at a ratio of 1:1. The few clostridia investigated proved more resistant to both compounds. Dihydrofolate reductases from B. fragilis, C. perfringens, and some other anaerobic species were isolated. Inhibition profiles with six structurally different inhibitors revealed major differences in all enzymes. For 50% inhibition, the enzyme from B. fragilis and all clostridia required concentrations of TMP which were between several hundredfold and 1,000-fold higher than those required for the enzyme of Escherichia coli, whereas the enzyme from Propionibacterium acnes only needed a threefold higher concentration. In vitro activities of TMP were seen to correspond to the activity at the enzymatic level in B. fragilis and P. acnes, but correspond to a much lesser extent to the activity at the enzymatic level in clostridia, where a poor penetration is assumed to be involved. Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors other than TMP were found to be as active as TMP both at the enzyme and in vitro. In B. fragilis, higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine were required for increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of TMP than in E. coli and probably also in C. perfringens.
TI  - In vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 HFU), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  - The susceptibility of more than 40 strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (Sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. The influences of density of the inoculum upon MICs was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. Bacteroides fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. splanchnicus, B. oralis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium fusiforme (F. nucleatum), Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Clostridium perfringens, C. fallax, Propionibacterium acnes and several species of Peptococcaceae showed broth dilution MICs of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. Members of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of S. varius had a broth dilution MIC of 256 microgram/ml. With most strains, the agar dilution MICs were 2 similar to 4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution MICs. In pour plate-tests, the MICs were not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. With most anaerobes, the MBCs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the MICs. The results obtained indicated that, apart from S. varius, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis and S. freundii (F. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including B. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.
TI  - Detection of alcohols and volatile fatty acids by head-space gas chromatography in identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A head-space gas chromatographic technique for the analysis of volatile bacterial metabolites is described. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Propionibacterium acnes, cultured in a glucose-containing peptone yeast extract medium, were studied. The head-space technique was compared with the injection of the complete liquid culture medium, and solvent extracts thereof, into the gas chromatograph. Volatile fatty acids could be detected by all three methods, whereas alcohols produced by C. perfringens and P. acnes were detectable only in the head-space chromatograms. Both FFAP and Porapak Q were used as gas chromatography stationary phase. Porapak Q was found more suitable than FFAP for the separation of alcohols. The head-space technique requires a minimum of preparation before the analysis and is well suited to automation.
TI  - Bacteriology of cholesteatoma: clinical significance.

TI  - Superoxide dismutase in anaerobic bacteria of clinical significance.
AB  - Twenty-two anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected sites and normal fecal flora were assayed for superoxide dismutase (SOD). The organisms were also classified according to their oxygen tolerance into aerotolerant, intermediate, and extremely oxygen-sensitive groups. There was a correlation between the enzyme level and the oxygen tolerance, in that the aerotolerant and intermediate organisms had SOD, whereas the extremely oxygen-sensitive isolates had low or undetectable enzyme. Among the oxygen-tolerant organisms, gram-negative bacteria had higher levels of SOD than gram-positive organisms. Oxygen was shown to induce SOD production in a strain of Bacteriodes fragilis grown in minimal medium under continuous-culture conditions. Enzyme levels in this isolate grown under static conditions were lower in minimal medium than in complex medium, indicating that other components in the complex medium were stimulating the production of SOD. Our data suggest that the variation in oxygen tolerance of anaerobes is usually related to their level of SOD. It is postulated that SOD may be a virulence factor that allows pathogenic anaerobes to survive in oxygenated tissues until the proper reduced conditions are established for their growth.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - [Susceptibility to Thiamphenicol and Chloramphenicol of Anaerobic Bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, With chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 Bacteroides fragilis, 13 B. thetaiotaomicron, 14 B. oralis, 16 Sphaerophorus varius etc.) had MIC values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. Very similar results (MIC, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. In concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. Strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (MIC, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to B. fragilis or other Bacteroides species. Members of the Fusobacterium and Sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. With both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (P. acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. Of 37 Clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Only one strain each of C. perfringens and Clostridium sp. had an MIC of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. Accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. A standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 Bacteroidaceae, 18 Peptococcaceae and 20 C, (P.) acnes strains. Only a poor correlation was observed between MIC and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. Therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. Thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.
