TI  == fate and efficacy of lacticin 3147-producing lactococcus lactis in the mammalian  gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == gastrointestinal survival of the bacteriocin-producing strain, lactococcus lactis dpc6520, was evaluated systematically in vitro and in vivo with a view to using this strain to deliver biologically active lacticin 3147, a broad-spectrum bacteriocin, to the gut. the activity of the lacticin 3147 producer was also evaluated against two clinically relevant pathogens: clostridium difficile and listeria monocytogenes. when suspended in an appropriate matrix, the lactococcal  strain is capable of surviving simulated gastrointestinal juices similar to the porcine probiotic, lactobacillus salivarius dpc6005. upon administration of l. lactis dpc6520 to pigs (n=4), excretion rates of approximately 10(2) -10(5) cfu g(-1) faeces were observed by day 5. although passage through the gastrointestinal tract (git) did not affect lacticin 3147 production by l. lactis dpc6520 isolates, activity was undetectable in faecal samples by an agar well diffusion assay. furthermore, l. lactis dpc6520 had no inhibitory effect on c. difficile or other bacterial populations in a human distal colon model, while lactococcal counts declined 10,000-fold over 24 h. the lacticin 3147 producer failed to prevent l. monocytogenes infection in a mouse model, even though a mean l. lactis dpc6520 count of 4.7 x 10(4) cfu g(-1) faeces was obtained over the 5-day administration period. these data demonstrate that l. lactis dpc6520 is capable of surviving transit through the git, and yet lacks antimicrobial efficacy in the models of infection used.

TI  == modulation of pathogen-induced ccl20 secretion from ht-29 human intestinal epithelial cells by commensal bacteria.
AB  == background: human intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) secrete the chemokine ccl20  in response to infection by various enteropathogenic bacteria or exposure to bacterial flagellin. ccl20 recruits immature dendritic cells and lymphocytes to target sites. here we investigated iec responses to various pathogenic and commensal bacteria as well as the modulatory effects of commensal bacteria on pathogen-induced ccl20 secretion. ht-29 human iecs were incubated with commensal  bacteria (bifidobacterium infantis or lactobacillus salivarius), or with salmonella typhimurium, its flagellin, clostridium difficile, mycobacterium paratuberculosis, or mycobacterium smegmatis for varying times. in some studies,  ht-29 cells were pre-treated with a commensal strain for 2 hr prior to infection  or flagellin stimulation. ccl20 and interleukin (il)-8 secretion and nuclear factor (nf)-kappab activation were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. results: compared to untreated cells, s. typhimurium, c. difficile, m. paratuberculosis, and flagellin activated nf-kappab and stimulated significant secretion of ccl20 and il-8 by ht-29 cells. conversely, b. infantis, l. salivarius or m. smegmatis did not activate nf-kappab or augment ccl20 or il-8 production. treatment with b. infantis, but not l. salivarius, dose-dependently inhibited the baseline secretion of ccl20. in cells pre-treated with b. infantis, c. difficile-, s. typhimurium-, and flagellin-induced ccl20 were significantly attenuated. b. infantis did not limit m. paratuberculosis-induced ccl20 secretion. conclusion: this study is the first to demonstrate that a commensal strain can attenuate ccl20 secretion in ht-29 iecs. collectively, the data indicate that m. paratuberculosis may mediate mucosal damage and that b. infantis can exert immunomodulatory effects on iecs that mediate host responses to flagellin and flagellated enteric pathogens.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

TI  == identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability  to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e.  coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.
