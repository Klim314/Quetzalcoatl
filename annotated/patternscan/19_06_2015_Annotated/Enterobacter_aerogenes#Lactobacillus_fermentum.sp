TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == biogenic silver for disinfection of water contaminated with viruses.
AB  == the presence of enteric viruses in drinking water is a potential health risk. growing interest has arisen in nanometals for water disinfection, in particular the use of silver-based nanotechnology. in this study, lactobacillus fermentum served as a reducing agent and bacterial carrier matrix for zerovalent silver nanoparticles, referred to as biogenic ag(0). the antiviral action of biogenic ag(0) was examined in water spiked with an enterobacter aerogenes-infecting bacteriophage (uz1). addition of 5.4 mg liter(-1) biogenic ag(0) caused a 4.0-log decrease of the phage after 1 h, whereas the use of chemically produced silver nanoparticles (nag(0)) showed no inactivation within the same time frame. a control experiment with 5.4 mg liter(-1) ionic ag+ resulted in a similar inactivation after 5 h only. the antiviral properties of biogenic ag(0) were also demonstrated on the murine norovirus 1 (mnv-1), a model organism for human noroviruses. biogenic ag(0) was applied to an electropositive cartridge filter (nanoceram) to evaluate its capacity for continuous disinfection. addition of 31.25 mg biogenic ag(0) m(-2) on the filter (135 mg biogenic ag(0) kg(-1) filter  medium) caused a 3.8-log decline of the virus. in contrast, only a 1.5-log decrease could be obtained with the original filter. this is the first report to  demonstrate the antiviral efficacy of extracellular biogenic ag(0) and its promising opportunities for continuous water disinfection.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
