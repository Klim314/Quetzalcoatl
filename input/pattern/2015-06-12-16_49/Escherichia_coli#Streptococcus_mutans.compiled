TI  - Bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400, and polyethylene glycol 1000 against selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), and polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG 1000) against selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five vehicles, namely propylene glycol, glycerine, PEG 400, PEG 1000, and combination of propylene glycol with PEG 400, were tested for their bactericidal activity. The minimum bactericidal concentration was noted against four standard strains of organisms, i.e. Streptococcus mutans American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25175, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 12598, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 35550, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, using broth dilution assay. Successful endodontic therapy depends upon thorough disinfection of root canals. In some refractory cases, routine endodontic therapy is not sufficient, so intracanal medicaments are used for proper disinfection of canals. Intracanal medicaments are dispensed with vehicles which aid in increased diffusion through the dentinal tubules and improve their efficacy. Among the various vehicles used, glycerine is easily available, whereas others like propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol have to be procured from appropriate sources. Also, these vehicles, being viscous, aid in sustained release of the medicaments and improve their handling properties. The most commonly used intracanal medicaments like calcium hydroxide are ineffective on many microorganisms, while most of the other medicaments like MTAD (Mixture of Tetracycline, an Acid, and a Detergent) and Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP) consist of antibiotics which can lead to development of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms. Thus, in order to use safer and equally effective intracanal medicaments, newer alternatives like chlorhexidine gluconate, ozonized water, etc., are being explored. Similarly, the five vehicles mentioned above are being tested for their antimicrobial activity in this study. RESULTS: All vehicles exhibited bactericidal activity at 100% concentration. CONCLUSION: Propylene glycol was effective against three organisms namely S. mutans E. faecalis and E. coli and its bactericidal activity was at 50%, 25% and 50% respectively. PEG 1000 was effective against S. mutans and E. coli at 25%. Hence propylene glycol was effective on more number of organisms of which E. faecalis is a known resistant species. PEG 1000 was bactericidal at a lower concentration but was effective on two organisms only.
TI  - The antibacterial effect of four mouthwashes against streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial properties of several mouthwash concentrations on oral Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli. METHODS: The study was conducted at Shiraz Medicine School in 2011. Serial dilutions of Chlorohexidin, Oral B and Persica and Irsha (2,4,8,16,64,128) were prepared in Muller-Hinton media. Minimum inhibitory concentration was visually determined and defined as the lowest concentration of each oral washing which inhibited > 95% growth reduction compared to the growth control well. RESULTS: Chlorhexidine, Oral B and Irsha mouthwash inhibited Streptococcus mutans even with diluted concentrations. Also, Chlorhexidine and Oral B prohibited Escherichia coli with different potencies. But Persica had no antimicrobial activity against either Escherichia coli or Streptococcus mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine, Irsha, and Oral B mouthwashes can be used for antimicrobial effects, especially on Streptococcus mutans. This chemical activity of mouthwashes is an adjuvant for mechanical removing of plaque. However, the antimicrobial effect of Persicaremains controversial.
TI  - Inhibition of Gallic Acid on the Growth and Biofilm Formation of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - New strategies for biofilm inhibition are becoming highly necessary because of the concerns to synthetic additives. As gallic acid (GA) is a hydrolysated natural product of tannin in Chinese gall, this research studied the effects of GA on the growth and biofilm formation of bacteria (Escherichia coli [Gram-negative] and Streptococcus mutans [Gram-positive]) under different conditions, such as nutrient levels, temperatures (25 and 37 degrees C) and incubation times (24 and 48 h). The minimum antimicrobial concentration of GA against the two pathogenic organisms was determined as 8 mg/mL. GA significantly affected the growth curves of both test strains at 25 and 37 degrees C. The nutrient level, temperature, and treatment time influenced the inhibition activity of GA on both growth and biofim formation of tested pathogens. The inhibition effect of GA on biofilm could be due to other factors in addition to the antibacterial effect. Overall, GA was most effective against cultures incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and at 25 degrees C for 48 h in various concentrations of nutrients and in vegetable wash waters, which indicated the potential of GA as emergent sources of biofilm control products.
TI  - Designing dental composites with bioactive and bactericidal properties.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to fabricate and evaluate new antibacterial  and bioactive composites capable of strictly controlling oral bacteria, enhancing apatite layer formation and retaining their mechanical properties. METHODS: A new Ag-doped bioactive glass (Ag-BG) was incorporated into flowable dental composite (COMP) in different concentrations (1, 5, and 15wt.%) in order to fabricate new combined bioactive and antibacterial composite materials (Ag-BGCOMPs). The antibacterial properties, bioactivity, and total bond strength of the Ag-BGCOMPs were evaluated. RESULTS: The bioactivity of the Ag-BG was confirmed after its immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF). The total bond strength between the surrounding tooth tissue and the new composites or the control (dental composite alone) has not shown any statistically significant difference in the performed pilot study. Antibacterial activity was observed against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) for the Ag-BGCOMP 5wt.% and 15wt.% but not for the Ag-BGCOMP 1wt.% or the control. CONCLUSIONS: This work contributes to our long term aim which is the fabrication of dental materials capable of reducing bacteria invasion and enhancing remineralization of the surrounding dental tissues. SIGNIFICANCE: We anticipate that these new composites could ultimately prevent restoration failure by inhibiting the formation of secondary caries and by remineralizing the hard tissues surrounding tooth lesions.
TI  - Small molecule fluoride toxicity agonists.
AB  - Fluoride is a ubiquitous anion that inhibits a wide variety of metabolic processes. Here, we report the identification of a series of compounds that enhance fluoride toxicity in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans. These molecules were isolated by using a high-throughput screen (HTS) for compounds that increase intracellular fluoride levels as determined via a fluoride riboswitch reporter fusion construct. A series of derivatives were synthesized to examine structure-activity relationships, leading to the identification of compounds with improved activity. Thus, we demonstrate that small molecule fluoride toxicity agonists can be identified by HTS from existing chemical libraries by exploiting a natural fluoride riboswitch. In addition, our findings suggest that some molecules might be further optimized to function as binary antibacterial agents when combined with fluoride.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from Artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  - CONTEXT: Preparations from Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from A. heterophyllus heartwoods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered A. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Each of the extracts was screened for their antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). Their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. The extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/mL, respectively. Based on an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. Among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. mutans, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis with MICs of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, and MBCs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 12.9 and 25.8 microM, respectively. Only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an MIC of 286.4 microM.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of extracts and metabolites of Robinia pseudoacacia L. on Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis causing dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases.
AB  - The mouth cavity hosts many types of anaerobic bacteria, including Streptococcus  mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, which cause periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of extracts of Robinia pseudoacacia and its different fractions, as well as some of its natural compounds against oral pathogens and a nonpathogenic reference bacteria, Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of the crude extract and the solvent fractions (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol) of R. pseudoacacia were evaluated against S. mutans, P. gingivalis and E. coli DH5alpha by standard micro-assay procedure using conventional sterile polystyrene microplates. The results showed that the crude extract was more active against P. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) than against S. mutans (73% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/mL. The chloroform and hexane fractions were active against P. gingivalis, with 91 and 97% growth inhibition, respectively, at 0.2 mg/mL. None of seven natural compounds found in R. pseudoacacia exerted an antibacterial effect on P. gingivalis; however, fisetin and myricetin at 8 microg/mL inhibited the growth of S. mutans by 81% and 86%, respectively. The crude extract of R. pseudoacacia possesses bioactive compounds that could completely control the growth of P. gingivalis. The antibiotic activities of the hexane and chloroform fractions suggest that the active compounds are hydrophobic in nature. The results indicate the effectiveness of the plant in clinical applications for the treatment of dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases and its potential use as disinfectant for various surgical and orthodontic appliances.
TI  - Lactoferrin: A Roadmap to the Borderland between Caries and Periodontal Disease.
AB  - Lactoferrin is one of a number of multifunctional proteins that are present in or on all mucosal surfaces throughout the body. Levels of lactoferrin are consistently elevated in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, corneal disease, and periodontitis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lactoferrin have been shown to be present in individuals susceptible to Escherichia coli-induced travelers' diarrhea and in tear fluid derived from virally associated corneal disease. Here, we review data showing a lactoferrin SNP in amino acid position 29 in the antimicrobial region of lactoferrin that acts against caries associated bacteria. This SNP was initially discovered in African American subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) who had proximal bone loss but minimal proximal caries. Results were confirmed in a genetic association study of children from Brazil with this same SNP who showed a reduced level of caries. In vitro data indicate that lactoferrin from whole saliva derived from subjects with this SNP, recombinant human lactoferrin containing this SNP, or an 11-mer peptide designed for this SNP kills mutans streptococci associated with caries by >1 log. In contrast, the SNP has minimal effect on Gram-negative species associated with periodontitis. Moreover, periodontally healthy subjects homozygous for this lysine (K) SNP have lactoferrin in their saliva that kills mutans streptococci and have reduced proximal decay. The review summarizes data supporting the ecologic plaque hypothesis and suggests that a genetic variant in lactoferrin with K in position 29 when found in saliva and crevice fluid can influence community biofilm composition. We propose that, for caries, this SNP is ethnicity independent and protective by directly killing caries-provoking bacteria (reducing proximal decay). However, the clinical effect of this SNP in LAP is ethnicity dependent, destructive (increases LAP incidence), and complex with mechanisms still to be determined.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Anacardium occidentale and Mangifera indica in oral care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral health is an integral and important component of general health. Infectious diseases such as caries, periodontal, and gingivitis indicate the onset of imbalance in homeostasis between oral micro biota and host. The present day medicaments used in oral health care have numerous side effects. The uses of herbal plants as an alternative have gained popularity due to side effects of antibiotics and emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Anacardium occidentale (cashew) and Mangifera indica (mango) have been used as traditional oral health care measures in India since time immemorial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extracts of cashew and mango leaves were obtained by maceration method. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by clear zone produced by these plant extracts against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in agar plate method, determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), and suppression of biofilm. The cytotoxic effects of plants extract was determined by microculture tetrazolium assay on human gingival fibroblast and Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79) cell lines. RESULTS: Cashew and mango leaf extract significantly (P < 0.05) produced larger zone of inhibition against test pathogens when compared to povidone-iodine-based mouth rinses. Although the MIC and MBC/MFC values of mouth rinses were effective in lower concentrations; plant extracts significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed the biofilms of oral pathogens. The leaf extracts were less cytotoxic (P < 0.001) compared to mouth rinses. CONCLUSIONS: Plant extracts are superior to the mouth rinses and have a promising role in future oral health care.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity and Mechanism of Photoirradiated Polyphenols against Gram-Positive and -Negative Bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/mL polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to LED light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mW/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial DNA, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. The present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial and antifungal activity of new calcium-based cement (Biodentine) compared to MTA and glass ionomer cement.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal properties of calcium-based cement, Biodentine (Ca3SiO2), compared to commercial glass ionomer cements (GICs) and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pellets of GICs, ProRoot MTA, and Biodentine were prepared to test the influence of these cements on the growth of four oral microbial strains: Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans; using agar diffusion method. Wells were formed by removing the agar and the manipulated materials were immediately placed in the wells. The pellets were lodged in seeded plates and the growth inhibition diameter around the material was measured after 24-72 h incubation at 37 degrees C. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. RESULTS: Test indicates that the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine, on all the microorganisms tested, was very strong, showing a mean inhibition zone of 3.2 mm, which extends over time towards all the strains. For Biodentine, GIC, and MTA, the diameters of the inhibition zones for S. mutans were significantly larger than for E. faecalis, Candida, and E. coli (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for GIC on Candida. Largest inhibition zone was observed for Streptococcus group. Biodentine created larger inhibition zones than MTA and GIC.
TI  - Degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins in streptococci.
AB  - In prokaryotes, a conserved small RNA molecule, called tmRNA, rescues ribosomes from proteins that are abnormally truncated due to the presence of rare codons or degraded mRNA. During the rescue process, a peptide tag (SsrA) encoded by tmRNA is cotranslationally added to the truncated polypeptides, thereby targeting these proteins for proteolytic degradation. In Escherichia coli, ClpXP and ClpAP proteases primarily degrade SsrA-tagged proteins. Other proteases such as Lon and FtsH also participate in the degradation in E. coli. However, in Bacillus subtilis, ClpXP is the major protease that degrades the SsrA-tagged proteins. Degradation of SsrA-tagged protein in streptococci is not well understood except that ClpXP is responsible for the majority of the degradation. Here we show that in Streptococcus mutans, in addition to ClpXP, two other Clp complexes, ClpCP and ClpEP, are also involved in the degradation. We also found that ClpCP- and ClpEP-mediated proteolysis of SsrA-tagged substrates is induced by heat stress. As ClpCP and ClpEP proteins are highly conserved in streptococci, we predicted that ClpEP- and ClpCP-mediated degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins might be operational in other streptococci.
TI  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line MCF 7.
AB  - In the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of Solanum trilobatum. The aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. The bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. In addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (MCF 7) using MTT, nuclear morphology assay, Western blot and RT-PCR expression. These results taken together show the potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using S. trilobatum fruits.
TI  - Recent advances in natural product-based anti-biofilm approaches to control infections.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are highly organized surface-associated communities of bacteria encased within an extracellular matrix produced by themselves, capable of growing in connection with different biological or inert surfaces such as artificial joints or catheters. Biofilms are commonly associated with many health problems, such as endocarditis, otitis media, periodontitis, prostatitis, and urinary tract infections. Several bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or fungal pathogen as Candida albicans, can form biofilms in the body tissues, leading to different infections. The inherently defensive character of the biofilm is demonstrated by enhanced persistence of bacteria grown in the sessile mode respect to bacteria grown planktonically. This makes most biofilm- associated infections difficult to eradicate, thus contributing to disease chronicity. Since natural products provide a diverse array of chemical structures and possess a wide variety of biological properties, natural resources are worldwide exploited in the search of new pharmaceuticals. In this context bioactive secondary metabolites from natural sources, useful for the new antimicrobial and anti-biofilm drugs, are of interest. In this review, the role of small molecules from plants and marine organisms in inhibiting and/or dispersing bacterial biofilms is discussed, as well as the approaches that have been applied to the discovery of lead small molecules that mediate biofilm development. Molecules inhibiting the formation of biofilm may have therapeutic potential. Several candidates, as halogenated furanones, 2-amminoimidazole alkaloids and flavonoids have been already isolated and characterized from many plants and from marine organisms.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and mechanism of a novel hydroxyapatite whisker/nano zinc oxide biomaterial.
AB  - Postoperative infections remain a risk factor that leads to failures in oral and  maxillofacial artificial bone transplantation. This study aimed to synthesize and evaluate a novel hydroxyapatite whisker (HAPw) / nano zinc oxide (n-ZnO) antimicrobial bone restorative biomaterial. A scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize and analyze the material. Antibacterial capabilities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Streptococcus mutans were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and kinetic growth inhibition assays were performed under darkness and simulated solar irradiation. The mode of antibiotic action was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The MIC and MBC were 0.078-1.250 mg ml(-1) and 0.156-2.500 mg ml(-1), respectively. The inhibitory function on the growth of the microorganisms was achieved even under darkness, with gram-positive bacteria found to be more sensitive than gram-negative, and enhanced antimicrobial activity was exhibited under simulated solar excitation compared to darkness. TEM and CLSM images revealed a certain level of bacterial cell membrane destruction after treatment with 1 mg ml(-1) of the material for 12 h, causing the leakage of intracellular contents and bacteria death. These results suggest favorable antibiotic properties and a probable mechanism of the biomaterial for the first time, and further studies are needed to determine its potential application as a postoperative anti-inflammation method in bone transplantation.
TI  - Integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. Oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. While the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. By using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (Eschericia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. Staphylococcus aureus and A. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. They localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high numbers, and suppressed the growth of A. oris and S. mutants. Enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas E. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. In conclusion, it is possible for selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. Moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of Rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ethanolic extract of rose (Rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HCT 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The biologically synthesized AgNPs were also characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterized AgNPs showed an effective antibacterial activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) than Gram positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. MTT assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. In addition, green synthesized AgNPs also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (O2(-) and NO) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  - Guedes-Pinto paste is the filling material most employed in Brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the Rifocort(R) ointment has been removed. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace Rifocort(R) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: Nebacetin(R) ointment, 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate gel, and Maxitrol(R) ointment. A paste composed of Iodoform, Rifocort(R) ointment and Camphorated Paramonochlorophenol (CPC) was employed as the gold standard (G1). The other associations were: Iodoform, Nebacetin(R) ointment and CPC (G2); Iodoform, 2% Chlorhexidine Digluconate gel and CPC (G3); Iodoform, Maxitrol(R) ointment and CPC (G4). The associations were tested for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. The results were tested using statistical analysis ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis. They showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with G1. S. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of Tukey), insofar as G2 and G3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. All associations were bactericidal for E. coli, S. aureus, S. mutans and S. oralis. Only G3 and G4 were bactericidal for E. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for B. subtilis. Thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of PGLa-AM1, CPF-AM1, and magainin-AM1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (HDPs). Three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa-AM1), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AM1) and magainin-AM1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the African volcano frog Xenopus amieti (Pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. Minimal effective concentrations (MECs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by microbroth dilution. PGLa-AM1 and CPF-AM1 were particularly active against Streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. A type strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. PGLa-AM1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All three peptides showed less binding to P. gingivalis LPS than to LPS from the other species studied. Oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 muM peptide treatments. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 muM magainin-AM1 but not following treatment with PGLa-AM1 or CPF-AM1. In conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the X. amieti peptides bound to LPS from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. CPF-AM1 and PGLa-AM1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.
TI  - Application of chimeric glucanase comprising mutanase and dextranase for prevention of dental biofilm formation.
AB  - Water-insoluble glucan (WIG) produced by mutans streptococci, an important cariogenic pathogen, plays an important role in the formation of dental biofilm and adhesion of biofilm to tooth surfaces. Glucanohydrolases, such as mutanase (alpha-1,3-glucanase) and dextranase (alpha-1,6-glucanase), are able to hydrolyze WIG. The purposes of this study were to construct bi-functional chimeric glucanase, composed of mutanase and dextranase, and to examine the effects of this chimeric glucanase on the formation and decomposition of biofilm. The mutanase gene from Paenibacillus humicus NA1123 and the dextranase gene from Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were cloned and ligated into a pE-SUMOstar Amp plasmid vector. The resultant his-tagged fusion chimeric glucanase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and partially purified. The effects of chimeric glucanase on the formation and decomposition of biofilm formed on a glass surface by Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 glucosyltransferases were then examined. This biofilm was fractionated into firmly adherent, loosely adherent, and non-adherent WIG fractions. Amounts of WIG in each fraction were determined by a phenol-sulfuric acid method, and reducing sugars were quantified by the Somogyi-Nelson method. Chimeric glucanase reduced the formation of the total amount of WIG in a dose-dependent manner, and significant reductions of WIG in the adherent fraction were observed. Moreover, the chimeric glucanase was able to decompose biofilm, being 4.1 times more effective at glucan inhibition of biofilm formation than a mixture of dextranase and mutanase. These results suggest that the chimeric glucanase is useful for prevention of dental biofilm formation.
TI  - The role of the strictly conserved positively charged residue differs among the Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and chloroplast YidC homologs.
AB  - Recently, the structure of YidC2 from Bacillus halodurans revealed that the conserved positively charged residue within transmembrane segment one (at position 72) is located in a hydrophilic groove that is embedded in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The arginine residue was essential for the Bacillus subtilis SpoIIIJ (YidC1) to insert MifM and to complement a SpoIIIJ mutant strain. Here, we investigated the importance of the conserved positively charged residue for the function of the Escherichia coli YidC, Streptococcus mutans YidC2, and the chloroplast Arabidopsis thaliana Alb3. Like the Gram-positive B. subtilis SpoIIIJ, the conserved arginine was required for functioning of the Gram-positive S. mutans YidC2 and was necessary to complement the E. coli YidC depletion strain and to promote insertion of a YidC-dependent membrane protein synthesized with one but not two hydrophobic segments. In contrast, the conserved positively charged residue was not required for the E. coli YidC or the A. thaliana Alb3 to functionally complement the E. coli YidC depletion strain or to promote insertion of YidC-dependent membrane proteins. Our results also show that the C-terminal half of the helical hairpin structure in cytoplasmic loop C1 is important for the activity of YidC because various deletions in the region either eliminate or impair YidC function. The results here underscore the importance of the cytoplasmic hairpin region for YidC and show that the arginine is critical for the tested Gram-positive YidC homolog but is not essential for the tested Gram-negative and chloroplast YidC homologs.
TI  - [Complementation and function of methyl-metabolic pathway in Streptococcus mutans luxS null strain].
AB  - PURPOSE: To complement the activated methyl cycle (AMC) pathway at an AI-2 defect background in Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) luxS null strain. METHODS: A sahH gene was amplified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and introduced into the S. mutans luxS null strain to complement the methyl-metabolic disruption at an AI-2 defect background. Western blot, reverse-transcription PCR and AI-2 bioassay were performed to confirm the heterogenous expression of SahH in S. mutans luxS null strain. The data was statistically analyzed by SAS8.0 software package. RESULTS: LuxS and SahH were detected to express in Escherichia coli BL21 as well as their mRNA were confirmed to be successfully transcribed in S. mutans luxS null strain. AI-2 production was found in wide type S. mutans and its luxS-introduced luxS null strain but not found in the luxS null strain and its sahH and empty plasmid-introduced strains. CONCLUSIONS: A new S. mutans derivative with the AMC pathway complements while the AI-2 defect is constructed.
TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils extracted from Guatemalan medicinal plants.
AB  - CONTEXT: Essential oils are prevalent in many medicinal plants used for oral hygiene and treatment of diseases. OBJECTIVE: Medicinal plant species were extracted to determine the essential oil content. Those producing sufficient oil were screened for activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant samples were collected, frozen, and essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using a tube dilution assay for those species yielding sufficient oil. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the 141 plant species produced sufficient oil for collection and 12 species not previously reported to produce essential oils were identified. Essential oil extracts from 32 species exhibited activity against one or more microbes. Oils from eight species were highly inhibitory to S. mutans, four species were highly inhibitory to C. albicans, and 19 species yielded MIC values less than the reference drugs. DISCUSSION: RESULTS suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. Oils from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae), Citrus aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle (Rutaceae), Lippia graveolens Kunth (Verbenaceae), and Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: Teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. Oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of two root canal sealers: MTA Fillapex and AH 26.
AB  - AIM: Even after a complete root canal therapy, reinfection may occur as a result  of incomplete seal and activation of residual bacteria. Thus, antimicrobial activity is an important characteristic of root canal sealers. MTA Fillapex is a newly developed MTA-based sealer. It has been subjected to various studies evaluating its physical and chemical properties. In this study, we aimed to compare the antimicrobial activity of this sealer to the commonly known widely accepted sealer, AH26. METHODS: MTA Fillapex and AH 26 were exposed the bacterial suspension of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans after setting. After incubation and complete evaporation, BHI was added to microtubes. 24 hours later, the liquid content was placed in agar diffusion plate and bacterial count was performed. ANOVA followed by Tukey test, and t-Test were performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: With regard to all four bacterial groups, the bacterial count was significantly lower in MTAFillapex group comparing to AH 26 group. CONCLUSION: Newly developed MTA Fillapex sealer, has better antimicrobial properties in comparison to the widely accepted AH26 sealer.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of an experimental dentifrice based on Ricinus communis.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of a Ricinus communis-based experimental dentifrice for denture hygiene against the following standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay was performed with R. communis in pure oil at 2.5%. Only E. coli was not inhibited by R. communis, but the MIC (0.0781%) was effective against the other microorganisms. From these results it was determined the R. communis concentrations for experimental dentifrices, 1, 2, 5 and 10%, which were evaluated by the test-well diffusion in agar. The commercial dentifrices Colgate, Trihydral and Corega Brite were tested for comparative purposes. The diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a rule under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). Neither the commercial nor the experimental dentifrices were effective against E. coli. The experimental dentifrices containing R. communis at 2, 5 and 10% presented action against S. mutans, S. aureaus and E. faecallis. The experimental dentifrices showed no antimicrobial activity against Candida spp. and E. coli in any of the tested concentrations. Trihydral was the most effective. Comparing the experimental dentifrices, the product with 10% R. communis produced the largest zones of bacterial growth inhibition and had similar antimicrobial activity to the commercial dentifrices, except against S. aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of crude extract and metabolites of Phytolacca americana on  pathogens responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral cavity is the store house of different species of microorganisms that are continuously engaged in causing diseases in the mouth. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of crude extracts of the aerial parts of Phytolacca americana and its natural compounds against two oral pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans, which are primarily responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries, as well as a nonpathogenic Escherichia coli. METHODS: Crude extract and fractions from the aerial parts of P. americana (0.008-1.8 mg/mL) were evaluated for their potential antibacterial activity against two oral disease causing microorganisms by micro-assays. The standard natural compounds present in P. americana, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, isoqueritrin and ferulic acid, were also tested for their antibacterial activity against the pathogens at 1-8 mug/mL. RESULTS: The crude extract was highly active against P. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) and moderately active against S. mutans (44% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/mL. The chloroform and hexane fraction controlled the growth of P. gingivalis with 91% and 92% growth inhibition at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. Kaempferol exerted antibacterial activity against both the pathogens, whereas quercetin showed potent growth inhibition activity against only S. mutans in a concentration dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The crude extract, chloroform fraction, and hexane fraction of P. americana possesses active natural compounds that can inhibit the growth of oral disease causing bacteria. Thus, these extracts have the potential for use in the preparation of toothpaste and other drugs related to various oral diseases.
TI  - A microbiological assessment of the oral hygiene of 24-72-month-old kindergarten  children and disinfection of their toothbrushes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF-T), habit of brushing teeth, and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution, then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children's parents. METHOD: Included in the study were 187 children (96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months. The children selected had not taken any antibiotics, antimicotics for three months and dental treatments during this trial. The distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly. After performing a survey for the education, occupation, and income status of the parents, the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded. The children were given toothbrushes, toothpaste (with fluroide), and the solutions (including distilled water and chlorhexidine) for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of each week. The 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period. RESULTS: The decrease in the DMF-T index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education, income, and occupation status of the parents. Of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes, the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia Coli, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Enterococcus spp, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Except for Candida albicans, the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall. In the group using the solution with chlorhexidine, a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that the education, occupation, and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children's oral and dental health. Moreover, the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health.
TI  - Effectiveness of alternative methods for toothbrush disinfection: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative methods  for toothbrush disinfection. METHODS: Two-hundred eighty toothbrushes were included in the study. The toothbrushes were divided into 7 groups and were contaminated by standardized suspensions of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The following disinfectants were tested: 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 100% and 50% white vinegar, microwave (MW) oven, ultraviolet (UV) sanitizer, and mouth rinse-containing propolis (MCP). Data were analyzed with Kruskal Wallis and Dunn's tests. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between different methods and control group for all tested bacteria. There were statistically significant differences between all test groups for all microorganisms. MW was the most effective for L. rhamnosus and 100% white vinegar was the most effective method for S. mutans and S. aureus. NaOCl was the most effective for E. coli. CONCLUSION: This study showed that 100% white vinegar was considered to be effective for tested microorganisms. Similarly, 1% NaOCl is cost-effective, easily accessible, and comparatively effective for toothbrush disinfection. Because these agents are nontoxic, cost-effective and easily accessible, they may be appropriate for household use.
TI  - The disinfection of impression materials by using microwave irradiation and hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Microwave irradiation and immersion in solutions have been  recommended for denture disinfection. However, the effect of dry conditions and impression materials has not been completely evaluated. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of microwave irradiation and hydrogen peroxide for the disinfection of dental impression materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens (diameter 10 mm, thickness 2 mm) were made with polyvinyl siloxane. Experimental groups were treated with hydrogen peroxide (group H), microwave irradiation (group M), and a combination of both hydrogen peroxide and microwave irradiation (group MH) for 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 3 minutes. The control group was untreated. The total sample size was 120. The specimens were divided into 2 groups, those exposed to Streptococcus mutans and those exposed to Escherichia coli. The disinfection effect and physical properties (contact angle, compatibility with gypsum, strain in compression, tear strength) were evaluated. RESULTS: All 3 groups (H, M, MH) were effective in reducing the number of colony forming units (CFU) per unit volume (mL) for both S mutans and E coli compared with the control. The most significant reduction in the CFU/mL of both bacteria was noted in the MH group and was used to compare either treatment alone (P<.05). No statistically significant difference was noted between the control and treatment groups in terms of all of the physical properties tested (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Microwave irradiation was identified as a useful disinfection method against S mutans and E coli, especially when combined with H2O2, without adversely affecting the physical properties of dental impression materials.
TI  - Bacterial resistance of self-assembled surfaces using PPOm-b-PSBMAn zwitterionic  copolymer - concomitant effects of surface topography and surface chemistry on attachment of live bacteria.
AB  - Three well-defined diblock copolymers made of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (poly(SBMA)) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) groups were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method. They were physically adsorbed onto three types of surfaces having different topography, including smooth flat surface, convex surface, and indented surface. Chemical state of surfaces was characterized by XPS while the various topographies were examined by SEM and AFM. Hydrophilicity of surfaces was dependent on both the surface chemistry and the surface topography, suggesting that orientation of copolymer brushes can be tuned in the design of surfaces aimed at resisting bacterial attachment. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli with green fluorescent protein (E. coli GFP) were used in bacterial tests to assess the resistance to bacterial attachment of poly(SBMA)-covered surfaces. Results highlighted a drastic improvement of resistance to bacterial adhesion with the increasing of poly(SBMA) to PPO ratio, as well as an important effect of surface topography. The chemical effect was directly related to the length of the hydrophilic moieties. When longer, more water could be entrapped, leading to improved anti-bacterial properties. The physical effect impacted on the orientation of the copolymer brushes, as well as on the surface contact area available. Convex surfaces as well as indented surfaces wafer presented the best resistance to bacterial adhesion. Indeed, bacterial attachment was more importantly reduced on these surfaces compared with smooth surfaces. It was explained by the non-orthogonal orientation of copolymer brushes, resulting in a more efficient surface coverage of zwitterionic molecules. This work suggests that not only the control of surface chemistry is essential in the preparation of surfaces resisting bacterial attachment, but also the control of surface topography and orientation of antifouling moieties.
TI  - Antibiotic-decorated titanium with enhanced antibacterial activity through adhesive polydopamine for dental/bone implant.
AB  - Implant-associated infections, which are normally induced by microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, practical approaches to prevent implant-associated infections are in great demand. Inspired by adhesive proteins in mussels, here we have developed a novel antibiotic-decorated titanium (Ti) material with enhanced antibacterial activity. In this study, Ti substrate was coated by one-step pH-induced polymerization of dopamine followed by immobilization of the antibiotic cefotaxime sodium (CS) onto the polydopamine-coated Ti through catechol chemistry. Contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of CS grafted on the Ti surface. Our results demonstrated that the antibiotic-grafted Ti substrate showed good biocompatibility and well-behaved haemocompatibility. In addition, the antibiotic-grafted Ti could effectively prevent adhesion and proliferation of Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Streptococcus mutans (Gram-positive). Moreover, the inhibition of biofilm formation on the antibiotic-decorated Ti indicated that the grafted CS could maintain its long-term antibacterial activity. This modified Ti substrate with enhanced antibacterial activity holds great potential as implant material for applications in dental and bone graft substitutes.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against five microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the MIC, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. RESULTS: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (P < 0.01). Paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (P < 0.01). The chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower MICs than did the green tea mouthrinse (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.
TI  - Photosensitization of in vitro biofilms formed on denture base resin.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Proper sterilization or disinfection of removable prostheses and surgical guides has been problematic in dental practice because of the absence of simple and low-cost techniques that do not cause damage to acrylic resins. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to study the effect of photodynamic therapy against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The specimens were sterilized in ethylene oxide gas and submitted to in vitro biofilm growth. The photodynamic therapy consisted of the application of 0.05% methylene blue (P+) conjugated to irradiation with a light-emitting-diode of 630 nm and 150 mW (L+). The specimens were randomly divided into groups (n=5): negative control (P-L-); stained and irradiated at 10 J/cm(2) (P+L+ 10); stained and irradiated at 30 J/cm(2) (P+L+ 30); stained and not irradiated (P+L-); not stained and irradiated at 10 J/cm(2) (P-L+ 10); not stained and irradiated at 30 J/cm(2) (P-L+ 30); and gold standard (GS), sterilized. Afterward, the specimens were submitted to contact with culture medium agar for 10 minutes in petri plates, which were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C. The number of colony-forming units was obtained, and the data were expressed according to scores (1=0; 2=1-10; 3=11-100; 4=101-1000) and analyzed by the Friedman and Dunn tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Streptococcus mutans was sensitized by (P+L-); P aeruginosa and C albicans were also sensitized by the dye but showed a slight microbial reduction with (P+L+ 30), as did S aureus (P>.05); E coli presented an initial score of 3 and achieved a bacterial reduction to score 2 with (P+L+ 30) (P=.039). CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy was effective in reducing E coli counts on biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. The inhibition of microorganism growth tended to be directly proportional to the amount of energy provided by the light-emitting diode.
TI  - Investigations of kanuka and manuka essential oils for in vitro treatment of disease and cellular inflammation caused by infectious microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diseases caused by infectious and inflammatory microorganisms are among the most common and most severe nosocomial diseases worldwide. Therefore, developing effective agents for treating these illnesses is critical. In this study, essential oils from two tea tree species, kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) and manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), were evaluated for use in treating diseases and inflammation caused by microorganism infection. METHODS: Isolates of clinically common bacteria and fungi were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and from Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for Trichosporon mucoides, Malassezia furfur, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis were determined by the broth microdilution method with Sabouraud dextrose broth. The antibacterial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, and Escherichia coli were determined by the broth microdilution method. A human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was cultured to test the effects of the essential oils on the release of the two inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4. RESULTS: Multiple analyses of microorganism growth confirmed that both essential oils significantly inhibited four fungi and the four bacteria. The potent fungicidal properties of the oils were confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.78% to 3.13%. The oils also showed excellent bactericidal qualities with 100% inhibition of the examined bacteria. In THP-1 cells, both oils lowered tumor necrosis factor-alpha released after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Finally, the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of the oils were obtained without adversely affecting the immune system. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the potent antimicroorganism and anti-inflammation properties of kanuka and manuka essential oils make them strong candidates for use in treating infections and immune-related disease. The data confirm the potential use of kanuka and manuka extracts as pharmaceutical antibiotics, medical cosmetology agents, and food supplements.
TI  - Improving poly-3-hydroxybutyrate production in Escherichia coli by combining the  increase in the NADPH pool and acetyl-CoA availability.
AB  - The biosynthesis of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), a biodegradable bio-plastic, requires acetyl-CoA as precursor and NADPH as cofactor. Escherichia coli has been used as a heterologous production model for P3HB, but metabolic pathway analysis shows a deficiency in maintaining high levels of NADPH and that the acetyl-CoA is mainly converted to acetic acid by native pathways. In this work the pool of NADPH was increased 1.7-fold in E. coli MG1655 through plasmid overexpression of the NADP(+)-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gapN) from Streptococcus mutans (pTrcgapN). Additionally, by deleting the main acetate production pathway (ackA-pta), the acetic acid production was abolished, thus increasing the acetyl-CoA pool. The P3HB biosynthetic pathway was heterologously expressed in strain MG1655 Deltaack-pta/pTrcgapN, using an IPTG inducible vector with the P3HB operon from Azotobacter vinelandii (pPHB Av ). Cultures were performed in controlled fermentors using mineral medium with glucose as the carbon source. Accordingly, the mass yield of P3HB on glucose increased to 73 % of the maximum theoretical and was 30 % higher when compared to the progenitor strain (MG1655/pPHB Av ). In comparison with the wild type strain expressing pPHB Av , the specific accumulation of PHB (gPHB/gDCW) in MG1655 Deltaack-pta/pTrcgapN/pPHB Av increased twofold, indicating that as the availability of NADPH is raised and the production of acetate abolished, a P3HB intracellular accumulation of up to 84 % of the E. coli dry weight is attainable.
TI  - Structural genomics studies of human caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans is the primary causative agent of human dental caries. To better understand this pathogen at the atomic structure level and to establish potential drug and vaccine targets, we have carried out structural genomics research since 2005. To achieve the goal, we have developed various in-house automation systems including novel high-throughput crystallization equipment and methods, based on which a large-scale, high-efficiency and low-cost platform has been establish in our laboratory. From a total of 1,963 annotated open reading frames, 1,391 non-membrane targets were selected prioritized by protein sequence similarities to unknown structures, and clustered by restriction sites to allow for cost-effective high-throughput conventional cloning. Selected proteins were over-expressed in different strains of Escherichia coli. Clones expressed soluble proteins were selected, expanded, and expressed proteins were purified and subjected to crystallization trials. Finally, protein crystals were subjected to X-ray analysis and structures were determined by crystallographic methods. Using the previously established procedures, we have so far obtained more than 200 kinds of protein crystals and 100 kinds of crystal structures involved in different biological pathways. In this paper we demonstrate and review a possibility of performing structural genomics studies at moderate laboratory scale. Furthermore, the techniques and methods developed in our study can be widely applied to conventional structural biology research practice.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - A unique F-type H(+)-ATPase from Streptococcus mutans: an active H(+) pump at acidic pH.
AB  - We have shown previously that the Streptococcus mutans F-type H(+)-ATPase (F(O)F(1)) c subunit gene could complement Escherichia coli defective in the corresponding gene, particularly at acidic pH (Araki et al., (2013) [14]). In this study, the entire S. mutans F(O)F(1) was functionally assembled in the E. coli plasma membrane (SF(O)F(1)). Membrane SF(O)F(1) ATPase showed optimum activity at pH 7, essentially the same as that of the S. mutans, although the activity of E. coli F(O)F(1) (EF(O)F(1)) was optimum at pH>/=9. The membranes showed detectable ATP-dependent H(+)-translocation at pH 5.5-6.5, but not at neutral conditions (pH>/=7), consistent with the role of S. mutans F(O)F(1) to pump H(+) out of the acidic cytoplasm. A hybrid F(O)F(1), consisting of membrane-integrated F(O) and -peripheral F(1) sectors from S. mutans and E. coli (SF(O)EF(1)), respectively, essentially showed the same pH profile as that of EF(O)F(1) ATPase. However, ATP-driven H(+)-transport was similar to that by SF(O)F(1), with activity at acidic pH. Replacement of the conserved c subunit Glu53 in SF(O)F(1) abolished H(+)-transport at pH 6 or 7, suggesting its role in H(+) transport. Mutations in the SF(O)F(1) c subunit, Ser17Ala or Glu20Ile, changed the pH dependency of H(+)-transport, and the F(O) could transport H(+) at pH 7, as the membranes with EF(O)F(1). Ser17, Glu20, and their vicinity were suggested to be involved in H(+)-transport in S. mutans at acidic pH.
TI  - Prolonged delivery of ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium from a polymeric fibre  device for the treatment of periodontal disease.
AB  - In vitro analysis of drug release and antimicrobial activity of the coblended crosslinked polymeric fibre device (PFD) were investigated. The fibre loaded with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium was comprised of alginate and glycerol crosslinked with barium cations. The pH dependent drug release was evident with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium diffusing from the fibre at pH 4.0 compared to pH 6.8, where the fibre swelled and eroded resulting in zero-order drug release. Agar diffusion studies followed by minimum inhibitory assays were conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the device against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. The antimicrobial activity of the PFD was confirmed in both test assays against all test pathogens. The MIC ranges at pH 4.0 for E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. mutans were 0.5-0.8, 0.4-1.1, and 0.7-2.1 mug/mL, respectively. At pH 6.8, similar efficacies (0.3-0.5 mug/mL for E. coli and E. faecalis and 0.6-1.0 mug/mL for S. mutans) were observed. The effect of varying the plasticizer and crosslinking ion concentration on drug release profile of the fibers was further elucidated and conceptualized using molecular mechanics energy relationships (MMER) and by exploring the spatial disposition of geometrically minimized molecular conformations.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - Photopolymerizable phosphate acrylates as comonomers in dental adhesives with or  without triclosan monomer units.
AB  - Phosphate diacrylates (CO-DAP, TMP-DAP) based on castor oil or trimethylolpropane were synthesized and evaluated in dental adhesive formulations in comparison with 3-acryloyloxy-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate phosphate (AMP-P). In an attempt to promote antibacterial activity, another photopolymerizable monomer (TCS-UMA) containing 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol moiety (triclosan) was prepared and incorporated in adhesive resins. Each of these monomers had a molecular structure confirmed by spectral methods. The photopolymerization rates for monomers (0.063-0.088s(-1)) were lower than those determined in the monomer combinations (0.116-0.158s(-1)) incorporating phosphate diacrylate (11wt.%), BisGMA (33wt.%), TEGDMA (10wt.%), UDMA (10wt.%) and HEMA (15wt.%), the degree of conversion varying between 63.4 and 74.5%. The formed copolymers showed high values for water sorption (18.65-57.02mug/mm(3)) and water solubility (3.51-13.38mug/mm(3)), and the contact angle was dependent on the presence of CO-DAP (thetaF1: 66.67 degrees ), TMP-DAP (thetaF2: 55.05 degrees ) or AMP-P (thetaF3: 52.90 degrees ) in the photocrosslinked specimens compared to the sample without phosphate monomer (thetaF4: 82.14 degrees ). The scanning electron microscopy image of the dentin-resin composite interface after applying our F1 formulation (pH: 4.1) and its light-curing for 20s supports the evidence of the formation of the hybrid layer with the tooth structure created by self-etching approach, with no gaps or cracks in the adhesive. A comparative analysis of the adhesion achieved with commercial adhesive systems (Single Bond Universal, C-Bond) rather indicates similarities than differences between them. The addition of triclosan methacrylate (1wt.%) into the formulation inhibited the bacterial growth of the Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli in the direct contact area due to the covalently linked antibacterial monomer.
TI  - Protective role of the neuropeptide urocortin II against experimental sepsis and  leishmaniasis by direct killing of pathogens.
AB  - We currently face an alarming resurgence in infectious diseases characterized by  antimicrobial resistance and therapeutic failure. This has generated the urgent need of developing new therapeutic approaches that include agents with nontraditional modes of action. A recent interest focused on approaches based on our natural immune defenses, especially on peptides that combine innate antimicrobial activity against diverse pathogens and immunoregulatory functions. In this study, to our knowledge, we describe for the first time the antimicrobial activity of the neuropeptide urocortin II (UCNII) against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and tropical parasites of the genus Leishmania. Importantly, this cytotoxicity was selective for pathogens, because UCNII did not affect mammalian cell viability. Structurally, UCNII has a cationic and amphipathic design that resembles antimicrobial peptides. Using mutants and UCNII fragments, we determined the structural requirements for the interaction between the peptide and the surface of pathogen. Following its binding to pathogen, UCNII caused cell death through different membrane-disrupting mechanisms that involve aggregation and membrane depolarization in bacteria and pore formation in Leishmania. Noteworthily, UCNII killed the infective form of Leishmania major even inside the infected macrophages. Consequently, UCNII prevented mortality caused by polymicrobial sepsis and ameliorated pathological signs of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Besides its presence in body physical and mucosal barriers, we found that innate immune cells produce UCNII in response to infections. Therefore, UCNII could be considered as an ancient highly-conserved host peptide involved in the natural antimicrobial defense and emerge as an attractive alternative to current treatments for microbial disorders with associated drug resistances.
TI  - Photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based TiO2 nanocomposites after cessation of UV irradiation.
AB  - Photocatalysis induced by TiO2 and UV light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. The present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the cessation of UV irradiation. We show that resin-based composites containing 20% TiO2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against the pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post UV. For biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct UV illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of Indigofera trita Linn.
AB  - An in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of Indigofera trita L. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. A total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and 2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. Petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), Salmonella paratyphi A (12.80 mm), Streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhi and Burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). The chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), S. typhimurium (12.60 mm), S. paratyphi A, S. brunei and Yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). The acetone extract of I. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against S. epidermidis (18.20 mm), S. typhimurium (14.60 mm), S. infantis (13.80 mm), S. aureus (13.40 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and Enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. Ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (18.60 mm), S. paratyphi A (14.60 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), S. typhi (12.40 mm), S. aureus, E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium and S. infantis (12.00 mm). Aqueous extract of I. trita considerably inhibited S. epidermidis (13.80 mm), S. paratyphi A and Y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), E. aerogenes and Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). All the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. The result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of I. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.
TI  - [Experimental evaluation of the spraying disinfection efficiency on dental models].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the disinfect effect after spraying a new kind of disinfectant on the dental plaster models. METHODS: The germ-free plaster samples, which were smeared with bacteria compound including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces albicans, Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus were sprayed with disinfectants (CaviCide) and glutaraldehyde individually. In one group(5 minutes later) and another group(15 minutes later), the colonies were counted for statistical analysis after sampling, inoculating, and culturing which were used for evaluation of disinfecting efficiency. ANOVA was performed using SPSS12.0 software package. RESULTS: All sample bacteria were eradicated after spraying disinfectants(CaviCide) within 5 minutes and effective bacteria control was retained after 15 minutes. There was significant difference between the disinfecting efficiency of CaviCide and glutaraldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of disinfection with spraying disinfectants (CaviCide) on dental models is quick and effective.
TI  - Microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
AB  - The present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. The product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). These molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). The structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and three Gram-negative bacteria viz., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL) cell line. In general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. The coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (R = i-Pr, R(1) = 6-Cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/mL.
TI  - Application of PNA openers for fluorescence-based detection of bacterial DNA.
AB  - Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) openers have the unique ability to invade double-stranded DNA with high efficiency and sequence specificity, making it possible to detect short (about 20 bp), single-copy bacterial DNA sequences. PNA openers bind to a target signature site on one strand of bacterial DNA, leaving the other strand open for hybridization with a circularizable oligonucleotide probe. The assembled complex serves as a template for rolling circle amplification. The obtained amplicon is decorated with short, single-stranded DNA probes carrying fluorophores and detected via fluorescence microscopy.
TI  - Disinfection protocols to prevent cross-contamination between dental offices and  prosthetic laboratories.
AB  - Control of cross-contamination between dental offices and prosthetic laboratories is of utmost importance to maintain the health of patients and dental office staff. The purpose of this study was to evaluate disinfection protocols, considering antimicrobial effectiveness and damage to the structures of prostheses. Solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% vinegar and sodium perborate were evaluated. Specimens were contaminated in vitro with standardized suspensions of Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis spores. Disinfection by immersion for 10 min was performed. Final counts of microorganisms were obtained using the plating method. Results were statistically compared by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Dunn's test. The surface roughness of 40 specimens was analyzed before and after 10 disinfection cycles, and results were compared statistically using Student's t test. The solution of 50% vinegar was as effective as 1% sodium hypochlorite and 2% chlorhexidine against C. albicans, E. coli and S. mutans. The sodium perborate solution showed the lowest antimicrobial effectiveness. Superficial roughness increased after cycles in 1% sodium hypochlorite (p=0.02). Solutions of 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine and 50% vinegar were effective for the disinfection of heat-polymerized acrylic specimens. Sodium hypochlorite increased the superficial roughness.
TI  - Metabolic and transcriptional response of Escherichia coli with a NADP(+)-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The NAD(+)-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (NAD(+)-GAPDH) is a key enzyme to sustain the glycolytic function in Escherichia coli and to generate NADH. In the absence of NAD(+)-GAPDH activity, the glycolytic function can be restored through NADP(+)-dependent GAPDH heterologous expression. Here, some metabolic and transcriptional effects are described when the NAD(+)-GAPDH gene from E. coli (gapA) is replaced with the NADP(+)-GAPDH gene from Streptococcus mutans (gapN). Expression of gapN was controlled by the native gapA promoter (E. coliDeltagapA::gapN) or by the constitutive trc promoter in a multicopy plasmid (E. coliDeltagapA::gapN/pTrcgapN). The specific NADP(+)-GAPDH activity was 4.7 times higher in E. coliDeltagapA::gapN/pTrcgapN than E. coliDeltagapA::gapN. Growth, glucose consumption and acetic acid production rates increased in agreement with the NADP(+)-GAPDH activity level. Analysis of E. coliDeltagapA::gapN/pTrcgapN showed that although gapN expression complemented NAD(+)-GAPDH activity, the resulting low NADH levels decreased the expression of the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation genes (ndh, cydA, cyoB and atpA). In comparison with the wild type strain, E. coliDeltagapA::gapN/pTrcgapN decreased the percentage of mole of oxygen consumed per mole of glucose metabolized by 40 % with a concomitant reduction of 54 % in the ATP/ADP ratio. The cellular response to avoid NADPH excess led to the overexpression of the transhydrogenase coded by udhA and the down-regulation of the pentose-phosphate and Krebs cycle genes, which reduced the CO2 production and increased the acetic acid synthesis. The E. coli strains obtained in this work can be useful for future metabolic engineering efforts aiming for the production of metabolites which biosynthesis depends on NADPH.
TI  - Functional ginger extracts from supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction via in vitro and in vivo assays: antioxidation, antimicroorganism, and mice xenografts models.
AB  - Supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction technology was developed to gain the active components from a Taiwan native plant, Zingiber officinale (ginger). We studied the biological effects of ginger extracts via multiple assays and demonstrated the biofunctions in each platform. Investigations of ginger extracts indicated antioxidative properties in dose-dependant manners on radical scavenging activities, reducing powers and metal chelating powers. We found that ginger extracts processed moderate scavenging values, middle metal chelating levels, and slight ferric reducing powers. The antibacterial susceptibility of ginger extracts on Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, and Escherichia coli was determined with the broth microdilution method technique. The ginger extracts had operative antimicroorganism potentials against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We further discovered the strong inhibitions of ginger extracts on lethal carcinogenic melanoma through in vivo xenograft model. To sum up, the data confirmed the possible applications as medical cosmetology agents, pharmaceutical antibiotics, and food supplements.
TI  - Complementation of the Fo c subunit of Escherichia coli with that of Streptococcus mutans and properties of the hybrid FoF1 ATP synthase.
AB  - The c subunit of Streptococcus mutans ATP synthase (FoF1) is functionally exchangeable with that of Escherichia coli, since E. coli with a hybrid FoF1 is able to grow on minimum succinate medium through oxidative phosphorylation. E. coli F1 bound to the hybrid Fo with the S. mutans c subunit showed N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive ATPase activity similar to that of E. coli FoF1. Thus, the S. mutans c subunit assembled into a functional Fo together with the E. coli a and b subunits, forming a normal F1 binding site. Although the H(+) pathway should be functional, as was suggested by the growth on minimum succinate medium, ATP-driven H(+) transport could not be detected with inverted membrane vesicles in vitro. This observation is partly explained by the presence of an acidic residue (Glu-20) in the first transmembrane helix of the S. mutans c subunit, since the site-directed mutant carrying Gln-20 partly recovered the ATP-driven H(+) transport. Since S. mutans is recognized to be a primary etiological agent of human dental caries and is one cause of bacterial endocarditis, our system that expresses hybrid Fo with the S. mutans c subunit would be helpful to find antibiotics and chemicals specifically directed to S. mutans.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  - Treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. Ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of BioAggregate (BA) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the standard strains of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. Colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. Petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or Sabouraud dextrose agar (for C.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and BA and MTA discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. The results of the disc diffusion tests showed that BA and MTA were effective on the tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. BA and MTA showed similar antimicrobial effects on C.albicans and E.coli. BA was more effective than MTA on S.mutans, E.faecalis and P.aeruginosa, however MTA was more effective than BA on S.sanguinis at 48 hours. When the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on E.coli, E.faecalis, S.mutans, S.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). There was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on C.albicans in BA and MTA groups and P.aeruginosa in BA group (p< 0.05). It can be concluded that although BA and MTA displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms newly improved material BA demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.
TI  - Silver nanoparticles as active ingredient used for alcohol-free mouthwash.
AB  - We developed an effective and non-irritant mouthwash that is alcohol-free and has a low concentration of silver nanoparticles (SNP) in order to be used for preventing oral cavity infections in immunocompromised oncologic patients. We studied antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (SNP) in the range of (50-0.024 microg/ml) and 3% of ethanol (30,000 microg/ml) in mouthwash. Antimicrobial effects of two treatments were studied by doing challenge test on microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and measuring MIC and MBC (MFC) values of SNP toward mentioned microorganisms. These values of SNP respectively were in the range of (0.78-3.12) and (1.56-12.5 microg/ml). Results showed that SNP in the MIC and the lower concentrations killed all of the used microorganisms. No difference was observed between the antimicrobial effect of ethanol-free mouthwash containing SNP and mouthwash containing SNP and ethanol (30,000 microg/ml). SNP has high antimicrobial effects at low concentrations and it can be a good alternative for ethanol (30,000 microg/ml) because ethanol is also irritating, especially to sensitive or inflamed mucosa.
TI  - Application of lipopeptide biosurfactant isolated from a halophile: Bacillus tequilensis CH for inhibition of biofilm.
AB  - Biosurfactants are amphiphilic molecules having hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties produced by various microorganisms. These molecules trigger the reduction of surface tension or interfacial tension in liquids. A biosurfactant-producing halophile was isolated from Lake Chilika, a brackish water lake of Odisha, India (19 degrees 41'39''N, 85 degrees 18'24''E). The halophile was identified as Bacillus tequilensis CH by biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and assigned accession no. KC851857 by GenBank. The biosurfactant produced by B. tequilensis CH was partially characterized as a lipopeptide using thin-layer chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The minimum effective concentration of a biosurfactant for inhibition of pathogenic biofilm (Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans) on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was found to be 50 mug ml(-1). This finding has potential for a variety of applications.
TI  - Interaction of Streptococcus mutans YidC1 and YidC2 with translating and nontranslating ribosomes.
AB  - The YidC/OxaI/Alb3 family of membrane proteins is involved in the biogenesis of integral membrane proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Gram-positive bacteria often contain multiple YidC paralogs that can be subdivided into two major classes, namely, YidC1 and YidC2. The Streptococcus mutans YidC1 and YidC2 proteins possess C-terminal tails that differ in charges (+9 and + 14) and lengths (33 and 61 amino acids). The longer YidC2 C terminus bears a resemblance to the C-terminal ribosome-binding domain of the mitochondrial OxaI protein and, in contrast to the shorter YidC1 C terminus, can mediate the interaction with mitochondrial ribosomes. These observations have led to the suggestion that YidC1 and YidC2 differ in their abilities to interact with ribosomes. However, the interaction with bacterial translating ribosomes has never been addressed. Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli ribosomes are able to interact with both YidC1 and YidC2. The interaction is stimulated by the presence of a nascent membrane protein substrate and abolished upon deletion of the C-terminal tail, which also abrogates the YidC-dependent membrane insertion of subunit c of the F1F0-ATPase into the membrane. It is concluded that both YidC1 and YidC2 interact with ribosomes, suggesting that the modes of membrane insertion by these membrane insertases are similar.
TI  - A simple bacterial transformation method using magnesium- and calcium-aminoclays.
AB  - An efficient and user-friendly bacterial transformation method by simple spreading cells with aminoclays was demonstrated. Compared to the reported transformation approaches using DNA adsorption or wrapping onto (in)organic fibers, the spontaneously generated clay-coated DNA suprastructures by mixing DNA with aminoclay resulted in transformants in both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive cells (Streptococcus mutans). Notably, the wild type S. mutans showed comparable transformation efficiency to that of the E. coli host for recombinant DNA cloning. This is a potentially promising result because other trials such as heat-shock, electroporation, and treatment with sepiolite for introducing DNA into the wild type S. mutans failed. Under defined conditions, the transformation efficiency of E. coli XL1-Blue and S. mutans exhibited ~2 x 10(5) and ~6 x 10(3)CFU/mug of plasmid DNA using magnesium-aminoclay. In contrast, transformation efficiency was higher in S. mutans than that in E. coli XL1-Blue for calcium-aminoclay. It was also confirmed that each plasmid transformed into E. coli and S. mutans was stably maintained and that they expressed the inserted gene encoding the green fluorescent protein during prolonged growth of up to 80 generations.
TI  - Designing antimicrobial bioactive glass materials with embedded metal ions synthesized by the sol-gel method.
AB  - Bioactive glasses (SiO2-P2O5-CaO) having tailored concentrations of different biocide metal ions (copper or silver) were produced by the sol-gel method. All the particles release phosphorous ions when immersed in water and simulated body fluid (SBF). Moreover, a surface layer of polycrystalline hydroxy-carbonate apatite was formed on the particle surfaces after 10 day immersion in SBF as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showing the bioactive materials. Samples with embedded either copper or silver ions were able to further release the biocide ions with a release rate that depends on the metal embedded and the dissolution medium: water or SBF. This biocide ion release from the samples explains the antimicrobial effect of our active particles against Escherichia coli DH5alpha ampicillin-resistant (Gram-negative) and Streptococcus mutans (Gram-positive) as determined by the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) method. The antimicrobial behavior of the particles depends on the bacteria and the biocide ion used. Noteworthy, although samples with copper are able to release more metal ion than samples with silver, they present higher MBC showing the high effect of silver against these bacteria.
TI  - Inhibition of initial adhesion of oral bacteria through a lectin from Bauhinia variegata L. var. variegata expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present work was to study the in vitro effect of native and  recombinant Bauhinia variegata var. variegata lectins in inhibiting early adhesion of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus sobrinus to experimentally acquired pellicle. METHODS AND RESULTS: Native lectin from B. variegata (BVL) was purified by affinity chromatography of extract of seeds. The recombinant lectin (rBVL-I) was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) from a genomic clone encoding the mature B. variegata lectin gene using the vector pAE-bvlI. Recombinant protein deposited in inclusion bodies was solubilized and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. The rBVL-I was compared to BVL for agglutination of erythrocytes and initial adherence of oral bacteria on a saliva-coated surface. The results revealed that rBVL-I acts similarly to BVL for agglutination of erythrocytes. Both lectins showed adhesion inhibition effect on Step. sanguis, Step. mutans and Step. sobrinus. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, the inhibition of early adhesion of oral bacteria by a recombinant lectin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results support the proposed biotechnological application of lectins in a strategy to reduce development of dental caries by inhibiting the initial adhesion and biofilm formation.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray study of the deaminase AmnE from Pseudomonas sp. AP-3.
AB  - The amnE gene from Pseudomonas sp. AP-3 has been verified as encoding a deaminase with 142 amino-acid residues. In order to change the substrate specificity via structure-based protein engineering, the amnE gene, after gene-code optimization, was chemically synthesized and cloned into the expression vector pET-28a. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni(2+)-chelating affinity chromatography. Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to a resolution of 2.09 A. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group C2221, with unit-cell parameters a = 63.23, b = 88.93, c = 137.83 A.
TI  - Inhibition of pathogenic bacterial biofilm by biosurfactant produced by Lysinibacillus fusiformis S9.
AB  - A biosurfactant producing microbe isolated from a river bank was identified as Lysinibacillus fusiformis S9. It was identified with help of biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. The biosurfactant S9BS produced was purified and characterized as glycolipid. The biosurfactant showed remarkable inhibition of biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans. It was interesting to note that at concentration of 40 mug ml(-1) the biosurfactant did not show any bactericidal activity but restricted the biofilm formation completely. L. fusiformis is reported for the first time to produce a glycolipid type of biosurfactant capable of inhibiting biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria. The biosurfactant inhibited bacterial attachment and biofilm formation equally well on hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic surfaces like glass and catheter tubing. This property is significant in many biomedical applications where the molecule should help in preventing biofouling of surfaces without being toxic to biotic system.
TI  - Cloning-independent plasmid construction for genetic studies in streptococci.
AB  - Shuttle plasmids are among the few routinely utilized tools in the Streptococcus  mutans genetic system that still require the use of classical cloning methodologies and intermediate hosts for genetic manipulation. Accordingly, it typically requires considerably less time and effort to introduce mutations onto the S. mutans chromosome than it does to construct shuttle vectors for expressing genes in trans. Occasionally, shuttle vector constructs also exhibit toxicity in Escherichia coli, which prevents their proper assembly. To circumvent these limitations, we modified a prolonged overlap extension PCR (POE-PCR) protocol to facilitate direct plasmid assembly in S. mutans. Using solely PCR, we created the reporter vector pZX7, which contains a single minimal streptococcal replication origin and harbors a spectinomycin resistance cassette and the gusA gene encoding beta-glucuronidase. We compared the efficiency of pZX7 assembly using multiple strains of S. mutans and were able to obtain from 5 x 10(3) to 2 x 10(5) CFU/mug PCR product. Likewise, we used pZX7 to further demonstrate that Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii are also excellent hosts for cloning-independent plasmid assembly, which suggests that this system is likely to function in numerous other streptococci. Consequently, it should be possible to completely forgo the use of E. coli-Streptococcus shuttle vectors in many streptococcal species, thereby decreasing the time and effort required to assemble constructs and eliminating any toxicity issues associated with intermediate hosts.
TI  - A Chimeric UDP-Glucose Pyrophosphorylase Produced by Protein Engineering Exhibits Sensitivity to Allosteric Regulators.
AB  - In bacteria, glycogen or oligosaccharide accumulation involves glucose-1-phosphate partitioning into either ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc) or UDP-Glc. Their respective synthesis is catalyzed by allosterically regulated ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.27, ADP-Glc PPase) or unregulated UDP-Glc PPase (EC 2.7.7.9). In this work, we characterized the UDP-Glc PPase from Streptococcus mutans. In addition, we constructed a chimeric protein by cutting the C-terminal domain of the ADP-Glc PPase from Escherichia coli and pasting it to the entire S. mutans UDP-Glc PPase. Both proteins were fully active as UDP-Glc PPases and their kinetic parameters were measured. The chimeric enzyme had a slightly higher affinity for substrates than the native S. mutans UDP-Glc PPase, but the maximal activity was four times lower. Interestingly, the chimeric protein was sensitive to regulation by pyruvate, 3-phosphoglyceric acid and fructose-1,6-bis-phosphate, which are known to be effectors of ADP-Glc PPases from different sources. The three compounds activated the chimeric enzyme up to three-fold, and increased the affinity for substrates. This chimeric protein is the first reported UDP-Glc PPase with allosteric regulatory properties. In addition, this is a pioneer work dealing with a chimeric enzyme constructed as a hybrid of two pyrophosphorylases with different specificity toward nucleoside-diphospho-glucose and our results turn to be relevant for a deeper understanding of the evolution of allosterism in this family of enzymes.
TI  - Binding analysis of ferritin with heme using alpha-casein and biotinylated-hemin: detection of heme-binding capacity of Dpr derived from heme synthesis-deficient Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Bacterial and mammalian ferritins are known to bind heme. The use of alpha-casein and biotinylated hemin could be applicable to detection of protein-bound heme and of proteins with heme-binding capacity, respectively. Although commercial horse spleen ferritin and purified horse spleen ferritin (L:H subunit ratio=4) bound to an alpha-casein-coated plate, and this binding could be inhibited by hemin, recombinant iron-binding protein (rDpr), derived from heme-deficient Streptococcus mutans and expressed in Escherichia coli, did not bind to an alpha-casein-coated plate. Both horse spleen ferritins bound to alpha-casein-immobilized beads. Commercial horse spleen ferritin and rDpr showed direct binding to hemin-agarose beads. After preincubation of commercial horse spleen ferritin or rDpr with biotinylated hemin, they showed indirect binding to avidin-immobilized beads through biotinylated hemin. These results demonstrate that alpha-casein is useful for detection of heme-binding ferritin and that both hemin-agarose and the combination of biotinylated hemin and avidin-beads are useful for detection of the heme-binding capacity of ferritin. In addition, this study also revealed that Dpr, a decameric iron-binding protein, from heme-deficient cells binds heme.
TI  - Point Mutations in the folP Gene Partly Explain Sulfonamide Resistance of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Cotrimoxazole inhibits dhfr and dhps and reportedly selects for drug resistance in pathogens. Here, Streptococcus mutans isolates were obtained from saliva of HIV/AIDS patients taking cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in Uganda. The isolates were tested for resistance to cotrimoxazole and their folP DNA (which encodes sulfonamide-targeted enzyme dhps) cloned in pUC19. A set of recombinant plasmids carrying different point mutations in cloned folP were separately transformed into folP-deficient Escherichia coli. Using sulfonamide-containing media, we assessed the growth of folP-deficient bacteria harbouring plasmids with differing folP point mutations. Interestingly, cloned folP with three mutations (A37V, N172D, R193Q) derived from Streptococcus mutans 8 conferred substantial resistance against sulfonamide to folP-deficient bacteria. Indeed, change of any of the three residues (A37V, N172D, and R193Q) in plasmid-encoded folP diminished the bacterial resistance to sulfonamide while removal of all three mutations abolished the resistance. In contrast, plasmids carrying four other mutations (A46V, E80K, Q122H, and S146G) in folP did not similarly confer any sulfonamide resistance to folP-knockout bacteria. Nevertheless, sulfonamide resistance (MIC = 50 mu M) of folP-knockout bacteria transformed with plasmid-encoded folP was much less than the resistance (MIC = 4 mM) expressed by chromosomally-encoded folP. Therefore, folP point mutations only partially explain bacterial resistance to sulfonamide.
TI  - Isocitrate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans: biochemical properties and evaluation of a putative phosphorylation site at Ser102.
AB  - Isocitrate deyhdrogenase (IDH) is a reversible enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle that catalyzes the NAD(P)(+)-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) and the NAD(P)H/CO2-dependent reductive carboxylation of alphaKG to isocitrate. The IDH gene from Streptococcus mutans was fused with the icd gene promoter from Escherichia coli to initiate its expression in the glutamate auxotrophic strain E. coli Deltaicd::kan(r) of which the icd gene has been replaced by kanamycin resistance gene. The expression of S. mutans IDH (SmIDH) may restore the wild-type phenotype of the icd-defective strain on minimal medium without glutamate. The molecular weight of SmIDH was estimated to be 70 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting a homodimeric structure. SmIDH was divalent cation-dependent and Mn(2+) was found to be the most effective cation. The optimal pH of SmIDH was 7.8 and the maximum activity was around 45 degrees C. SmIDH was completely NAD(+) dependent and its apparent Km for NAD(+) was 137 muM. In order to evaluate the role of the putative phosphorylation site at Ser102 in catalysis, two "stably phosphorylated" mutants were constructed by converting Ser102 into Glu102 or Asp102 in SmIDH to mimick a constitutively phosphorylated state. Meanwhile, the functional roles of another four amino acids (threonine, glycine, alanine and tyrosine) containing variant size of side chains were investigated. The replacement of Asp102 or Glu102 totally inactivated the enzyme, while the S102T, S102G, S102A and S102Y mutants decreased the affinity to isocitrate and only retained 16.0%, 2.8%, 3.3% and 1.1% of the original activity, respectively. These results reveal that Ser102 plays important role in substrate binding and is required for the enzyme function. Also, Ser102 in SmIDH is a potential phosphorylation site, indicating that the ancient NAD-dependent IDHs might be the underlying origin of "phosphorylation mechanism" used by their bacterial NADP-dependent homologs.
TI  - Gene cloning and characterization of MdeA, a novel multidrug efflux pump in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Multidrug resistance, especially multidrug efflux mechanisms that extrude structurally unrelated cytotoxic compounds from the cell by multidrug transporters, is a serious problem and one of the main reasons for the failure of therapeutic treatment of infections by pathogenic microorganisms as well as of cancer cells. Streptococcus mutans is considered one of the primary causative agents of dental caries and periodontal disease, which comprise the most common oral diseases. A fragment of chromosomal DNA from S. mutans KCTC3065 was cloned using Escherichia coli KAM32 as host cells lacking major multidrug efflux pumps. Although E. coli KAM32 cells were very sensitive to many antimicrobial agents, the transformed cells harboring a recombinant plasmid became resistant to several structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline, kanamycin, rhodamin 6G, ampicillin, acriflavine, ethidium bromide, and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride. This suggested that the cloned DNA fragment carries a gene encoding a multidrug efflux pump. Among 49 of the multidrug-resistant transformants, we report the functional gene cloning and characterization of the function of one multidrug efflux pump, namely MdeA from S. mutans, which was expressed in E. coli KAM32. Judging from the structural and biochemical properties, we concluded that MdeA is the first cloned and characterized multidrug efflux pump using the proton motive force as the energy for efflux drugs.
TI  - Phenolic Content, Antioxidant Activity, Antibacterial Activity and Phytochemical  Composition of Garcinia lancifolia.
AB  - Garcinia lancifolia (Clusiaceae) is an unexplored medicinal plant used as stomachic, diuretic and its fruit is used to cure dysentery and diarrhoea. The acidic fruits are used to prepare juice, pickle and curries. The phytochemical analysis of different extracts of G. lancifolia leaf, stem and fruit revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. The high phenolic content was observed in the methanol extract of leaf followed by methanol extract of stem and dichloromethane extract of leaf. The G. lancifolia fruit juice exhibited high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus subtilis. The methanol extract of fruit pulp was also very effective against Gram-positive bacteria when compared with Gram-negative bacteria. The radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl was highest in fruit juice followed by methanol extract of leaf and stem. All extracts showed concentration-dependent increase in the antioxidant activity.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans: a new Gram-positive paradigm?
AB  - Despite the enormous contributions of the bacterial paradigms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis to basic and applied research, it is well known that no single organism can be a perfect representative of all other species. However, given that some bacteria are difficult, or virtually impossible, to cultivate in the laboratory, that some are recalcitrant to genetic and molecular manipulation, and that others can be extremely dangerous to manipulate, the use of model organisms will continue to play an important role in the development of basic research. In particular, model organisms are very useful for providing a better understanding of the biology of closely related species. Here, we discuss how the lifestyle, the availability of suitable in vitro and in vivo systems, and a thorough understanding of the genetics, biochemistry and physiology of the dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans have greatly advanced our understanding of important areas in the field of bacteriology such as interspecies biofilms, competence development and stress responses. In this article, we provide an argument that places S. mutans, an organism that evolved in close association with the human host, as a novel Gram-positive model organism.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - Characterization of a Streptococcus mutans intergenic region containing a small toxic peptide and its cis-encoded antisense small RNA antitoxin.
AB  - Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules consist of a pair of genes that encode two components: a protein toxin and an antitoxin, which may be in the form of either a labile protein or an antisense small RNA. Here we describe, to the best of our knowledge, the first functional chromosomal type I TA system in streptococci. Our model organism is the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans. Our results showed that the genome of S. mutans UA159 reference strain harbors a previously unannotated Fst-like toxin (Fst-Sm) and its cis-encoded small RNA antitoxin (srSm) converging towards the end of the toxin gene in IGR176, a small intergenic region of 318 nt. Fst-Sm is a small hydrophobic peptide of 32 amino acid residues with homology to the Fst toxin family. Transcripts of approximately 200 nt and approximately 70 nt specific to fst-Sm mRNA and srSm RNA, respectively, were detected by Northern blot analysis throughout S. mutans growth. The toxin mRNA was considerably more stable than its cognate antitoxin. The half-life of srSm RNA was determined to be approximately 30 min, while fst-Sm mRNA had a half-life of approximately 90 min. Both fst-Sm and srSm RNAs were transcribed across direct tandem repeats providing a region of complementarity for inhibition of toxin translation. Overproduction of Fst-Sm had a toxic effect on E. coli and S. mutans cells which can be neutralized by coexpression of srSm RNA. Deletion of fst-Sm/srSm locus or overexpression of Fst-Sm/srSm had no effect on S. mutans cell growth in liquid medium and no differences in the total biofilm biomass were noted. In contrast, mild-overproduction of Fst-Sm/srSm type I TA system decreases the levels of persister cells tolerant to bacterial cell wall synthesis inhibitors.
TI  - Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) complexes of tridentate asymmetrical Schiff base ligands: synthesis, characterization, properties and biological activity.
AB  - New asymmetrical tridentate Schiff base ligands were synthesized using 1,2-phenylenediamine, 4-methyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde, 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde. Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were synthesised and characterized by using FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV-Vis, XRD, ESR, elemental analysis and fluorescence studies. The antimicrobial activity of the ligands and their metal complexes were studied against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus mutans RSHM 676, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The determination of the antibacterial activity was done using the broth microdilution methods. In general, it has been determined that the studied compounds have MIC values similar to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It has been found that Ni, Pb, Zn derivatives of HL1A and ZnL(2)A has lower MIC values than ampicillin for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 strain.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of the foldase homologue PrsA in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is generally considered to be the principal etiological agent for dental caries. Many of the proteins necessary for its colonization of the oral cavity and pathogenesis are exported to the cell surface or the extracellular matrix, a process that requires the assistance of the export machineries. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the S. mutans genome contains a prsA gene, whose counterparts in other gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus and Lactococcus, encode functions involved in protein post-export. In this study, we constructed a PrsA-deficient derivative of S. mutans and demonstrated that the prsA mutant displayed an altered cell wall/membrane protein profile as well as cell-surface-related phenotypes, including auto-aggregation, increased surface hydrophobicity and abnormal biofilm formation. Further analysis revealed that the disruption of the prsA gene resulted in reduced insoluble glucan production by cell surface localized glucosyltransferases, and mutacin as well as cell surface-display of a heterologous expressed GFP fusion to the cell surface protein SpaP. Our study suggested that PrsA in S. mutans encodes functions similar to those identified in Bacillus, and so is likely to be involved in protein post-export.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial effect of three irrigant solutions (chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidinated MUMS).
AB  - AIM: To compare the antimicrobial effect of 2% chlorhexidine, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and MUMS containing 2% chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All of the above irrigants were examined on Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei and E. coli. A total of 0.5 CC of each solution and 0.5 CC of McFarland solution bacterium were added to each examination tube. After 15, 30 and 45 minutes, colony count was performed for each tube. The difference in the number of bacteria indicated the effect taken by disinfectant material. RESULTS: MUMS containing chlorhexidine showed the antimicrobial properties just like chlorhexidine's effect against E. coli, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus casei in preventing these entire microorganisms to incubate. Sodium hypochlorite was not effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans incubated in 15, 30 and 45 minutes and Enterococcus faecalis in 15 minutes. CONCLUSION: MUMS has antimicrobial properties similar to chlorhexidine. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: As MUMS containing chlorhexidine can transfer chlorhexidine through its own surfactant around apical area and it can open the dentinal tubules by its own chelator for more penetration of chlorhexidine, it may be a choice for canal irrigation.
TI  - A novel antibacterial modification treatment of titanium capable to improve osseointegration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the different causes of orthopedic and dental implant failure,  infection remains the most serious and devastating complication associated with biomaterial devices. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop an innovative osteointegrative and antibacterial biomimetic coating on titanium and to perform a chemical-physical and in vitro biological characterization of the coating using the SAOS-2 cell line. We also studied the antibacterial properties of the coating against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains. METHODS: An electrochemical solution containing silicon, calcium, phosphorous, sodium, and silver nanoparticles was used to obtain the antibacterial by Anodic Spark Deposition (ASD) treatment. Surface morphology was characterized using SEM and laser profilometry. A qualitative analysis of the chemical composition of the coating was assessed by EDS. The adhesion properties of the coating to the titanium bulk were performed with a 3-point bending test. SAOS-2 osteoblastic cell line spreading and morphology and viability were investigated. The bacterial adhesion and the antibacterial properties were investigated after 3 h and 24 h of incubation with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli bacterial strains. RESULTS: The proposed anodization treatment created a chemically and morphologically modified, adherent titanium oxide layer, characterized by a microporous morphology enriched by calcium, silicon, phosphorous, and silver. The preliminary biological characterization showed optimal SAOS-2 cell adhesion and proliferation as well as a strong antibacterial effect. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, we believe that this novel biomimetic and antibacterial treatment hold promise for enhancing osteointegration while conferring strong antibacterial properties to titanium.
TI  - Putative down-stream signaling molecule of GTPase in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a strict anaerobic bacterium mainly responsible for periodontal disease in oral cavity. Putative GTPase gene (pgp) of this bacterium was cloned and its recombinant protein (rPGP) was produced in Escherichia coli. Based on the amino acid sequence of SGP that is a GTP-binding protein of Streptococcus mutans, putative GTPase amino acid sequence was deduced in the data base of genome sequences of Porphyromonas gingivalis. A 900-bp PCR fragment was amplified with P. gingivalis genomic DNA as a template and cloned into E. coli JM 109. Then pgp was transferred into pQE-30 expression vector to make pQE-PGP for production of rPGR. This protein was produced and purified by Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography. Anti-PGP antibody was also produced in Sprague Dawley rats. Using Westernblot analysis with this antibody, it was confirmed that the rPGP produced in E. coli was identical to that of donor strain. Furthermore, by Southernblot analysis it was revealed that the pgp was originated from P. gingivalis. By immunoprecipitation with anti-PGP antibody and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis it was found that PGP was able to bind to acetate kinase, which was reported to be a secondary signaling-molecule in anaerobic microorganisms. Therefore, these results imply that P. gingivalis produces putative GTPase and this protein might play a potential role in signaling pathway in oral biofilm formation.
TI  - Gene cloning, expression, and characterization of mutanase from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus MP-1.
AB  - Mutanases hydrolyze d-glucosidic linkages of alpha-1,3-linked polysaccharides which are important components of dental plaque. Therefore, these enzymes can be useful in preventive oral hygiene. A gene encoding mutanase was cloned from soil-isolated Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus MP-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting recombinant enzyme was characterized. The nucleotide sequence of the mutanase gene consisted of 3786 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1261 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 131.62kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a high degree of similarity with mutanases of Paenibacillus sp. KSM-M126 and Paenibacillus humicus NA1123, with 84% and 80% identity, respectively. The recombinant enzyme was purified 17.5-fold to homogeneity with a recovery of 37%. The purified mutanase showed optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 45 degrees C, and was completely stable at pH 4.0-9.5 and up to 45 degrees C. The enzyme was specific for alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages and effectively solubilized fungal alpha-1,3-glucans and streptococcal mutans, releasing nigerooligosaccharides. The mutanase did not hydrolyze a synthetic substrate readily hydrolyzed by exoglucanases and the enzyme activity was not suppressed in the presence of deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of exo-type enzymes. These results suggest an endohydrolytic mode of action.
TI  - Synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. In this study, the combination effects between nano-Ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. The MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects. The results showed that nano-Ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic activities. The antibiofilm activities of nano-Ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. Formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. The results indicated that nano-Ags also had antibiofilm activities. To understand these effects of nano-Ags, an ATPase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. The antibacterial activity of nano-Ags was influenced by ATP-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. Additionally, nano-Ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. It was concluded that nano-Ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.
TI  - Assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome DNA probes from human bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome DNA probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals' oral biofilm. DESIGN: Twenty four mature Wistar rats were equally divided in two groups. One group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. The alcohol-treated group (AT) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. Upon euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. Bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the DNA checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. Signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test with a significance level <0.05. RESULTS: Cross-reaction for all targeted species, except Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the AT group. Significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the AT group (p=0.001). The percentage of E. coli-like species was highest in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-genome DNA probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. Alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.
TI  - Flagellin-PAc fusion protein is a high-efficacy anti-caries mucosal vaccine.
AB  - We previously demonstrated that an anti-caries DNA vaccine intranasally administered with recombinant flagellin protein as a mucosal adjuvant enhanced salivary IgA response and conferred better protection against caries. However, the relatively weak immunogenicity of DNA vaccines and the necessity for a large quantity of antigens remain significant challenges. Here, we fused the flagellin derived from E. coli (KF) and target antigen PAc containing the A-P fragment of PAc from S. mutans (rPAc) to produce a single recombinant protein (KF-rPAc). The abilities of KF-rPAc to induce rPAc-specific mucosal and systemic responses and protective efficiency against caries following intranasal immunization were compared with those of rPAc alone or a mixture of rPAc and KF (KF + rPAc) in rats. Results showed that KF-rPAc promoted significantly higher rPAc-specific antibodies in serum as well as in saliva than did an equivalent dose of rPAc alone or a mixture of KF + rPAc. Intranasal immunization of 8.5 microg KF-rPAc could achieve 64.2% reduction of dental caries in rats. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that flagellin and PAc fusion strategy is promising for anti-caries vaccine development, and KF-rPAc could be used as an anti-caries mucosal vaccine.
TI  - [Construction of a red fluorescent shuttle vector controlled by recA operon promoter of Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a red fluorescent shuttle vector controlled by recA operon promoter to transform Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: The promoter of recA was amplified from Streptococcus mutans UA159, and connected to plasmid pDsRed2-N1 to construct pRred with a red fluorescent coding gene, which was then inserted into the shuttle vector pDL276 to construct pLRred. RESULTS: pLRred was successfully constructed, and Escherichia coli transformed with the pLRred plasmid could express reporter gene DsRed. CONCLUSIONS: The recombination plasmid pLRred can be used in the further research of the expression of cariogenic virulence factor gene by Streptococcus mutans in biofilm.
TI  - Structure of the branched-chain aminotransferase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The branched-chain amino-acid aminotransferase from Streptococcus mutans (SmIlvE) was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli with high yield. An effective purification protocol was established. A bioactivity assay indicated that SmIlvE had aminotransferase activity. The specific activity of SmIlvE towards amino-acid substrates was found to be as follows (in descending order): Ile > Leu > Val > Trp > Gly. The protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method with PEG 3350 as the primary precipitant. The structure of SmIlvE was solved at 1.97 A resolution by the molecular-replacement method. Comparison with structures of homologous proteins enabled the identification of conserved structural elements that might play a role in substrate binding. Further work is needed to confirm the interaction between SmIlvE and its substrates by determining the structures of their complexes.
TI  - An agar diffusion study comparing the antimicrobial activity of Nanoseal with some other endodontic sealers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new experimental nano-hydroxyapatite epoxy resin-based sealer (Nanoseal) with several other commercially available sealers; AH26, Tubliseal, Sealapex and Roekoseal against Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Escherichia coli for up to 7 days. Agar diffusion was used in this study. Fifty Muller-Hinton agar plates were prepared and divided into five experimental groups (n = 10), for each micro-organism. Another 10 agar plates were used as positive and negative controls. Endodontic sealers were tested against each micro-organism. Inhibition zones produced were recorded. The results of this study showed that all test materials exhibited inhibition zones towards the tested micro-organisms for 7 days except for Roekoseal, which showed no inhibition zones. Nanoseal and AH26 exhibited similar zones of inhibition. Significant difference was found between Nanoseal and the other tested sealers (P < 0.001).
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the Basque Country (Northern Spain).
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (EEP/PEP), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. It was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. Results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC from 17 to 26 mg/ml). To our knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria [Salmonella enterica (MIC from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)] and lesser activity against Helicobacter pylori (MIC from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while Escherichia coli was resistant. This concluded that the Basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested, while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences (P </= 0.05) between EEP and PEP extracts.
TI  - [Optimizing expression and antibody preparation of recombinant Streptococcus mutans surface protein].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The soluble protein recombinant Streptococcus mutans surface protein (rPAc) was expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli) after the optimization of inducing conditions. The antiserum against rPAc was obtained by immunizing mice with the purified rPAc. METHODS: The soluble expression of rPAc in E. coli was further optimized by means of different culture conditions. Polyclonal antibody was made by immunizing mice with purified rPAc. Western blot and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were carried out to identify the immunocompetence of the antibody. RESULTS: The highest soluble expression level of rPAc was obtained at Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (pH=7.2) when optical density (OD600nm) was 0.6 after being induced at 30 degrees C for 4 h and the concentration of isopropyl beta-D-1-thigalactopyranoside (IPTG) was 1.0mmol x L(-1). The titer of the mice antiserum against rPAc was about 1:6000 by ELISA analysis, and rPAc could be specifically recognized by Western blot analysis. CONCLUSION: This study proved that rPAc can be effectively expressed as a soluble form in E. coli, and the high specific polyclonal antibody of rPAc was proved to be prepared, which shed light on further research of DNA prime-protein boost inoculation.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excel essential oil.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excel (family Euphorbiaceae) stem bark is used in Cameroon by Baka pygmies as a remedy for wound healing and tetanus. AIM OF THE STUDY: To characterize the chemical composition and to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the essential oil of the plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil was extracted from the stem bark by dynamic head space and by hydrodistillation and characterized by GC and GC-MS analyses. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal-fungicidal concentration (MBC-MFC) by the micro and macrodilution methods. The following bacteria and fungi were used: Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 3584, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida albicans LM 450, Trichophyton mentagrophytes LM 230, Trichophyton rubrum LM 237, Microsporum canis LM 324. RESULTS: The hydrodistillation afforded 0.06% (dry weight basis) of pale yellow oil. Thirty-eight compounds representing 90.69% were identified. The major component (36.40%) was found to be (E)-isoelemicin, identified by comparison of its (1)H-NMR experimental data, with literature data. The oil showed good antibacterial activity against Clostridium Sporogenes, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pyogenes with MIC ranging from 13.5 to 126 mug/ml. A weak antifungal activity (MIC 250 mug/ml) was found against Trichophyton rubrum, only. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial activity and the chemical composition of Phyllanthus muellerianus stem bark essential oil are reported for the first time.
TI  - Pyrazine functionalized Ag(I) and Au(I)-NHC complexes are potential antibacterial agents.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is an ever-increasing problem throughout the world and has already reached severe proportions. Bacteria can develop ways to render traditional antibiotics ineffective, raising a crucial need to find new antimicrobials with novel mode of action. We demonstrate here a novel class of pyrazine functionalized Ag(I) and Au(I)-NHC complexes as antibacterial agents against human pathogens that are resistant to several antibiotics. Complete synthetic and structural studies of Au(I) and Ag(I) complexes of 2-(1-methylimidazolium) pyrimidinechloride (L-1), 2,6-bis(1-methylimidazol)pyrazinechloride (L-2) and 2,6-bis(1-methyl imidazol) pyrazinehexa-fluorophosphate (L-3) are reported herein. Chloro[2,6-bis(1-methyl imidazol)pyrazine]gold(I), 2b and chloro [2,6-bis(1-methyl imidazol)pyrazine]silver(I), 2a complexes are found to have more potent antimicrobial activity than other synthesized compounds and several conventionally used antibiotics. Complexes 2b and 2a also inhibit the biofilm formation by Gram-positive bacteria, Streptococcus mutans and Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, causing drastic damage to the bacterial cell wall and increasing membrane permeability. Complexes 2b and 2a strongly binds to both Lys and Dap-Type peptidoglycan layers, which may be the reason for damage to the bacterial cell wall. Theoretical studies of all the complexes reveal that 2b and 2a are more reactive than other complexes, and this may be the cause of differences in antibacterial activity. These findings will pave the way towards developing a new class of antibiotics against different groups of conventional antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Disinfection effect of dental impression tray adhesives.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Iatrogenic infections are serious problems in dental offices. Impression tray adhesives are delivered in glass containers with a fixed brush attached inside the cap. Using the brush for application of the impression tray adhesive on a contaminated impression tray or prostheses, pathogen transmission by replacing the cap with the brush is possible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains (patient strains and in vitro strains) were supervaccinated on Columbia agar. The bacterial solution was diluted with TSB and aerobically grown, and starting concentration was 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The stock solution was placed on Columbia agar. Alginate, polyether, and silicon impression tray adhesives were applied to the center of the particular blood agar plates and incubated for 48 h. The expansion of the inhibition zone assays were measured using a microscope. RESULTS: Twenty-one different bacterial strains were selected in the saliva samples of 20 patients. The growth inhibition for alginate impression tray adhesive was 1.1 % (+/-0.3) of the patient strains. The overgrowth of polyether impression tray adhesive was 30.6 % (+/-9.3) and for silicon impression tray adhesive 11.8 % (+/-5.0). In in vitro strains, alginate impression tray adhesive performed an inhibition of 0.7 % (+/-0.3). The overgrowth of polyether impression tray adhesive was 7.0 % (+/-1.6) and for silicon impression tray adhesive was 6.5 % (+/-1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Using the fixed brush for application of the impression tray adhesive on multiple patients, a cross-contamination cannot be ruled out. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An application of the impression tray adhesive with a pipette and a single-use brush would eliminate the contamination.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabK) from Streptococcus mutans strain UA159.
AB  - A triclosan-resistant flavoprotein termed FabK is the sole enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans. In this study, FabK from S. mutans strain UA159 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. Diffraction data were collected to 2.40 A resolution using a synchrotron-radiation source. The crystal belonged to space group P6(2), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 105.79, c = 44.15 A. The asymmetric unit contained one molecule, with a corresponding V(M) of 2.05 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 39.9%.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by Solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  - Xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of Candida albicans. The aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for Candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. Water extract from the herbaceous plant Solidago virgaurea (Goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). Saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in S. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and S. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. C. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans (four strains), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius or Enterococcus faecalis. When inocula were incubated with Solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in Candida yeast-hyphal transition. Candida biofilms were then prepared in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. In conclusion, the S. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of C. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Structure of the bifunctional methyltransferase YcbY (RlmKL) that adds the m7G2069 and m2G2445 modifications in Escherichia coli 23S rRNA.
AB  - The 23S rRNA nucleotide m(2)G2445 is highly conserved in bacteria, and in Escherichia coli this modification is added by the enzyme YcbY. With lengths of around 700 amino acids, YcbY orthologs are the largest rRNA methyltransferases identified in Gram-negative bacteria, and they appear to be fusions from two separate proteins found in Gram-positives. The crystal structures described here show that both the N- and C-terminal halves of E. coli YcbY have a methyltransferase active site and their folding patterns respectively resemble the Streptococcus mutans proteins Smu472 and Smu776. Mass spectrometric analyses of 23S rRNAs showed that the N-terminal region of YcbY and Smu472 are functionally equivalent and add the m(2)G2445 modification, while the C-terminal region of YcbY is responsible for the m(7)G2069 methylation on the opposite side of the same helix (H74). Smu776 does not target G2069, and this nucleotide remains unmodified in Gram-positive rRNAs. The E.coli YcbY enzyme is the first example of a methyltransferase catalyzing two mechanistically different types of RNA modification, and has been renamed as the Ribosomal large subunit methyltransferase, RlmKL. Our structural and functional data provide insights into how this bifunctional enzyme evolved.
TI  - CovR alleviates transcriptional silencing by a nucleoid-associated histone-like protein in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - In Streptococcus mutans, the global response regulator CovR plays an important role in biofilm formation, stress tolerance response, and caries production. We have previously demonstrated that CovR activates a large gene cluster, which is a part of a genomic island, TnSmu2. In this article, we have further characterized CovR at the molecular level to understand the gene activation mechanism. Toward this end, we mapped the transcription start site of the operon that lies upstream of the SMU.1348 gene (P(SMU.1348)), the first gene of the cluster. We constructed a transcriptional reporter fusion and showed that CovR induces expression from P(SMU.1348). We also demonstrated that purified CovR protects the sequence surrounding the -10 region of P(SMU.1348). In an in vitro transcription assay, we showed that histone-like protein (HLP), a homologue of Escherichia coli HU protein, represses transcription from P(SMU.1348). In vivo overexpression of HLP in trans also represses transcription from P(SMU.1348). Addition of CovR to the HLP-repressed P(SMU.1348) resulted in increased transcription from the promoter, suggesting a role for CovR in countering HLP silencing. Moreover, addition of SMU.1349, a transcriptional activator of the operon, to the in vitro assay further stimulated the transcription. Based on our in vivo and in vitro results, we propose a model for transcriptional activation of the operon.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of S-ribosylhomocysteinase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - S-Ribosylhomocysteinase (LuxS) encoded by the luxS gene from Streptococcus mutans plays a crucial role in the quorum-sensing system. LuxS was solubly expressed in Escherichia coli with high yield. The purity of the purified target protein, which was identified by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS analysis, was >95%. The protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method with PEG 3350 as the primary precipitant. X-ray diffraction data were collected at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). Diffraction by the crystal extended to 2.4 A resolution and the crystal belonged to space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 55.3, b = 148.7, c = 82.8 A.
TI  - Overexpression, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of the RNA polymerase domain of primase from Streptococcus mutans strain UA159.
AB  - Primase is the enzyme that synthesizes RNA primers on single-stranded DNA during  normal DNA replication. In this study, the catalytic core domain of primase from Streptococcus mutans UA159 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized. Diffraction data were collected to 1.60 A resolution using a synchrotron-radiation source. The crystal belonged to space group P4(1) or P4(3), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 52.63, c = 110.31 A. The asymmetric unit is likely to contain one molecule, with a corresponding V(M) of 1.77 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 30.7%.
TI  - Prokaryotic diacylglycerol kinase and undecaprenol kinase.
AB  - Prokaryotic diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) and undecaprenol kinase (UDPK) are the lone members of a family of multispan membrane enzymes that are very small, lack relationships to any other family of proteins-including water soluble kinases-and exhibit an unusual structure and active site architecture. Escherichia coli DAGK plays an important role in recycling diacylglycerol produced as a by-product of biosynthesis of molecules located in the periplasmic space. UDPK seems to play an analogous role in gram-positive bacteria, where its importance is evident because UDPK is essential for biofilm formation by the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans. DAGK has also long served as a model system for studies of membrane protein biocatalysis, folding, stability, and structure. This review explores our current understanding of the microbial physiology, enzymology, structural biology, and folding of the prokaryotic DAGK family, which is based on over 40 years of studies.
TI  - Characterization of NrnA homologs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycoplasma  pneumoniae.
AB  - Processive RNases are unable to degrade efficiently very short oligonucleotides,  and they are complemented by specific enzymes, nanoRNases, that assist in this process. We previously identified NrnA (YtqI) from Bacillus subtilis as a bifunctional protein with the ability to degrade nanoRNA (RNA oligos </=5 nucleotides) and to dephosphorylate 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (pAp) to AMP. While the former activity is analogous to that of oligoribonuclease (Orn) from Escherichia coli, the latter corresponds to CysQ. NrnA homologs are widely present in bacterial and archaeal genomes. They are found preferably in genomes that lack Orn or CysQ homologs. Here, we characterize NrnA homologs from important human pathogens, Mpn140 from Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Rv2837c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Like NrnA, these enzymes degrade nanoRNA and dephosphorylate pAp in vitro. However, they show dissimilar preferences for specific nanoRNA substrate lengths. Whereas NrnA prefers RNA 3-mers with a 10-fold higher specific activity compared to 5-mers, Rv2837c shows a preference for nanoRNA of a different length, namely, 2-mers. Mpn140 degrades Cy5-labeled nanoRNA substrates in vitro with activities varying within one order of magnitude as follows: 5-mer>4-mer>3-mer>2-mer. In agreement with these in vitro activities, both Rv2837c and Mpn140 can complement the lack of their functional counterparts in E. coli: CysQ and Orn. The NrnA homolog from Streptococcus mutans, SMU.1297, was previously shown to hydrolyze pAp and to complement an E. coli cysQ mutant. Here, we show that SMU.1297 can complement an E. coli orn(-) mutant, suggesting that having both pAp-phosphatase and nanoRNase activity is a common feature of NrnA homologs.
TI  - AFM study of the differential inhibitory effects of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a main constituent of tea catechins, affects Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria differently; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to compare morphological alterations in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria induced by EGCG and by H(2)O(2) at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). EGCG initially induced aggregates in the cell envelopes of Staphylococcus aureus and eventually caused cell lysis, which was not observed in cells treated with H(2)O(2). It initially induced nanoscale perforations or microscale grooves in the cell envelopes of Escherichia coli O157:H7 which eventually disappeared, similar to E. coli cells treated with H(2)O(2). An E. coli O157:H7 tpx mutant, with a defect in thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase (Tpx), was more severely damaged by EGCG when compared with its wild type. Similar differing effects were observed in other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when exposed to EGCG; it caused aggregated in Streptococcus mutans, while it caused grooves in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AFM results suggest that the major morphological changes of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls induced by EGCG depend on H(2)O(2) release. This is not the case for Gram-positive bacteria. Oxidative stress in Gram-negative bacteria induced by EGCG was confirmed by flow cytometry.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of different toothpastes and mouthrinses: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-microbial agents have been used as a chemotherapeutic agent to improve oral health. This in vitro study was carried out to determine antimicrobial efficacy of different toothpastes and mouthrinses against the oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of five toothpastes and five mouthrinses were tested for their antimicrobial activity against three oral pathogens namely, Streptococcus mutans (MTCC 890), Escherichia coli (MTCC 579) and Candida albicans (MTCC 854) by well agar diffusion assay. Statistical Analysis was performed using a statistical package, SPSS windows version 15, by applying mean values using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc least square differences (LSD) method(alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Toothpaste formulation A showed maximum zones of inhibition against the test organism, Escherichia coli (P<60;0.001) compared to all other toothpastes formulations. Against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, the zones of inhibition were less in comparison to E.coli but were significantly different at higher dilutions (1:8, 1:16 P<60;0.05) for toothpaste formulation A. Mouthrinses formulation H showed maximum efficacy against the test organism, Escherichia coli (P<60;0.001) compared to all other mouthrinse formulations. Against Streptococcus mutans, mouthrinses formulations F, G and J showed significant antimicrobial activity (P<60;0.05) compared to formulation H and I. CONCLUSION: In the present study, it has been demonstrated that triclosan containing toothpastes formulations are more effective in control of oral microflora compared to non-triclosan containing synthetic toothpastes. Among mouthrinses formulations, chlorhexidine was found to be more effective than or as effective as triclosan against the organisms tested.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Regulation of transcription by SMU.1349, a TetR family regulator, in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The TetR family of transcriptional regulators is ubiquitous in bacteria, where it plays an important role in bacterial gene expression. Streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive pathogen considered to be the primary etiological agent in the formation of dental caries, encodes at least 18 TetR regulators. Here we characterized one such TetR regulator, SMU.1349, encoded by the TnSmu2 operon, which appeared to be acquired by the organism via horizontal gene transfer. SMU.1349 is transcribed divergently from the rest of the genes encoded by the operon. By the use of a transcriptional reporter system and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that SMU.1349 activates the transcription of several genes that are encoded within the TnSmu2 operon. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays with purified SMU.1349 protein demonstrated binding to the intergenic region between SMU.1349 and the TnSmu2 operon; therefore, SMU.1349 is directly involved in gene transcription. Using purified S. mutans RpoD and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, we also demonstrated in an in vitro transcription assay that SMU.1349 could activate transcription from the TnSmu2 operon promoter. Furthermore, we showed that SMU.1349 could also repress transcription from its own promoter by binding to the intergenic region, suggesting that SMU.1349 acts as both an activator and a repressor. Thus, unlike most of the TetR family proteins, which generally function as transcriptional repressors, SMU.1349 is unique in that it can function as both.
TI  - Cloning-independent and counterselectable markerless mutagenesis system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Insertion duplication mutagenesis and allelic replacement mutagenesis are among the most commonly utilized approaches for targeted mutagenesis in bacteria. However, both techniques are limited by a variety of factors that can complicate mutant phenotypic studies. To circumvent these limitations, multiple markerless mutagenesis techniques have been developed that utilize either temperature-sensitive plasmids or counterselectable suicide vectors containing both positive- and negative-selection markers. For many species, these techniques are not especially useful due to difficulties of cloning with Escherichia coli and/or a lack of functional negative-selection markers. In this study, we describe the development of a novel approach for the creation of markerless mutations. This system employs a cloning-independent methodology and should be easily adaptable to a wide array of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. The entire process of creating both the counterselection cassette and mutation constructs can be completed using overlapping PCR protocols, which allows extremely quick assembly and eliminates the requirement for either temperature-sensitive replicons or suicide vectors. As a proof of principle, we used Streptococcus mutans reference strain UA159 to create markerless in-frame deletions of 3 separate bacteriocin genes as well as triple mutants containing all 3 deletions. Using a panel of 5 separate wild-type S. mutans strains, we further demonstrated that the procedure is nearly 100% efficient at generating clones with the desired markerless mutation, which is a considerable improvement in yield compared to existing approaches.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antifungal effects of tissue conditioners containing a photocatalyst.
AB  - This study examined the antimicrobial/antifungal ability of a tissue conditioner  containing a photocatalyst for Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The photocatalyst was mixed with tissue conditioners powders at concentrations of 0, 10, 15, and 20 wt%. Tissue conditioners powders containing a photocatalyst were mixed with liquid to make test specimens. Test specimens inoculated by each microorganism were irradiated by ultraviolet light for 0-, 2- and 4 hours. The antimicrobial/antifungal effects were evaluated by the CFU technique. The CFU values of each microorganism for tissue conditioners containing a photocatalyst showed significant decrease following UV-irradiation. The improvement in antimicrobial/antifungal effects was concomitant with the increase of the mixing ratio and the irradiation time. Therefore, the results indicated that tissue conditioners containing a photocatalyst might have photocatalytic ability.
TI  - A new biphenyl and antimicrobial activity of extracts and compounds from Clusia burlemarxii.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation on Clusia burlemarxii (Clusiaceae) led to isolation and identification of nine compounds. Were isolated from leaves 3-O-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosylquercetin, 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosylkaempferol, 4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethyldihydrofuran-2-one, 2Z-delta-tocotrienoloic acid and friedelin and were isolated from trunk betulinic acid, protocatechuic acid, lyoniresinol, and a new biphenyl 2,2-dimethyl-3,5-dihydroxy-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromane. The structures were determined by (1)H, (1)(3)C-NMR, DEPT, HMBC, HMQC, HRESIMS. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger and Cladosporium cladosporioides was also determined. Extracts and compounds showed significant activity against tested Gram-positive bacteria, none activity against tested Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). Following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for HA, we investigated its effects on 15 ATCC strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. The in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. The results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by HA. In particular, staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus mutans, two Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida glabrata and C. parapsilosis displayed a HA dose-dependent growth inhibition; no HA effects were detected in E. coli ATCC 13768 and C. albicans; S. sanguinis was favoured by the highest HA dose. Therefore, the influence of HA on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-bacterial activity of some heterocyclic chalcone derivatives bearing thiofuran, furan, and quinoline moieties.
AB  - 36 Novel heterocyclic chalcone derivatives were synthesized and tested for their  anti-bacterial activity. Some compounds presented good anti-microbial activities against Gram-positive bacteria (including the multidrug-resistant clinical isolates). This class of compounds presented high potency against Streptococcus mutans, among which the derivatives F2 with an MIC of 2 microg/mL was as active as the standard drug (norfloxacin) and less active than oxacillin. All the compounds did not inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli CCARM 1924 or Escherichia coli CCARM 1356) at 64 microg/mL.
TI  - Development of a monoclonal antibody against glucosyltransferase D of Streptococcus mutans GS 5.
AB  - Glucosyltransferases GtfB, GtfC, and GtfD of Streptococcus mutans are virulent factors involved in dental caries. Consequently, they are considered to be target molecules in the development of vaccines against dental caries. Among them, GtfD plays a significant role in the sucrose-dependent cellular adhesion of S. mutans, and a number of studies have suggested that the N-terminus of GtfD is an important part of its role in enzymatic activity. In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of GtfD (anti-GtfDN antibody) in an initial attempt to investigate its preventive efficacy against dental caries. To obtain anti-GtfDN monoclonal antibodies, the gene for the N-terminus of gtfD (2 kb) was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector, pQE30; then the expressed protein (about 75 kDa) was purified. The purified GtfDN protein was injected into BALB/c mice, and hybridoma clones were established. We obtained three hybridoma clones (HDN9, HDN11, and HDN28) capable of producing anti-GtfDN antibodies. Their binding specificity was characterized by ELISA, dot blot, and Western blot analysis after purification using affinity column chromatography. The isotype of the monoclonal antibodies was confirmed to be IgG2a.
TI  - Effects of DNA methylation on expression of virulence genes in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Bacteria produce a variety of enzymes capable of methylating DNA. In many species, the majority of adenine methylation is accomplished by the DNA adenine methylase Dam. In Escherichia coli the Dam methylase plays roles in the initiation of replication, mismatch repair, and gene regulation. In a number of other bacterial species, mutation or overexpression of Dam leads to attenuation of virulence. Homologues of the dam gene exist in some members of the Firmicutes, including Streptococcus mutans, a dental pathogen. An S. mutans strain inactivated in the dam gene (SMU.504; here designated damA) was engineered, and phenotypes linked to cariogenicity were examined. A prominent observation was that the damA mutant produced greater amounts of glucan than the parental strain. Real-time PCR confirmed upregulation of gtfB. To determine whether other loci were affected by the damA mutation, a microarray analysis was carried out. Seventy genes were upregulated at least 2-fold in the damA mutant, and 33 genes were downregulated at least 2-fold. In addition to gtfB (upregulated 2.6-fold; 1.7-fold when measured by real-time PCR), other upregulated virulence factors included gbpC (upregulated 2.1-fold) and loci predicted to encode bacteriocins (upregulated 2- to 7-fold). Various sugar transport operons were also upregulated, the most extreme being the cellobiose operon (upregulated nearly 40-fold). Expression of sacB, encoding fructosyltransferase, was downregulated 2.4-fold. The sequence 5'-GATC-3' appeared to constitute the recognition sequence for methylation. These results provide evidence that DNA methylation in S. mutans has a global effect on gene expression, including that of genes associated with cariogenic potential.
TI  - Crystal structures of cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE) from Streptococcus mutans: a dynamic zinc-inversion model.
AB  - Cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE) catalyzes the direct transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to l-homocysteine to form methionine. Previous studies have shown that the MetE active site coordinates a zinc atom, which is thought to act as a Lewis acid and plays a role in the activation of thiol. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies and mutagenesis experiments identified the zinc-binding site in MetE from Escherichia coli. Further structural investigations of MetE from Thermotoga maritima lead to the proposition of two models: "induced fit" and "dynamic equilibrium", to account for the catalytic mechanisms of MetE. Here, we present crystal structures of oxidized and zinc-replete MetE from Streptococcus mutans at the physiological pH. The structures reveal that zinc is mobile in the active center and has the possibility to invert even in the absence of homocysteine. These structures provide evidence for the dynamic equilibrium model.
TI  - Calcium ion-dependent increase in thermostability of dextran glucosidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Dextran glucosidase from Streptococcus mutans (SmDG), which belongs to glycoside  hydrolase family 13 (GH13), hydrolyzes the non-reducing terminal glucosidic linkage of isomaltooligosaccharides and dextran. Thermal deactivation of SmDG did not follow the single exponential decay but rather the two-step irreversible deactivation model, which involves an active intermediate having 39% specific activity. The presence of a low concentration of CaCl2 increased the thermostability of SmDG, mainly due to a marked reduction in the rate constant of deactivation of the intermediate. The addition of MgCl2 also enhanced thermostability, while KCl and NaCl were not effective. Therefore, divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, were considered to stabilize SmDG. On the other hand, CaCl2 had no significant effect on catalytic reaction. The enhanced stability by Ca2+ was probably related to calcium binding in the beta-->alpha loop 1 of the (beta/alpha)(8) barrel of SmDG. Because similar structures and sequences are widespread in GH13, these GH13 enzymes might have been stabilized by calcium ions.
TI  - [Analysis of the inhibitory capacity against bacterial growth of several materials of dental use. Preliminar].
AB  - Dental plaque is one of the reasons for odontogenic infection. Although multiple  bacteria are involved in these processes, A.actinomycetemcomitans and S.mutans are considered directly responsible for localized aggressive periodontitis and caries respectively. On the other hand, it seems clear that the oral flora utilizes especially not well polished surfaces or without bacteriastatic capacity in order to obtain better adhesion. Based on those facts we expect to prove the inhibitory capacity "in vitro" of some materials used for teeth restoration and for the cementation of accessories against one common bacterium in the human flora and two pathogenic bacteria of the oral cavity. We prepared, following the manufacturer's instructions, 18 discs for each one of the materials used in the study (2 composites and 2 ionomeros of glass). 6 discs of each material are incubated with A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. mutans and E. coli. 3 of them are incubated directly on the discs and the other 3 are incubated previously in an artificial saliva for 24 days. From the results, should be highlighted that only one of the materials demonstrated inhibitory capacity against A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. coli. None of them demonstrated inhibitory capacity against S. mutans.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of argininosuccinate lyase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is an important enzyme in arginine synthesis and the urea cycle, which are highly conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes. The gene encoding Streptococcus mutans ASL (smASL) was amplified and cloned into expression vector pET28a. The recombinant smASL protein was expressed in a soluble form in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified to homogeneity by two-step column chromatography. Crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained and X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.5 A. The crystals belonged to space group R3, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 254.5, c = 78.3 A.
TI  - Characterization of antigen-presenting cells induced by intragastric immunization with recombinant chimeric immunogens constructed from Streptococcus mutans AgI/II and type I or type II heat-labile enterotoxins.
AB  - Intragastric (i.g.) immunization with recombinant chimeric proteins constructed from the saliva-binding region (SBR) of Streptococcus mutans surface antigen AgI/II and the A2/B subunits of enterobacterial heat-labile enterotoxins has been successfully used to induce salivary and circulating antibodies against S. mutans that have protective potential against dental caries. To investigate the mode of action of these vaccine constructs, mice were immunized i.g. with chimeric proteins constructed from SBR and cholera toxin (CT) or the type II enterotoxins of Escherichia coli, LT-IIa and LT-IIb. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) in Peyer's patches (PP) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were characterized by flow cytometry. Compared with immunization with SBR alone, chimeric proteins SBR-LTIIaA2/B and SBR-LTIIbA2/B increased the number of B cells and macrophages in PP and diminished B cell numbers in MLN, whereas SBR-CTA2/B diminished the numbers of B cells and macrophages in PP and MLN. Immunization with all three chimeric proteins led to upregulation of MHC class II molecules and co-stimulatory receptors CD40, CD80, and CD86 especially on dendritic cells in PP and also on APC in MLN. The results provide a molecular basis for the enhanced immune responses induced by chimeric proteins compared with uncoupled antigen, and for differential responses to chimeric proteins based on CT or type II enterotoxins.
TI  - Assessment of microbial contamination of toothbrush head: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common oral hygiene aid used to improve the oral health of an individual is toothbrush and it is often neglected to maintain in a proper aseptic condition, which could probably result in contamination by various micro-organisms. AIMS: 1) To assess the microbial contamination of the hard deposit on the toothbrush head, between the bristle tufts, after 1 and 3 months of use. 2) To assess the microbial contamination of the hard deposit on the toothbrush head, between the bristle tufts, which were kept in the bathrooms with and without attached toilet. SETTING AND DESIGN: An in vitro study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty toothbrushes kept in the bathrooms with an attached toilet and 20 toothbrushes kept in the bathrooms without an attached toilet were collected from the participants, making it a total of 40. Among these 20 toothbrushes in each group, 10 were used for 1 month duration and 10 were used for 3 months duration. RESULTS: Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, Klebsiella, Candida species were isolated in 1 month and 3 months used toothbrushes kept in the bathrooms without attached toilet. Escherichia coli was found in 3 months used toothbrushes kept in the bathrooms with attached toilet. Micro-organisms were found in isolated form in toothbrushes used for 1 month, whereas in toothbrushes used for 3 months they are found in clumps. CONCLUSION: Hard deposit on the toothbrush head between bristle tufts is a nidus for growth of micro-organisms, which not only affects the oral health but also affects the general health of an individual.
TI  - Truncation of N- and C-terminal regions of Streptococcus mutans dextranase enhances catalytic activity.
AB  - Multiple forms of native and recombinant endo-dextranases (Dexs) of the glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 66 exist. The GH 66 Dex gene from Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 (SmDex) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant full-size (95.4 kDa) SmDex protein was digested to form an 89.8 kDa isoform (SmDex90). The purified SmDex90 was proteolytically degraded to more than seven polypeptides (23-70 kDa) during long storage. The protease-insensitive protein was desirable for the biochemical analysis and utilization of SmDex. GH 66 Dex was predicted to comprise four regions from the N- to C-termini: N-terminal variable region (N-VR), conserved region (CR), glucan-binding site (GBS), and C-terminal variable region (C-VR). Five truncated SmDexs were generated by deleting N-VR, GBS, and/or C-VR. Two truncation-mutant enzymes devoid of C-VR (TM-NCGDelta) or N-VR/C-VR (TM-DeltaCGDelta) were catalytically active, thereby indicating that N-VR and C-VR were not essential for the catalytic activity. TM-DeltaCGDelta did not accept any further protease-degradation during long storage. TM-NCGDelta and TM-DeltaCGDelta enhanced substrate hydrolysis, suggesting that N-VR and C-VR induce hindered substrate binding to the active site.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of stem bark extracts from Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excell.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The plants of the genus Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae) are widely distributed in most tropical and subtropical countries, and have long been used in folk medicine to treat several diseases. Particularly, Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excell, commonly called "mbolongo" in Cameroon, is used by pygmies baka as a remedy for tetanus and wound infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the antimicrobial properties of Phyllanthus muellerianus (Kuntze) Excell (family Euphorbiaceae) stem bark used in Cameroon by baka pygmies as a remedy for wound healing and tetanus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and methanol extracts with and without defatting treatment, were prepared and their activity against Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 3584, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal-fungicidal concentration (MBC-MFC) by the macrodilution method. RESULTS: Water extract showed a weak activity against Clostridium sporogenes (MIC 900 mug/mL) and resulted inactive at the tested concentrations against all the other microorganisms. The defatted methanol extract, inactive against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, exhibited a very interesting activity against Clostridium sporogenes and Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC 100 mug/mL and 300 mug/mL, respectively), which seems to validate the use of this plant in pygmies traditional medicine for the treatment of tetanus and wound infections. The activity found against Streptococcus mutans (300 mug/mL), aetiological agent of caries, may suggest a possible use of this plant as natural remedy to prevent dental diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The activity against streptococci and Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 3584, showed by stem bark extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus, traditionally used by baka pygmies to treat wound infections and tetanus, is reported for the first time.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans GlnK protein: an unusual PII family member.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive bacterium present in the oral cavity, and is considered to be one of the leading causes of dental caries. S. mutans has a glnK gene, which codes for a PII-like protein that is possibly involved in the integration of carbon, nitrogen and energy metabolism in several organisms. To characterize the GlnK protein of S. mutans, the glnK gene was amplified by PCR, and cloned into the expression vectors pET29a(+) and pET28b(+). The native GlnK-Sm was purified by anion exchange (Q-Sepharose) and affinity (Hi-Trap Heparin) chromatography. The GlnK-His-Sm protein was purified using a Hi-Trap Chelating-Ni2+ column. The molecular mass of the GlnK-His-Sm proteins was 85 kDa as determined by gel filtration, indicating that this protein is a hexamer in solution. The GlnK-His-Sm protein is not uridylylated by the Escherichia coli GlnD protein. The activities of the GlnK-Sm and GlnK-His-Sm proteins were assayed in E. coli constitutively expressing the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifLA operon. In K. pneumoniae, NifL inhibits NifA activity in the presence of high ammonium levels and the GlnK protein is required to reduce the inhibition of NifL in the presence of low ammonium levels. The GlnK-Sm protein was unable to reduce NifL inhibition of NifA protein. Surprisingly, the GlnK-His-Sm protein was able to partially reduce NifL inhibition of the NifA protein under nitrogen-limiting conditions, in a manner similar to the GlnK protein of E. coli. These results suggested that S. mutans GlnK is functionally different from E. coli PII proteins.
TI  - Effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for the disinfection of gutta-percha cones.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% peracetic acid for  the disinfection of gutta-percha cones contaminated in vitro with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Bacillus subtilus (in spore form). Two hundred and twenty-five gutta-percha cones were contaminated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The cones were divided into 10 experimental groups (n = 15), according to the microorganism tested and disinfection testing times. The disinfection procedure consisted of immersing each cone in a plastic tube containing the substance. The specimens remained in contact with the substance for 1 or 2.5 minutes. Afterwards, each cone was transferred to a 10% sodium thiosulphate solution (Na(2)S(2)O(3)) to neutralize the disinfectant. Microbial biofilms adhering to the cones were dispersed by agitation. Aliquots of 0.1 ml of the suspensions obtained were plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar, or brain and heart infusion agar, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The results were expressed in colony forming units (CFU/ml) and the data were submitted to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (level of significance at 0.05). A significant reduction was observed, after 1 minute of exposure, in the test solution for C. albicans (p = 0.0190), S. aureus (p = 0.0001), S. mutans (p = 0.0001), B. subtilis (p = 0.0001), and E. coli (p = 0.0001). After 2.5 minutes of exposure, 100% of the microbial inocula were eliminated. It was concluded that the 2% peracetic acid solution was effective against the biofilms of the tested microorganisms on gutta-percha cones at 1 minute of exposure.
TI  - Expression, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (PurN) from Streptococcus mutans was  recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. An effective purification protocol was established. The purified protein, which had a purity of >95%, was identified by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS. The protein was crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method in hanging-drop mode with PEG 3350 as the primary precipitant. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.1 A resolution. Preliminary X-ray analysis indicated that the crystal belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 52.25, b = 63.29, c = 131.81 A.
TI  - Structure of the putative dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is one of the pathogenic species involved in dental caries,  especially in the initiation and development stages. Here, the crystal structure of SMU.595, a putative dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) from S. mutans, is reported at 2.4 A resolution. DHOD is a flavin mononucleotide-containing enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of L-dihydroorotate to orotate, which is the fourth step and the only redox reaction in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. The reductive lysine-methylation procedure was applied in order to improve the diffraction qualities of the crystals. Analysis of the S. mutans DHOD crystal structure shows that this enzyme is a class 1A DHOD and also suggests potential sites that could be exploited for the design of highly specific inhibitors using the structure-based chemotherapeutic design technique.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of SMU.1108c protein from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans SMU.1108c (KEGG database) encodes a functionally uncharacterized protein consisting of 270 amino-acid residues. This protein is predicted to have a haloacid dehalogenase hydrolase-like domain and is a homologue of haloacid dehalogenase phosphatases that catalyze phosphoryl-transfer reactions. In this work, SMU.1108c was cloned into the pET28a vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The protein was purified to homogeneity and crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. The best crystal diffracted to 2.0 A resolution and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=77.1, b=80.2, c=47.9 A, beta=99.5 degrees .
TI  - [Chlorhexidine as a root canal irrigant--antimicrobial and scanning electron microscopic evaluation].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Selection of irrigant is very important for long-term success of root canal therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution (CHX) against five selected microorganisms and to evaluate its efficacy in root canal cleaning. METHODS: In this study, by agar diffusion test, were evaluated antimicrobial effects of three root canal irrigants: 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX. The microorganisms tested in this study were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. A scanning electron microscope was used to evaluate root canal cleaning ability of 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl, 2% CHX and 15% EDTA. Twelve extracted single-root human teeth were divided into four groups depending on the irrigant used during instrumentation. Mechanical preparation was performed with Step back technique and K files. Data were analysed statistically by Student's t-test. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was the most effective against all tested microorganisms. 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX showed antimicrobial effects against all tested microorganisms but zones of inhibition were smaller.The best results in root canal walls cleaning were obtained in the group where the irrigant was 15% EDTA (score 2.33). In 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX groups, there was more smear layer (score 4 and 5). CONCLUSION: 2% chlorhexidine digluconate showed strong antimicrobial effect on the tested microorganisms, but was not effective in cleaning root canal walls.
TI  - Additive effects of orexin B and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on LL-37-mediated antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The present study examined the bactericidal effects of orexin B (ORXB) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) alone or combined with cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as LL-37, on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus. The bactericidal effect of ORXB or VIP alone was detected in low NaCl concentration, but attenuated in physiological NaCl concentration (150 mM). However, such attenuated bactericidal activities of ORXB and VIP in 150 mM NaCl were regained by adding LL-37. Therefore, our results indicate that VIP and ORXB appear to mediate bactericidal effects in concert with LL-37 in the physiological context of mucosal tissue.
TI  - LT-IIc, a new member of the type II heat-labile enterotoxin family, exhibits potent immunomodulatory properties that are different from those induced by LT-IIa or LT-IIb.
AB  - A plethora of human pathogens invade and/or colonize mucosal surfaces. Elaboration of strong, protective immune responses against those pathogens by mucosal vaccination, however, is hampered by endogenous regulatory systems in the mucosae that dampen responses to foreign antigens (Ags). To overcome those natural barriers, mucosal adjuvants must be employed. Using a mouse mucosal immunization model and AgI/II, a weak immunogen from Streptococcus mutans, LT-IIc, a new member of the type II subgroup of the heat-labile enterotoxin family, was shown to have potent mucosal adjuvant properties. In comparison to mice intranasally immunized only with AgI/II, co-administration of AgI/II with LT-IIc enhanced production of Ag-specific IgA antibodies in the saliva and vaginal fluids and Ag-specific IgA and IgG in the serum. Secretion of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha was enhanced in cultures of AgI/II-stimulated splenic cells isolated from mice that had received LT-IIc as a mucosal adjuvant. In contrast, secretion of IL-10 was suppressed in those cells. This pattern of cytokine secretion suggested that LT-IIc stimulates both Th1 and Th2 immune responses. In contrast to LT-IIa and LT-IIb, the original members of the type II subgroup that also are mucosal adjuvants, LT-IIc dramatically enhanced secretion of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta in peritoneal macrophages that had been co-cultured with LPS. Furthermore, the B pentameric subunit of LT-IIc augmented uptake of Ag by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to levels that exceeded those attained by use of LPS or by the B pentamers of LT-IIa or LT-IIb. These data confirmed that LT-IIc is a strong mucosal adjuvant with immunomodulatory properties that are distinguishable from those of LT-IIa and LT-IIb and which has immunomodulatory properties that may be exploitable in vaccine development.
TI  - Deletion of competence-induced genes over-expressed in biofilms caused transformation deficiencies in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Previous studies identified nine genes with increased expression in Streptococcus mutans biofilms of which six possessed putative ComX promoter sequences and were homologous to competence-induced genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii and Bacillus subtilis. As competence increases in biofilms, a study was undertaken into the roles that these biofilm-induced genes might play in transformation. Only five of the nine gene deletions had a significant effect on transformation efficiency. Deletion of the genes for recombinase A, recA, DNA processing protein, dprA and single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ssbA, produced results comparable with those from other bacteria, supporting the contention that these proteins have similar functions in S. mutans competence. The uncharacterized genes SMU.769 and SMU.836 produced results in variance to deletion mutants of putative homologues in S. pneumoniae. Deletion of SMU.769 reduced chromosomal transformation 2.3-fold. SMU.769 belongs to a family of conserved genes induced by the competence-stimulating peptide and which have no established function. In contrast, deletion of SMU.836 reduced transformation of both plasmid and chromosomal DNA to <3%. Homology searches suggested that Smu.836 belongs to a family of competence-induced peptidoglycan hydrolases with a conserved enzyme domain and a species-variable cell-binding domain for which the best characterized member is the choline-binding protein D, CbpD, of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Light insensitive silver(I) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  - Ten silver(I) cyanoximates of AgL composition (L = NC-C(NO)-R, where R is electron withdrawing groups: -CN, -C(O)NR(2), -C(O)R' (alkyl), -C(O)OEt, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. In these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. All studied AgL complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees C. Synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and UV-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and Ag(I) centers. All 10 silver(I) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus hirae, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against Candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of AgL in DMF. Results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. A combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(I) cyanoximates for medical applications. These include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by UV-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of a glucansucrase from the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Glucansucrases encoded by Streptococcus mutans play essential roles in the synthesis of sticky dental plaques. Based on amino-acid sequence similarity, glucansucrases are classified as members of glycoside hydrolase family 70 (GH 70). Data on the crystal structure of GH 70 glucansucrases have yet to be reported. Here, the GH 70 glucansucrase GTF-SI from S. mutans was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), purified to homogeneity and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Orthorhombic GTF-SI crystals belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2 were obtained. A diffraction data set was collected to 2.1 A resolution.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of thymol and carvacrol derivatives.
AB  - Fourteen esters of thymol and carvacrol were synthesized and characterized on the basis of spectral data. The NMR data for some of these are being given for the first time. The antibacterial activity screening of thymol, carvacrol and their esters were carried out against four Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 121, Staphylococcus epidermidis MTCC 435) and one Gram-negative (Escherichia coli MTCC 723) bacteria. The enhancement in activity was noticed in the thymyl ester derivatives 4a-c (against S. mutans, B. subtilis and S. epidermidis) in comparison to thymol, whereas the carvacrol derivatives were found to be much less active than carvacrol.
TI  - The structure of the hypothetical protein smu.1377c from Streptococcus mutans suggests a role in tRNA modification.
AB  - Members of the Sua5_YciO_YrdC protein family are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and possess a conserved alpha/beta twisted open-sheet fold. The Escherichia coli protein YrdC has been shown to be involved in modification of tRNA. The crystal structure of smu.1377c, a hypothetical protein from Streptococcus mutans, has been determined to 2.25 A resolution. From structure analysis and comparison, it is shown that smu.1377c is a member of the Sua5_YciO_YrdC family and that it may play the same role as E. coli YrdC.
TI  - Activity of solvent extracts of Prosopis spicigera, Zingiber officinale and Trachyspermum ammi against multidrug resistant bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging trends of multidrug resistance among several groups of microorganisms against different classes of antibiotics led different researchers to develop efficient drugs from plant sources to counter multidrug resistant strains. This study investigated different solvent extracts of Prosopis spicigera (P. Spicigera), Zingiber officinale, and Trachyspermum ammi (T. ammi) to determine their efficacy against multidrug resistant microbes. METHODOLOGY: Successive extractions of these plants were performed using a Soxhlet apparatus, using solvents with increasing polarities. Preliminary phytochemical analysis was also performed. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by a two-fold serial dilution method followed by determination of minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration. Multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Escherichia coli and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus bovis were used in the study. RESULTS: The ethanolic fraction of P. spicigera (least minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] - 4.88 microg/ml) demonstrated a remarkable inhibition of the microorganisms while fractions obtained from those of Zingiber officinale (least MIC-78.125 microg/ml) exhibited little activity. The petroleum ether fraction of T. ammi (least MIC- 625 microg/ml) showed best activity when compared to its other fractions. Qualitative analysis of the phytoconstituents was also performed. CONCLUSIONS: The potency shown by these extracts recommends their use against multidrug resistant microorganisms. This study also showed that P. spicigera could be a potential source of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of Walsura robusta Roxb.
AB  - Walsura robusta Roxb. (Family: Meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. In the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside A (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of W. robusta. Biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and antigiardial activities was performed. We investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), hydroxyl radical (OH), and superoxide anion (O(2)) scavenging assays. Three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. They scavenged DPPH(*) with IC(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microM. We also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with IC(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microM, respectively. Other biological activities including antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. Preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and S. pyogenes. Aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei. However, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of W. robusta on all tested bacterial strains showed only weak activity, and their MBCs were greater than 25 mg mL(-1). For antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites mL(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg mL(-1) demonstrated no activity (MIC > 1000 microg mL(-1)).
TI  - Preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of SMU.2055 protein from the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The SMU.2055 gene from the major caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans is annotated as a putative acetyltransferase with 163 amino-acid residues. In order to identify its function via structural studies, the SMU.2055 gene was cloned into the expression vector pET28a. Native and SeMet-labelled SMU.2055 proteins with a His(6) tag at the N-terminus were expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+)-chelating affinity chromatography. Diffraction-quality crystals of SeMet-labelled SMU.2055 were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to a resolution of 2.5 A on beamline BL17A at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 92.0, b = 95.0, c = 192.2 A. The asymmetric unit contained four molecules, with a solvent content of 57.1%.
TI  - Healthy properties of proanthocyanidins.
AB  - Proanthocyanidins, also named condensed tannins, are the result of flavanols condensation. Oligomers and polymers of proanthocyanidins can widely be found in the plant kingdom, as in fruits and berries, seeds, flowers, and leaves. They have a putative role as antioxidants, and they affect the inflammatory process via calcium-dependent release of nitric oxide and protect against H(2)O(2)-induced lipid peroxidation. They also demonstrated a role in cardiovascular diseases via vessel relaxation and LDL oxidation inhibition. These condensed tannins have also shown activities that improve diabetic complications, such as neuropathy, retinopathy, or nephropathy, including a decrease in serum glucose and advanced glycation end products. Furthermore, proanthocyanidins have evidenced anticancer properties by mitigating tumor development through induction of apoptosis or inhibition of cell proliferation. Finally, they are able to produce antiadhesive actions against bacteria in urinary and dental infections, including Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans. Hence, proanthocyanidins are considered as beneficial molecules in preventing or treating many diseases and pathological conditions. Therefore, finding out more about condensed tannins bioavailability, and understanding the regulatory genes and pathways involved in their effects should be aimed in future research.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of compounds from the isodon species].
AB  - We investigated antibacterial activities of ten compounds from Isodon species against five strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus mutans, and Helicobacter pylori. The compounds with the MIC values of 25 microg/ml were isodocarpin against Sta. epidermidis, Str. mutans, and H. pylori, nodosin against Sta. epidermidis and Str. mutans, oridonin against Ser. marcescens, and pedalitin against H. pylori.
TI  - Sugar fatty acid esters inhibit biofilm formation by food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Effects of food additives on biofilm formation by food-borne pathogenic bacteria  were investigated. Thirty-three potential food additives and 3 related compounds were added to the culture medium at concentrations from 0.001 to 0.1% (w/w), followed by inoculation and cultivation of five biofilm-forming bacterial strains for the evaluation of biofilm formation. Among the tested food additives, 21 showed inhibitory effects of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and in particular, sugar fatty acid esters showed significant anti-biofilm activity. Sugar fatty acid esters with long chain fatty acid residues (C14-16) exerted their inhibitory effect at the concentration of 0.001% (w/w), but bacterial growth was not affected at this low concentration. Activities of the sugar fatty acid esters positively correlated with the increase of the chain length of the fatty acid residues. Sugar fatty acid esters inhibited the initial attachment of the S. aureus cells to the abiotic surface. Sugar fatty acid esters with long chain fatty acid residues (C14-16) also inhibited biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans and Listeria monocytogenes at 0.01% (w/w), while the inhibition of biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa required the addition of a far higher concentration (0.1% (w/w)) of the sugar fatty acid esters.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, Sealapex and EndoREZ.
AB  - This study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE), Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (Calen/ZO), Sealapex sealer and EndoREZ sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (Kocuria rhizophila, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). Calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and distilled water served as controls. Seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with the test and control materials. After incubation of the plates at 37 degrees C for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). There were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. K. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, while Calen/ZO had its highest antibacterial activity against E. faecalis (p<0.05). S. mutans was inhibited by Calen/ZO, Sealapex and ZOE in the same intensity (p>0.05). E. coli was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, followed by Calen/ZO and Sealapex. Calen/ZO and ZOE were equally effective (p>0.05) against S. aureus, while Sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. EndoREZ presented antibacterial activity only against K. rhizophila and S. aureus. The Calen paste and Calen/ZO produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% CHX when the marker microorganism was E faecalis. In conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: ZOE>Calen/ZO>Sealapex>EndoREZ.
TI  - Preliminary crystallographic studies of purine nucleoside phosphorylase from the  cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The punA gene of the cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans encodes purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), which is a pivotal enzyme in the nucleotide-salvage pathway, catalyzing the phosphorolysis of purine nucleosides to generate purine bases and alpha-ribose 1-phosphate. In the present work, the PNP protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) in a soluble form at a high level. After purification of the PNP enzyme, the protein was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion technique; the crystals diffracted to 1.6 A resolution at best. The crystals belonged to space group H3, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 113.0, c = 60.1 A.
TI  - The Streptococcus mutans IrvR repressor is a CI-like regulator that functions through autocleavage and Clp-dependent proteolysis.
AB  - Previous work has shown that irvR is required for the proper regulation of genetic competence and dextran-dependent aggregation due to its ability to repress the transcription regulator irvA. In this study, we determined the mechanism used to relieve the repression of irvA. We demonstrate that IrvR is a "LexA-like" protein with four conserved amino acid residues likely required for IrvR autocleavage activity. Furthermore, recombinant IrvR protein purified from Escherichia coli was competent to undergo autocleavage in vitro. Using several truncated IrvR constructs, we show that the amino acids adjacent to the autocleavage site are essential for relieving irvA repression and engaging the irvA-dependent regulatory pathway primarily through the ClpXP and ClpCP proteases. By extending the IrvR C terminus with an epitope derived from the autocleavage site, we were also able to create a constitutive Clp-dependent degradation of the full-length IrvR protein. This suggests that the derepression of irvA occurs through a two-step mechanism involving the initial autocleavage of IrvR and exposure of a proteolytic degradation sequence followed by Clp-dependent degradation of the IrvR DNA binding domain. Thus, irvA derepression is highly analogous to the genetic switch mechanism used to regulate lysogeny in bacteriophages.
TI  - Killing of adherent oral microbes by a non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet.
AB  - Atmospheric plasma jets are being intensively studied with respect to potential applications in medicine. The aim of this in vitro study was to test a microwave-powered non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet for its antimicrobial efficacy against adherent oral micro-organisms. Agar plates and dentin slices were inoculated with 6 log(10) c.f.u. cm(-2) of Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, with Escherichia coli as a control. Areas of 1 cm(2) on the agar plates or the complete dentin slices were irradiated with a helium plasma jet for 0.3, 0.6 or 0.9 s mm(-2), respectively. The agar plates were incubated at 37 degrees C, and dentin slices were vortexed in liquid media and suspensions were placed on agar plates. The killing efficacy of the plasma jet was assessed by counting the number of c.f.u. on the irradiated areas of the agar plates, as well as by determination of the number of c.f.u. recovered from dentin slices. A microbe-killing effect was found on the irradiated parts of the agar plates for L. casei, S. mutans, C. albicans and E. coli. The plasma-jet treatment reduced the c.f.u. by 3-4 log(10) intervals on the dentin slices in comparison to recovery rates from untreated controls. The microbe-killing effect was correlated with increasing irradiation times. Thus, non-thermal atmospheric plasma jets could be used for the disinfection of dental surfaces.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of three cements: new endodontic cement (NEC), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland.
AB  - Using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), new endodontic cement (NEC) and Portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar for Escherichia coli (ATCC 10538) and Candida (ATCC 10231). For Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541) and Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) blood agar medium was used. Wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The inhibition zones were then measured. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. The positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for Enterococcus faecalis. NEC created larger inhibition zones than MTA and Portland cement. This difference was significant for Portland cement (P < 0.05), but not for MTA (P > 0.05). Among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for Actinomyces group (P < 0.05). The antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (P < 0.05). It was concluded that NEC is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.
TI  - Roles of TLR2, TLR4, NOD2, and NOD1 in pulp fibroblasts.
AB  - Pulp fibroblasts express various pro-inflammatory mediators leading to marked infiltration of inflammatory cells in the progression of pulpitis. We hypothesized that pulp fibroblasts play roles in the recognition of invaded caries-related bacteria and the subsequent innate immune responses. We found clear expressions of TLR2, NOD1, and NOD2 and a faint expression of TLR4 in human dental pulp fibroblasts (HDPF) by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. We also observed that various pro-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostaglandin E(2) and its key enzyme COX-2, not iNOS or caspase-1, were markedly up-regulated by stimulation with these TLR and NOD agonists. More over, the NOD2 agonist acted synergistically with the TLR2, not the TLR4, agonist to stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in HDPF. These findings indicate that TLR2, TLR4, NOD2, and NOD1 in HDPF are functional receptors, and NOD2 is a modulator of signals transmitted through TLR2 in pulpal immune responses, leading to progressive pulpitis.
TI  - Role of phosphoglucosamine mutase on virulence properties of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus mutans has been strongly implicated as the principal  etiological agent in dental caries. As a gram-positive bacterium, S. mutans has a thick and compact cell wall to maintain the cell shape and protect the cells against mechanical or osmotic damage. Previous studies have proved that peptidoglycan is the main component of the cell wall involved in the autolysis or biofilm formation processes. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the gene SMU.1426c in the amino-sugar metabolism pathway of S. mutans UA159, which encodes phosphoglucosamine mutase (GlmM). The glmM gene that functions in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan has been well investigated in Escherichia coli. Here a glmM mutant strain of S. mutans UA159 was constructed and several virulence properties were investigated. RESULTS: The mutant devoid of the glmM gene displayed long chains, reduced growth rate and increased autolysis. Biofilm formation by the mutant was found to be attenuated. CONCLUSION: These results proved that peptidoglycan biosynthesis plays an important part in a series of bacterial morphologies. The glmM gene may have a constructive role in the virulence properties of S. mutans.
TI  - Effect of three methods for cleaning dentures on biofilms formed in vitro on acrylic resin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three denture hygiene methods against different microbial biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The set (sterile stainless steel basket and specimens) was contaminated (37 degrees C for 48 hours) by a microbial inoculum with 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml (standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis; field strains: S. mutans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis). After inoculation, specimens were cleansed by the following methods: (1) chemical: immersion in an alkaline peroxide solution (Bonyplus tablets) for 5 minutes; (2) mechanical: brushing with a dentifrice for removable prostheses (Dentu Creme) for 20 seconds; and (3) a combination of chemical and mechanical methods. Specimens were applied onto a Petri plate with appropriate culture medium for 10 minutes. Afterward, the specimens were removed and the plates incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. RESULTS: Chemical, mechanical, and combination methods showed no significant difference in the reduction of CFU for S. aureus, S. mutans (ATCC and field strain), and P. aeruginosa. Mechanical and combination methods were similar and more effective than the chemical method for E. faecalis, C. albicans (ATCC and field strain), and C. glabrata. The combination method was better than the chemical method for E. coli and C. tropicalis, and the mechanical method showed intermediate results. CONCLUSION: The three denture hygiene methods showed different effects depending on the type of microbial biofilms formed on acrylic base resin specimens.
TI  - Coaggregation between probiotic bacteria and caries-associated strains: an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro abilities of probiotic bacteria derived from  consumer products to coaggregate with caries-associated mutans streptococci. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus (CCUG 5917), L. plantarum 299v, L. rhamnosus GG and LB21, L. paracasei F19, L. reuteri PTA5289) were cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C in Man Rogosa Sharpe (MSB) broth for 24 h. Four strains of human streptococci (S. mutans Ingbritt, S. mutans (ATCC 25175), S. mutans GS-5, S. sobrinus (ATCC 33478) were similarly grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. A gastrointestinal pathogen (Escherichia coli) was aerobically cultivated on BHI broth as a positive control. After incubation, the bacteria were aerobically harvested, washed, and suspended in 10 mmol/l phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). The probiotic strains were characterized with the API 50 CH system to confirm their identity. Coaggregation was determined by spectrophotometry in mixtures and bacterial suspensions alone after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h and expressed as the aggregation ratio (%). RESULTS: All probiotic strains showed coaggregation abilities with the oral pathogens and the results were strain specific and dependent on time. S. mutans GS-5 exhibited a significantly higher ability to coaggregate with all the probiotic strains than the other mutans streptococci and E. coli. The differences among the probiotic strains were modest with L. acidophilus being the most prone and L. rhamnosus LB21 the least prone to coaggregate with the oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated different abilities of lactobacilli-derived probiotic bacteria to coaggregate with selected oral streptococci. Aggregation assays may be a useful complement for screening of probiotic candidates with possible anti-caries properties.
TI  - Radical Scavenging Activity of the Essential Oil of Silver Fir (Abies alba).
AB  - The essential oil of silver fir (Abies alba) is known to help respiratory system  and have easing and soothing effect for muscle. In the present study, we investigated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and its biological activities of silver fir (Abies alba) essential oil. The composition of the oil was analyzed by GC-MS and bornyl acetate (30.31%), camphene (19.81%), 3-carene (13.85%), tricyclene (12.90%), dl-limonene (7.50%), alpha-pinene (2.87%), caryophyllene (2.18%), beta-phellandrene (2.13%), borneol (1.74%), bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene,2,3-dimethyl (1.64%) and alpha-terpinene (1.24%) were the major components in the oil. The results tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that the oil showed no cytotoxic effect, at concentrations of 1 and 5%, for as long as 24 and 3 h, respectively. The antiradical capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oil on the 2,20-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radicals. The oil was able to reduce the both radicals dose-dependently, and the concentration required for 50% reduction (RC(50)) against DPPH radicals (2.7 +/- 0.63%) was lower than ABTS radicals (8.5 +/- 0.27%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was also evaluated using disc diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio parahaemolyticcus. The oil exhibited no antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested except S. aureus of mild activity.
TI  - 3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate phosphatase activity is required for superoxide  stress tolerance in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Aerobic microorganisms have evolved different strategies to withstand environmental oxidative stresses generated by various reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the facultative anaerobic human oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, the mechanisms used to protect against ROS are not fully understood, since it does not possess catalase, an enzyme that degrades hydrogen peroxide. In order to elucidate the genes that are essential for superoxide stress response, methyl viologen (MV)-sensitive mutants of S. mutans were generated via ISS1 mutagenesis. Screening of approximately 2,500 mutants revealed six MV-sensitive mutants, each containing an insertion in one of five genes, including a highly conserved hypothetical gene, SMU.1297. Sequence analysis suggests that SMU.1297 encodes a hypothetical protein with a high degree of homology to the Bacillus subtilis YtqI protein, which possesses an oligoribonuclease activity that cleaves nano-RNAs and a phosphatase activity that degrades 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (pAp) and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (pApS) to produce AMP; the latter activity is similar to the activity of the Escherichia coli CysQ protein, which is required for sulfur assimilation. SMU.1297 was deleted using a markerless Cre-loxP-based strategy; the SMU.1297 deletion mutant was just as sensitive to MV as the ISS1 insertion mutant. Complementation of the deletion mutant with wild-type SMU.1297, in trans, restored the parental phenotype. Biochemical analyses with purified SMU.1297 protein demonstrated that it has pAp phosphatase activity similar to that of YtqI but apparently lacks an oligoribonuclease activity. The ability of SMU.1297 to dephosphorylate pApS in vivo was confirmed by complementation of an E. coli cysQ mutant with SMU.1297 in trans. Thus, our results suggest that SMU.1297 is involved in superoxide stress tolerance in S. mutans. Furthermore, the distribution of homologs of SMU.1297 in streptococci indicates that this protein is essential for superoxide stress tolerance in these organisms.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of SMU.412c protein from the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The smu.412c gene encodes a putative histidine triad-like protein (SMU.412c) with 139 residues that is involved in cell-cycle regulation in Streptococcus mutans. The gene was cloned into the expression vector pET28a and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) to give a substantially soluble form of SMU.412c with a His(6) tag at its N-terminus. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity in a two-step procedure involving Ni(2+)-chelating and size-exclusion chromatography. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to 1.8 A resolution on beamline BL6A at Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The crystal belonged to space group P4(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 53.5, c = 141.1 A.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of three dUTPases from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - All organisms examined to date possess a dUTPase that performs the important function of efficiently hydrolyzing dUTP to dUMP in order to prevent the incorporation of dUTP into DNA. Three putative dUTPases from Gram-positive bacteria have been studied in this work. Two dUTPase-encoding genes, yncF and yosS, have been identified in Bacillus subtilis. The gene dut, encoding dUTPase from the dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans, was amplified from S. mutans genomic DNA. The three genes were cloned into expression vectors and overexpressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. Each protein was purified in two steps using chromatographic methods. Crystals of the YosS and YncF proteins and of S. mutans dUTPase were obtained using the vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected from crystals of selenomethionine-labelled YosS and S. mutans dUTPase to resolutions of 2.3 and 1.7 A, respectively. The crystal of native YncF diffracted to 2.7 A resolution.
TI  - Cranberry constituents affect fructosyltransferase expression in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - CONTEXT: Cranberry juice has long been recognized in folk medicine as a therapeutic agent, mainly in urinary tract infections. Its proposed mechanism of action is antiadhesion of bacteria. OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the potential antiadhesion effect of nondialyzed material of cranberry (NDM) via its influence on secretion, gene expression, and promoter activity of the fructosyltransferase (FTF), which is among the extracellular enzymes associated with dental biofilm formation and pathogenesis of oral bacteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Secretion of FTF from Streptococcus mutans, in the presence of NDM, was measured by immunoblotting and confocal scanning laser microscopy. Its influence on ftf gene expression was determined by reverse transcription followed by real-time RT-PCR. The luciferase assay was used to detect bioluminescence expressed by the ftf promoter activity of bacteria exposed to NDM. RESULTS: NDM at concentrations between 0.2/mL and 1mg/mL significantly (P<.05) decreased secretion of extracellular FTF, as well as down-regulated ftf expression in a dose-dependent manner. NDM also markedly reduced the luciferase activity under the ftf promoter.
TI  - Inactivation of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans by ultrasound at 500kHz.
AB  - This paper shows a systematic study of the 500 kHz frequency ultrasound efficiency on the microbial inactivation as a function of ultrasonic power delivered into the bacterial suspension. The inactivation of Escherichia coli IAM 12058, a Gram-negative bacterium and Streptococcus mutans JCM 5175, a Gram-positive bacterium is enhanced by increasing the ultrasonic power in the range of 1.7-12.4W and the logarithm of survival ratio decreases linearly with irradiation time, except for E. coli sonicated with the highest power level. The rate constants were estimated in the linear region of the plots representing survival ratio logarithm vs. sonication time. A better understanding of the inactivation process at 500kHz could be gained by suppressing the chemical effects with a radical scavenger. We find out that the rate constants increase with the ultrasonic power delivered into the solution and dramatically decrease by the addition of t-butanol as a radical scavenger to the bacterial suspension. For comparison, experiments were carried out at a low frequency level of 20kHz. It was found out that for the same ultrasonic power delivered into the bacterial suspension, the inactivation was slightly enhanced at 500kHz frequency. The examinations of bacterium performed with a TEM revealed lethal damages arising from the interaction of bacterial cells with the cavitational bubbles. A significant amount of empty cell envelopes as well as their cytoplasmatic content was detected. Thus, based on these new data, the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by ultrasounds at high frequency is discussed here.
TI  - Eugenol derivatives immobilized in auto-polymerizing formulations as an approach  to avoid inhibition interferences and improve biofunctionality in dental and orthopedic cements.
AB  - Auto-polymerizing formulations based on poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) and eugenol derivatives are reported for dental and orthopedic applications. Spherical beads of PEMA were used as the pre-polymer powder and mixed with combinations of ethyl methacrylate and eugenyl methacrylate (EgMA) or ethoxyeugenyl methacrylate (EEgMA). A range of concentrations from 10 to 30 wt.% of EgMA or EEgMA were used to impart bioactivity properties to the cements. Increasing concentrations of the eugenol derivatives decreased the maximum polymerization temperatures from 69 to 37 degrees C without altering the working or setting time. At concentrations of 10 and 15 wt.% of EgMA or EEgMA a noticeable increase in the compressive (8%), flexural (40%) and tensile (24%) strengths were recorded in comparison to the control cements containing PEMA/ethyl methacrylate only. In addition to the improvement in mechanical properties the cements yielded a slightly crosslinked network due to the participation of the allylic group present in the eugenol derivatives, the presence of which has an intrinsically bactericidal effect against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans strains, as reported in a previous study, thus enhancing the properties of the cements.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Crystal structures of phosphotransferase system enzymes PtxB (IIB(Asc)) and PtxA  (IIA(Asc)) from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is the primary etiological agent of dental caries in man and other mammalian organisms. This bacterium metabolizes carbohydrates actively and thrives under anaerobic conditions by fermenting l-ascorbate (Asc) via the sga operon, which includes SgaT, PtxB, and PtxA. These three proteins are members of the Asc family of enzyme II (EII) complexes of the bacterial phosphotransferase system. Here, we report the crystal structure of PtxB, solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing, and that of PtxA, solved by molecular replacement, from S. mutans. PtxB provides the first crystal structure of an EIIB from the Asc family, composed of a central beta sheet of parallel strands flanked by alpha helices on both sides. The structure of PtxB is similar to the structures of IIB(Mtl) (IIB subunit of mannitol PTS) and IIB(Cel) (IIB subunit of cellobiose) in Escherichia coli despite the low sequence identity. PtxA adopts a globular alpha/beta sandwich structure. The phosphorylation-site His68 is situated between beta2 and beta3, within a hydrophobic pocket. We found that the hydrogen bond on N(delta1) of the active-site histidine is a common means of ensuring that phosphate is on the correct N(varepsilon2) site in many EIIA families. Finally, a model of the PtxB-PtxA complex was constructed, and a PtxA-phospho-PtxB state is proposed. Analyses of the two structures shed light on the catalytic mechanism of the phosphotransferase system.
TI  - Constituents and antimicrobial properties of blue honeysuckle: a novel source for phenolic antioxidants.
AB  - The fruit of Lonicera caerulea L. (blue honeysuckle; Caprifoliaceae) and its phenolic fraction were analyzed for nutrients and micronutrients. The phenolic fraction was prepared from berries percolated with 0.1% H3PO4 and SPE using Sepabeads SP207. The sugar and lipid content was analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. The total content of anthocyanins was determined using the pH differential absorbance method and aliphatic acids by capillary electrophoresis. MicroLC-MS/MS was used for determination of cyanidin-3-glucoside (the predominant anthocyanin), 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, paeonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, quercetin, its 3-glucoside, and 3-rutinoside, epicatechin, protocatechuic, gentisic, ellagic, ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and coumaric acids. The phenolic fraction displayed Folin-Ciocalteu reagent reducing (335 +/- 15 microg of gallic acid equivalent/mg) and DPPH and superoxide scavenging activity (IC50 12.1 +/- 0.1 and 115.5 +/- 6.4 microg/mL) and inhibited rat liver microsome peroxidation (IC50 160 +/- 20 microg/mL). The freeze-dried fruit and its phenolic fraction reduced the biofilm formation and adhesion to the artificial surface of Candida parapsilosis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Reduction in bacterial contamination of toothbrushes using the Violight ultraviolet light activated toothbrush sanitizer.
AB  - PURPOSE: This two armed, self-controlled, investigator blinded, clinical study tested the efficacy of an ultraviolet (UV) light toothbrush holder (Violight) to decrease toothbrush bacterial contamination. METHODS: 25 subjects were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups and received two toothbrushes for home use on either even or odd days. The control group rinsed both toothbrushes after use in cold tap water with no mechanical manipulation. The experimental group rinsed one toothbrush in cold running water while storing the other toothbrush in the Violight toothbrush holder after use. The toothbrushes were returned after 2 weeks use in sealed plastic bags and were analyzed for the number of colony forming units (CFU) of S. mutans, S. salivarius, lactobacilli, E. coli, and other coliforms, and total bacterial counts by culture. An additional analysis of the total bacterial profile was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The Violight toothbrush holder reduced total CFU by an average of 86% (ANCOVA, P = 0.037). In addition, a tendency was noted for a reduction in total bacterial population as detected by DGGE.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of Ag/Cu/HAP with platelet morphology.
AB  - As a useful starting material in coating technology and preparation of HAP/polymers composites the platelet Ag/Cu/HAP was prepared using the solid solution of HAP reacting with the mix-solution of silver and copper nitrate. Its composition, microstructure and properties were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and anti-bacterial or bacteriostatic tests. The results demonstrate that the prepared Ag/Cu/HAP crystal is mainly comprised of HAP phase with little whitelockite and silver phosphate, stable up to 600 degrees C and takes a platelet shape. At 750 degrees C, it is partially changed into whitelockite, calcium copper phosphate, silver oxide and silver phosphate. The platelet Ag/Cu/HAP crystal has a preferential orientation of a-axis below 600 degrees C, above which the growth in a-axis is greatly inhibited. The Ag/Cu/HAP has good crystallinity at 600 degrees C and is the most effective powder in resisting bacteria among the HAP powders investigated. The platelet Ag/Cu/HAP crystal can be good starting materials to make antibacterial polymers/HAP composites and HAP coatings.
TI  - Biochemical characterisation of a glycogen branching enzyme from Streptococcus mutans: Enzymatic modification of starch.
AB  - A gene encoding a putative glycogen branching enzyme (SmGBE) in Streptococcus mutans was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The biochemical properties of the purified enzyme were examined relative to its branching specificity for amylose and starch. The activity of the approximately 75kDa enzyme was optimal at pH 5.0, and stable up to 40 degrees C. The enzyme predominantly transferred short maltooligosyl chains with a degree of polymerization (dp) of 6 and 7 throughout the branching process for amylose. When incubated with rice starch, the enzyme modified its optimal branch chain-length from dp 12 to 6 with large reductions in the longer chains, and simultaneously increased its branching points. The results indicate that SmGBE can make a modified starch with much shorter branches and a more branched structure than to native starch. In addition, starch retrogradation due to low temperature storage was significantly retarded along with the enzyme reaction.
TI  - The macrophage scavenger receptor CD163 functions as an innate immune sensor for  bacteria.
AB  - The plasma membrane glycoprotein receptor CD163 is a member of the scavenger receptor cystein-rich (SRCR) superfamily class B that is highly expressed on resident tissue macrophages in vivo. Previously, the molecule has been shown to act as a receptor for hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes and to mediate cell-cell interactions between macrophages and developing erythroblasts in erythroblastic islands. Here, we provide evidence for a potential role for CD163 in host defense. In particular, we demonstrate that CD163 can function as a macrophage receptor for bacteria. CD163 was shown to bind both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and a previously identified cell-binding motif in the second scavenger domain of CD163 was sufficient to mediate this binding. Expression of CD163 in monocytic cells promoted bacteria-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. Finally, newly generated antagonistic antibodies against CD163 were able to potently inhibit cytokine production elicited by bacteria in freshly isolated human monocytes. These findings identify CD163 as a macrophage receptor for bacteria and suggest that, during bacterial infection, CD163 on resident tissue macrophages acts as an innate immune sensor and inducer of local inflammation.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, gamma interferon, and a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix form a synergistic trio that induces c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1-mediated nitric oxide generation and cell death.
AB  - During infection and inflammation, bacterial and inflammatory proteases break down extracellular matrices into macromolecular fragments. Fibronectin fragments are associated with disease severity in arthritis and periodontitis. The mechanisms by which these fragments contribute to disease pathogenesis are unclear. One likely mechanism is that fibronectin fragments induce apoptosis of resident cells, which can be further modulated by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide levels are increased at inflammatory sites in periodontitis patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix (AFn) exerts its action by inducing nitric oxide and whether priming by bacterial and inflammatory components exacerbates this mechanism. Our data demonstrate that AFn increased the levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) dose and time dependently in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. These effects and apoptosis were inhibited by iNOS suppression and enhanced by iNOS overexpression. Nitric oxide and iNOS induction were paralleled by increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) phosphorylation. JNK-1 overexpression enhanced the expression of nitric oxide and iNOS, whereas inhibiting JNK-1 by small interfering RNA or a kinase mutant reversed these findings. Priming PDL cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis, its lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) further increased nitric oxide levels and apoptosis. Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans induced lesser effects. Gingival fibroblasts and neutrophils responded to a lesser degree to these stimuli, whereas keratinocytes were resistant to apoptosis. Thus, proapoptotic matrices trigger nitric oxide release via JNK-1, promoting further apoptosis in host cells. LPS and IFN-gamma accentuate this mechanism, suggesting that during inflammation, the affected matrices and bacterial and inflammatory components combined exert a greater pathogenic effect on host cells.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus gordonii prophage PH15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii OMZ1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, PH15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. Phage PH15 belongs to the Siphoviridae. The complete genome sequence of PH15 was determined. The genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 ORFs. The genome of PH15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages MM1 and phiNIH1.1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. In strain OMZ1039, PH15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-tRNA gene. A plasmid, harbouring the attP site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. The phage endolysin was purified after expression in Escherichia coli and found to inhibit growth of all S. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - [Characterization and antibacterial effect of Ag-nHA-nTiO2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (Ag-nHA-nTiO2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (PA66) by co-polymerization method. The purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. METHODS: The morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. RESULTS: XRD results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (HA). A homogeneous distribution of the Ca, P, Ti and Ag element in the membrane was confirmed by EDX. Both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by SEM and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. The bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of S. aureus and 56.31% of E. coli were killed. However, 91.84% of P. gingivalis, 90.64% of F. nucleatum and 90.49% of S. mutans were killed and pictures of SEM showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. CONCLUSION: The nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Effectiveness of six different disinfectants on removing five microbial species and effects on the topographic characteristics of acrylic resin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfectant  solutions (1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate, 2% glutaraldehyde, 100% vinegar, tabs of sodium perborate-based denture cleanser, and 3.8% sodium perborate) in the disinfection of acrylic resin specimens (n = 10/group) contaminated in vitro by Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, or Bacillus subtilis as measured by residual colony-forming unit (CFU). In a separate experiment, acrylic resin was treated with disinfectants to monitor potential effects on surface roughness, Ra (microm), which might facilitate microbial adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred fifty acrylic resin specimens contaminated in vitro with 1 x 10(6) cells/ml suspensions of standard strains of the cited microorganisms were immersed in the disinfectants for 10 minutes; the control group was not submitted to any disinfection process. Final counts of microorganisms per ml were performed by plating method for the evaluation of microbial level reduction. Results were compared statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test (p< or = 0.05). In a parallel study aiming to evaluate the effect of the tested disinfectant on resin surface, 60 specimens were analyzed in a digital rugosimeter before and after ten cycles of 10-minute immersion in the disinfectants. Measurements of superficial roughness, Ra (mum), were compared statistically by paired t-test (p< or = 0.05). RESULTS: The results showed that 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% glutaraldehyde, and 2% chlorhexidine digluconate were most effective against the analyzed microorganisms, followed by 100% vinegar, 3.8% sodium perborate, and tabs of sodium perborate-based denture cleanser. Superficial roughness of the specimens was higher after disinfection cycles with 3.8% sodium perborate (p= 0.03) and lower after the cycles with 2% chlorhexidine digluconate (p= 0.04). CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this experiment, it could be concluded that 1% sodium hypochlorite, 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% chlorhexidine, 100% vinegar, and 3.8% sodium perborate are valid alternatives for the disinfection of acrylic resin.
TI  - Bacterial DNA sample preparation from whole blood using surface-modified Si pillar arrays.
AB  - A novel bacterial DNA sample preparation device for molecular diagnostics has been developed. On the basis of optimized conditions for bacterial adhesion, surface-modified silicon pillar arrays for bacterial cell capture were fabricated, and their ability to capture bacterial cells was demonstrated. The capture efficiency for bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus mutans in buffer solution was over 75% with a flow rate of 400 microL/min. Moreover, the proposed method captured E. coli cells present in 50% whole blood effectively. The captured cells from whole blood were then in- situ lyzed on the surface of the microchip, and the eluted DNA was successfully amplified by qPCR. These results demonstrate that the full process of pathogen capture to DNA isolation from whole blood could be automated in a single microchip.
TI  - Intrinsically antibacterial materials based on polymeric derivatives of eugenol for biomedical applications.
AB  - Infections are the most common cause of biomaterial implant failure representing  a constant challenge to the more widespread application of medical implants. This study reports on the preparation and characterization of novel hydrophilic copolymeric systems provided with antibacterial properties coming from eugenol residues anchored to the macromolecular chains. Thus, high conversion copolymers were prepared from the hydrophilic monomer 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and different eugenol monomeric derivatives, eugenyl methacrylate (EgMA) and ethoxyeugenyl methacrylate (EEgMA), by bulk polymerization reaction. Thermal evaluation revealed glass transition temperature values in the range 95-58 degrees C following the order HEMA-co-EgMA > PHEMA > HEMA-co-EEgMA and a clear increase in thermal stability with the presence of any eugenyl monomer in the system. In vitro wettability studies showed a reduction of water sorption capacity and surface free energy values with increasing the content of eugenol residues in the copolymer. The antimicrobial activity of copolymeric discs was evaluated by determining their capacity to reduce or inhibit colony formation by different bacterial species. All eugenyl containing materials showed bacteria growth inhibition, this one being higher for the EEgMA derivative copolymers.
TI  - Amylase-binding protein B of Streptococcus gordonii is an extracellular dipeptidyl-peptidase.
AB  - The oral commensal bacterium Streptococcus gordonii interacts with salivary amylase via two amylase-binding proteins, AbpA and AbpB. Based on sequence analysis, the 20-kDa AbpA protein is unique to S. gordonii, whereas the 82-kDa AbpB protein appears to share sequence homology with other bacterial dipeptidases. The aim of this study was to verify the peptidase activity of AbpB and further explore its potential functions. The abpB gene was cloned, and histidine-tagged AbpB (His-AbpB) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Its amylase-binding activity was verified in an amylase ligand binding assay, and its cross-reactivity was verified with an anti-AbpB antibody. Both recombinant His-AbpB and partially purified native AbpB displayed dipeptidase activity and degraded human type VI collagen and fibrinogen, but not salivary amylase. Salivary amylase precipitates not only AbpA and AbpB but also glucosyltransferase G (Gtf-G) from S. gordonii supernatants. Since Streptococcus mutans also releases Gtf enzymes that could also be involved in multispecies plaque interactions, the effect of S. gordonii AbpB on S. mutans Gtf-B activity was also tested. Salivary amylase and/or His-AbpB caused a 1.4- to 2-fold increase of S. mutans Gtf-B sucrase activity and a 3- to 6-fold increase in transferase activity. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay verified the interaction of His-AbpB and amylase with Gtf-B. In summary, AbpB demonstrates proteolytic activity and interacts with and modulates Gtf activity. These activities may help explain the crucial role AbpB appears to play in S. gordonii oral colonization.
TI  - Towards on-site pathogen detection using antibody-based sensors.
AB  - In this paper, the recent progress within biosensors for plant pathogen detection will be reviewed. Bio-recognition layers on sensors can be designed in various ways, however the most popular approach is to immobilise antibodies for specific capture of analytes. Focus will be put on antibody surface-immobilisation strategies as well as the use of antibodies in the widely used sensors, quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance and cantilevers. We will describe the available data on antibody-based plant pathogen detection and furthermore use examples from detection of the pathogens Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli. We will touch upon optimal assay design and further discuss the strengths and limitations of current sensor technologies for detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  - Many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), displayed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. SP, NPY, VIP and CGRP displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of S. aureus. These antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
TI  - Protein preparation, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of N-acetylglutamate kinase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The N-acetylglutamate kinase from Streptococcus mutans was expressed in Escherichia coli in soluble form and purified to homogeneity. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method and diffracted to 2.06 A. The crystal belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2, with unit cell parameters a = 57.19 A, b =94.76 A, c =47.58 A. The gel filtration and initial phasing results showed that the enzyme exists as a monomer, which is different from previously reported N-acetylglutamate kinases.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - SO-LAAO, a novel L-amino acid oxidase that enables Streptococcus oligofermentans  to outcompete Streptococcus mutans by generating H2O2 from peptone.
AB  - We previously demonstrated that Streptococcus oligofermentans suppressed the growth of Streptococcus mutans, the primary cariogenic pathogen, by producing hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) through lactate oxidase activity. In this study, we found that the lox mutant of S. oligofermentans regained the inhibition while growing on peptone-rich plates. Further studies demonstrated that the H(2)O(2) produced on peptone by S. oligofermentans was mainly derived from seven L-amino acids, i.e., L-aspartic acid, L-tryptophan, L-lysine, L-isoleucine, L-arginine, L-asparagine, and L-glutamine, indicating the possible existence of L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) that can produce H(2)O(2) from L-amino acids. Through searching the S. oligofermentans genome for open reading frames with a conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide binding motif that exists in the known LAAOs, including those of snake venom, fungi, and bacteria, a putative LAAO gene, assigned as aao(So), was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein, SO-LAAO, showed a molecular mass of 43 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and catalyzed H(2)O(2) formation from the seven L-amino acids determined above, thus confirming its LAAO activity. The SO-LAAO identified in S. oligofermentans differed evidently from the known LAAOs in both substrate profile and sequence, suggesting that it could represent a novel LAAO. An aao(So) mutant of S. oligofermentans did lose H(2)O(2) formation from the seven L-amino acids, further verifying its function as an LAAO. Furthermore, the inhibition by S. oligofermentans of S. mutans in a peptone-rich mixed-species biofilm was greatly reduced for the aao(So) mutant, indicating the gene's importance in interspecies competition.
TI  - Characterization of a silver-incorporated calcium phosphate film by RBS and its antimicrobial effects.
AB  - A thin calcium phosphate film was synthesized on both commercially pure Ti and Si wafers by electron beam evaporation of hydroxyapatite as an evaporant with simultaneous Ar ion beam bombardments. Silver was introduced into an ion-beam-assisted deposition of a calcium phosphate thin film for antimicrobial effect. The amount of incorporated silver ions was controlled by immersing calcium-phosphate-coated samples in different AgNO(3) concentrations, and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) was employed to measure the amounts of substituted silver. The higher concentration of silver in the calcium phosphate film was more effective in reducing the bacteria of Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Streptococcus mutans OMZ 65 on contact with respect to controls.
TI  - Ring-opening mechanism revealed by crystal structures of NagB and its ES intermediate complex.
AB  - Glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase (NagB) catalyzes the conversion of d-glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) to d-fructose 6-phosphate and ammonia. This reaction is the final step of N-acetylglucosamine utilization and decides its metabolic fate. The enzyme from Streptococcus mutans belongs to the monomeric subfamily of NagB. The crystal structure of the native SmuNagB (NagB from S. mutans) presented here, compared with the structures of its homologs BsuNagB (NagB from Bacillus subtilis) and EcoNagB (NagB from E. coli), implies a conformational change of the 'lid' motif in the activation of the monomeric NagB enzyme. We have also captured the enzyme-substrate intermediate complex of the NagB family at low pH, where a remarkable loss of the catalytic activity of SmuNagB was detected. The enzyme-substrate intermediate presents the initial step of the GlcN6P deaminase reaction. The structural evidence (1) supports the alpha-anomer of GlcN6P as the specific natural substrate of NagB; (2) displays the substrate-binding pocket at the active site; and (3) together with the site-directed mutagenesis studies, demonstrates the ring-opening mechanism of an Asn-His-Glu triad that performs the proton transfer from O1 to O5 to open the sugar ring.
TI  - [Detection of quorum-sensing pathway and construction of luxS gene allelic exchange plasmid of Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the AI-2 quorum-sensing pathway and construct the luxS g-ene allelic exchange plasmid of Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: To detect AI-2 pathway in Streptococcus mutans, the Vibrio harveyi BB170 was used as reporter strain. The PCR fragments of the upstream and downstream regions of luxS and the Erythromycin resistance gene were amplified with the primers respectively, and these fragments were ligated into pUC19 vector with double endonuclease reaction sequentially, the ligated DNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5alpha, then the reconstructed plasmids were isolated and identified by restricted endonuclease digestions. RESULTS: Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt C could induce luminescence of BB170, suggesting the presence of AI-2 quorum sensing pathway in Streptococcus mutans, and such stimulatory activity was maximal at the mid-log growth phase. The recombinant plasmid pUCluxKO was digested by PstI-BamHI, and the digest product were 1000 bp and 5000 bp. When the pUCluxKO was digested by BamHI-KpnI, the digest product were 1500 bp and 4500 bp. While it was digested by KpnI-EcoRI, the digest product were 1000 bp and 5000 bp. All PCR product was in a single belt respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The recombinant plasmid was cloned effectively and can be used in the construction of S.mutans luxS mutant.
TI  - Chemoenzymatic synthesis of polyprenyl phosphates.
AB  - Polyprenyl phosphates, including undecaprenyl phosphate and dolichyl phosphate, are essential intermediates in several important biochemical pathways including N-linked protein glycosylation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and prokaryotic cell wall biosynthesis. Herein, we describe the evaluation of three potential undecaprenol kinases as agents for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of polyprenyl phosphates. Target enzymes were expressed in crude cell envelope fractions and quantified via the use of luminescent lanthanide-binding tags (LBTs). The Streptococcus mutans diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) was shown to be a very useful agent for polyprenol phosphorylation using ATP as the phosphoryl transfer agent. In addition, the S. mutans DGK can be coupled with two Campylobacter jejuni glycosyltransferases involved in N-linked glycosylation to efficiently biosynthesize the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-linked disaccharide needed for studies of PglB, the C. jejuni oligosaccharyl transferase.
TI  - Biochemical and molecular characterization of a novel type of Mutanase from Paenibacillus sp. strain RM1: identification of its mutan-binding domain, essential for degradation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  - A novel type of mutanase (termed mutanase RM1) was isolated from Paenibacillus sp. strain RM1. The purified enzyme specifically hydrolyzed alpha-1,3-glucan (mutan) and effectively degraded biofilms formed by Streptococcus mutans, a major etiologic agent in the progression of dental caries, even following brief incubation. The nucleotide sequence of the gene for this protein contains a 3,873-bp open reading frame encoding 1,291 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 135 kDa. The protein contains two major domains, the N-terminal domain (277 residues) and the C-terminal domain (937 residues), separated by a characteristic sequence composed of proline and threonine repeats. The characterization of the recombinant proteins for each domain which were expressed in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the N-terminal domain had strong mutan-binding activity but no mutanase activity whereas the C-terminal domain was responsible for mutanase activity but had mutan-binding activity significantly lower than that of the intact protein. Importantly, the biofilm-degrading activity observed with the intact protein was not exhibited by either domain alone or in combination with the other. Therefore, these results indicate that the structural integrity of mutanase RM1 containing the N-terminal mutan-binding domain is required for the biofilm-degrading activity.
TI  - A new, simple approach to confer permanent antimicrobial properties to hydroxylated surfaces by surface functionalization.
AB  - A new, simple method to obtain ultrathin polycationic monolayers on hydroxylated  surfaces is described which uses a bifunctional copolymer comprising a reactive part (trimethoxysilane) and positive charges (quaternary ammonium salts) to confer antimicrobial properties.
TI  - [Purification and properties of an antimicrobial substance from marine Brevibacillus laterosporus Lh-1].
AB  - An antimicrobial substance produced by Brevibacillus laterosporus isolated from the sea sediment was purified and characterized. The antimicrobial substance was purified by ultrafiltration, DEAE-Sepharose Fast flow chromatography, CM-Sepharose Fast flow chromatography and HPLC reversed phase column chromatography, and after the final purification step, one active fraction was obtained, designated R-1. The molecular weight (MW) was accurately determined by MALDI-TOF-MS as 1608.023 Da. And its pI was determined with Rotofor Cell BIO-RAD to be 8.55. Amino acid analysis of the purified R-1 showed that it was composed of Leu, Tyr, Val, Ile, Lys, Gly, Met, Ser and Ala. Most of them were hydrophobic and neutral amino acid except Lys which was a basic amino acid. And this accorded with pI of R-1. R-1 remained active over a wide temperature range and it also was active over a broad pH rang. R-1 was insusceptible to pancreatin, pepsin and alkaline proteinase. Agar radial diffusion assay showed that R-1 had low minimun bactericidal concentration against Gram-Positive Bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureaus, Clostridium and Gram- egative Bacteria such as Escherichia coli Pseudomonas putrefaciens And R-1 had antibacterial activities against Candida albicans
TI  - The utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  - There is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in Gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. In this study, we utilized an E. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pVT1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pVPT-CTag and pVPT-NTag, with each set containing five affinity tags (GST, GFP, HSV, T7 and Nano) that can be fused to either the C- or N-terminus of a target protein. A putative glycosyltransferase (Gtf2) essential for Fap1 glycosylation was used to demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of Gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain Streptococcus parasanguinis. GFP and T7 tags were readily expressed in S. parasanguinis as either an N- or C-terminal fusion to Gtf2. Only the C- terminal fusion of GST and HSV were able to be identified in S. parasanguinis. The Nano tag was not detected in either E. coli or S. parasanguinis. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged Gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the Gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the Nano-tagged Gtf2 at its N-terminal fusion. Using a T7-tagged Gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including S. mutans, S. pneumoniae and S. sanguinis. Therefore, the expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in Fap1 biogenesis in S. parasanguinis, but also to study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pVT1666 replicates.
TI  - Functional overlap but lack of complete cross-complementation of Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli YidC orthologs.
AB  - Oxa/YidC/Alb family proteins are chaperones involved in membrane protein insertion and assembly. Streptococcus mutans has two YidC paralogs. Elimination of yidC2, but not yidC1, results in stress sensitivity with decreased membrane-associated F(1)F(o) ATPase activity and an inability to initiate growth at low pH or high salt concentrations (A. Hasona, P. J. Crowley, C. M. Levesque, R. W. Mair, D. G. Cvitkovitch, A. S. Bleiweis, and L. J. Brady, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:17466-17471, 2005). We now show that Escherichia coli YidC complements for acid tolerance, and partially for salt tolerance, in S. mutans lacking yidC2 and that S. mutans YidC1 or YidC2 complements growth in liquid medium, restores the proton motive force, and functions to assemble the F(1)F(o) ATPase in a previously engineered E. coli YidC depletion strain (J. C. Samuelson, M. Chen, F. Jiang, I. Moller, M. Wiedmann, A. Kuhn, G. J. Phillips, and R. E. Dalbey, Nature 406:637-641, 2000). Both YidC1 and YidC2 also promote membrane insertion of known YidC substrates in E. coli; however, complete membrane integrity is not fully replicated, as evidenced by induction of phage shock protein A. While both function to rescue E. coli growth in broth, a different result is observed on agar plates: growth of the YidC depletion strain is largely restored by 247YidC2, a hybrid S. mutans YidC2 fused to the YidC targeting region, but not by a similar chimera, 247YidC1, nor by YidC1 or YidC2. Simultaneous expression of YidC1 and YidC2 improves complementation on plates. This study demonstrates functional redundancy between YidC orthologs in gram-negative and gram-positive organisms but also highlights differences in their activity depending on growth conditions and species background, suggesting that the complete functional spectrum of each is optimized for the specific bacteria and environment in which they reside.
TI  - Glucosylation of acetic acid by sucrose phosphorylase.
AB  - Transglucosylation from sucrose to acetic acid by sucrose phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.7) was studied. 1-O-Acetyl-alpha-D-glucopyranose was isolated as the main product of the enzyme reaction. We also compared the pH-dependence of transglycosylation catalyzed by sucrose phosphorylase toward carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. With hydroquinone as an acceptor molecule, the transfer ratio of glucose residue was higher at neutral pH. This pH-activity profile was similar to that of the phosphorolysis of sucrose by sucrose phosphorylase, but with acetic acid as an acceptor molecule, the transfer ratio of glucose residue was higher at low pH. These findings suggest that the undissociated carboxyl group is essential to the acceptor molecule for the transglycosylation reaction of sucrose phosphorylase. In a sensory test, the sour taste of acetic acid was markedly reduced by glucosylation. The threshold value of the sour taste of acetic acid glucosides was approximately 100 times greater than that of acetic acid.
TI  - Effects of antibodies against a fusion protein consisting of parts of cell surface protein antigen and glucosyltransferase of Streptococcus sobrinus on cell adhesion of mutans streptococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The cell surface protein antigen (PAg) and glucosyltransferases  (GTFs) produced by Streptococcus sobrinus are considered to be major colonization factors of the organism. METHODS: We constructed a fusion gene encoding a protein composed of the alanine-rich region of PAg (PAgA) and the glucan-binding domain (GB) of GTF-I, which catalyzes the synthesis of water-insoluble glucan in S. sobrinus. The fusion protein PAgA-GB was purified from cell extracts of Escherichia coli harboring the fusion gene, and antibodies against the fusion protein were prepared in rabbits. RESULTS: In the presence of sucrose, the antibody against PAgA-GB significantly inhibited the adhesion of both S. sobrinus MT8145 and Streptococcus mutans Xc to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads, and the inhibitory effect on S. sobrinus was stronger than that on S. mutans. In the absence of sucrose, the antibody against PAgA-GB significantly inhibited the adhesion of both S. sobrinus and S. mutans, however the inhibitory effect on S. sobrinus was unexpectedly weaker than that on S. mutans. A similar result was observed with the antibody against the intact recombinant PAg protein (rPAg), while the same antibody reacted more strongly against S. sobrinus than against S. mutans cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results show that the antibody against S. sobrinus GTF-I may be useful for effective inhibition of the sucrose-dependent adhesion of S. sobrinus. However, PAg of S. sobrinus may not function primarily as a receptor for acquired pellicles, and other cell surface proteins may be involved in the sucrose-independent adhesion of S. sobrinus.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis sample were used. The storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPRT). Refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPR). To perform the immediate effect analysis (GPi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although GPR, iodoform, Rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees C average temperature. The testing methodology was Dilution in Solid Medium-Agar. The Wilcoxon Test and Friedman variance analyses were used. RESULTS: The GP paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. CONCLUSION: The pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.
TI  - Preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of SMU.573, a putative sugar kinase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - SMU.573 from Streptococcus mutans is a structurally and functionally uncharacterized protein that was selected for structural biology studies. Native and SeMet-labelled proteins were expressed with an N-His tag in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni2+-chelating and size-exclusion chromatography. Crystals of the SeMet-labelled protein were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method and a 2.5 A resolution diffraction data set was collected using an in-house chromium radiation source. The crystals belong to space group I4, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 96.53, c = 56.26 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficiency of a mouthwash containing triclosan/gantrez and sodium bicarbonate.
AB  - Several antiseptic substances have been used as adjuncts to routine mechanical procedures of oral hygiene, based on their antimicrobial effects. The objective of this study was to assess in vitro the antimicrobial efficiency of a mouthwash containing Triclosan/Gantrez and sodium bicarbonate in comparison to both positive and negative controls. Standard strain samples of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Actinomyces viscosus and Bacillus subtilis were used. Samples of Streptococcus mutans and Gram-negative bacilli were collected from 20 volunteers (10 with a clinically healthy periodontium and 10 presenting biofilm-associated gingivitis). Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity was performed by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The results indicated that the test solution inhibited the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms from the volunteers saliva as well as that of the standard strains at the MIC dilution of 1:20, whereas the MIC dilution of 0.12% chlorhexidine against the same bacteria was 1:80. Thus, even though the tested mouthrinse solution presented an in-vitro antimicrobial activity superior to that of a placebo, it was inferior to that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Factors affecting antimicrobial activity of MUC7 12-mer, a human salivary mucin-derived peptide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: MUC7 12-mer (RKSYKCLHKRCR), a cationic antimicrobial peptide derived  from the human low-molecular-weight salivary mucin MUC7, possesses potent antimicrobial activity in vitro. In order to evaluate the potential therapeutic application of the MUC7 12-mer, we examined the effects of mono- and divalent cations, EDTA, pH, and temperature on its antimicrobial activity. METHODS: Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined using a liquid growth inhibition assay in 96-well microtiter plates. MUC7 12-mer was added at concentrations of 1.56-50 microM. MICs were determined at three endpoints: MIC-0, MIC-1, and MIC-2 (the lowest drug concentration showing 10%, 25% and 50% of growth, respectively). To examine the effect of salts or EDTA, a checkerboard microdilution technique was used. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICi) was calculated on the basis of MIC-0. The viability of microbial cells treated with MUC7 12-mer in the presence of sodium or potassium was also determined by killing assay or flow cytometry. RESULTS: The MICs of MUC7 12-mer against organisms tested ranged from 6.25-50 microM. For C. albicans, antagonism (FICi 4.5) was observed for the combination of MUC7 12-mer and calcium; however, there was synergism (FICi 0.22) between MUC7 12-mer and EDTA, and the synergism was retained in the presence of calcium at its physiological concentration (1-2 mM). No antagonism but additivity or indifference (FICi 0.55-2.5) was observed for the combination of MUC7 12-mer and each K+, Na+, Mg2+, or Zn2+. MUC7 12-mer peptide (at 25 microM) also exerted killing activity in the presence of NaCl, (up to 25 mM for C. albicans and up to 150 mM for E. coli, a physiological concentration of sodium in the oral cavity and serum, respectively) and retained candidacidal activity in the presence of KCl (up to 40 mM). The peptide exhibited higher inhibitory activity against C. albicans at pH 7, 8, and 9 than at pH 5 and 6, and temperature up to 60 degrees C did not affect the activity. CONCLUSION: MUC7 12-mer peptide is effective anticandidal agent at physiological concentrations of variety of ions in the oral cavity. These results suggest that, especially in combination with EDTA, it could potentially be applied as an alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of human oral candidiasis.
TI  - Preparation, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of threonine synthase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The thrC gene of Streptococcus mutans encodes threonine synthase, which is a potential target for drug design. To study the structure and function of the enzyme, the thrC gene was amplified from Streptococcus mutans genomic DNA and cloned into the expression vector pET28alpha. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli in soluble form and purified to homogeneity. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The crystal diffracted to 2.5 A and belonged to space group P3(1) or P3(2), with unit cell parameters a=b=60.39 A, c=118.62 A.
TI  - Two closely related ABC transporters in Streptococcus mutans are involved in disaccharide and/or oligosaccharide uptake.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans has a large number of transporters apparently involved in the uptake of carbohydrates. At least two of these, the multiple sugar metabolism transporter, MsmEFGK, and the previously uncharacterized MalXFGK, are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Mutation analysis revealed that the MsmEFGK and MalXFGK transporters are principally involved in the uptake of distinct disaccharides and/or oligosaccharides. Furthermore, the data also indicated an unusual protein interaction between the components of these two related transporters. Strains lacking msmE (which encodes a solute binding protein) can no longer utilize raffinose or stachyose but grow normally on maltodextrins in the absence of MalT, a previously characterized EII(mal) phosphotransferase system component. In contrast, a mutant of malX (which encodes a solute binding protein) cannot utilize maltodextrins but grows normally on raffinose or stachyose. Radioactive uptake assays confirmed that MalX, but not MsmE, is required for uptake of [U-14C]maltotriose and that MalXFGK is principally involved in the uptake of maltodextrins with as many as 7 glucose units. Surprisingly, inactivation of the corresponding ATPase components did not result in an equivalent abolition of growth: the malK mutant can grow on maltotetraose as a sole carbon source, and the msmK mutant can utilize raffinose. We propose that the ATPase domains of these ABC transporters can interact with either their own or the alternative transporter complex. Such unexpected interaction of ATPase subunits with distinct membrane components to form complete multiple ABC transporters may be widespread in bacteria.
TI  - Role of RelA of Streptococcus mutans in global control of gene expression.
AB  - The production of (p)ppGpp by Streptococcus mutans UA159 is catalyzed by three gene products: RelA, RelP, and RelQ. Here, we investigate the role of the RelA (Rel) homologue of S. mutans in the stringent response and in the global control of gene expression. RelA of S. mutans was shown to synthesize pppGpp in vitro from GTP and ATP in the absence of added ribosomes, as well as in vivo in an Escherichia coli relA-spoT mutant. Mupirocin (MUP) was shown to induce high levels of (p)ppGpp production in S. mutans in a relA-dependent manner, with a concomitant reduction in GTP pools. Transcription profiling after MUP treatment of S. mutans revealed that 104 genes were upregulated and 130 were downregulated (P < or = 0.001); mainly, genes for macromolecular biosynthesis, translation, and energy metabolism were downregulated. When a derivative of UA159 carrying a complete deletion of the relA gene was treated with MUP, 72 genes were upregulated and 52 were downregulated (P < or = 0.001). The expression of 50 genes (P < or = 0.001) was commonly affected by MUP treatment in the two strains, suggesting that S. mutans can mount a relA-independent response to MUP. Consistent with the gene expression profiling, RelA was shown to play major roles in the regulation of phenotypic traits that are required for establishment, persistence, and virulence expression by this oral pathogen. Thus, RelA is the major (p)ppGpp synthase controlling the stringent response in S. mutans, and it coordinates the expression of genes and phenotypes that contribute to the pathogenic potential of the organism.
TI  - Nitrite reductase in Streptoccocus mutans plays a critical role in the survival of this pathogen in oral cavity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The mechanisms of nitric oxide (NO) production by bacteria in the oral cavity are still not clearly defined but salivary streptococci have been reported to generate NO. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of nitrite metabolism and generation of NO by Streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen of dental caries. METHODS: We searched the genomic database of oral pathogens for nitrite reductase and used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to clone the nirJ gene from S. mutans GS5. His-tagged recombinant NirJ protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and characterized. We constructed a nirJ gene-disrupted mutant strain of S. mutans (DeltanirJ) to analyze the physiological significance of nirJ. RESULTS: S. mutans generates NO from nitrite, probably as a result of the possession of nitrite reductase. We cloned the nirJ gene from S. mutans GS5 by PCR. The recombinant NirJ protein catalyzed the reduction of nitrite with a K(m) value of 3.37 microM and a specific activity of 2.5 micromol/min/mg of protein at 37 degrees C. Biochemical analysis revealed that the nitrite-reducing activity of the mutant (DeltanirJ) strain was significantly lower than that of the wild-type strain. The growth of the mutant strain, but not of the wild-type strain, was strongly suppressed by the presence of physiological levels of nitrite ( approximately 0.2 mM) in saliva. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that the elimination of nitrite and/or the generation of NO are important for the survival of S. mutans in the oral cavity.
TI  - Protein preparation, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of SMU.961 protein from the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The smu.961 gene encodes a putative protein of 183 residues in Streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen in human dental caries. The gene was cloned into expression vector pET28a and expressed in a substantial quantity in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) with a His tag at its N-terminus. The recombinant protein SMU.961 was purified to homogeneity in a two-step procedure consisting of Ni2+-chelating and size-exclusion chromatography. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to 2.9 A resolution at beamline I911-3, MAX-II-lab, Sweden. The crystal belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 98.62, b = 73.73, c = 184.73 A, beta = 98.82 degrees.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of membrane structure and function in many groups of anaerobic bacteria. Like Escherichia coli, the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids. In E. coli UFA synthesis requires the action of two gene products, the essential isomerase/dehydratase encoded by fabA and an elongation condensing enzyme encoded by fabB. S. pneumoniae lacks both genes and instead employs a single enzyme with only an isomerase function encoded by the fabM gene. In this paper we report the construction and characterization of an S. pneumoniae 708 fabM mutant. This mutant failed to grow in complex medium, and the defect was overcome by addition of UFAs to the growth medium. S. pneumoniae fabM mutants did not produce detectable levels of monounsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis of the radiolabeled phospholipids. We also demonstrate that a fabM null mutant of the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutants is a UFA auxotroph, indicating that FabM is the only enzyme involved in the control of membrane fluidity in streptococci. Finally we report that the fabN gene of Enterococcus faecalis, coding for a dehydratase/isomerase, complements the growth of S. pneumoniae fabM mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that FabM is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents against streptococci and that S. pneumoniae UFA auxotrophs could help identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in UFA biosynthesis.
TI  - Activity of an antimicrobial peptide mimetic against planktonic and biofilm cultures of oral pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have recently been examined for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics. Unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. To address this problem, we have examined the activity of a peptide mimetic whose design was based on the structure of magainin, exhibiting its amphiphilic structure. We demonstrate that this compound, meta-phenylene ethynylene (mPE), exhibits antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations against a variety of bacterial and Candida species found in oral infections. Since Streptococcus mutans, an etiological agent of dental caries, colonizes the tooth surface and forms a biofilm, we quantified the activity of this compound against S. mutans growing under conditions that favor biofilm formation. Our results indicate that mPE can prevent the formation of a biofilm at nanomolar concentrations. Incubation with 5 nM mPE prevents further growth of the biofilm, and 100 nM mPE reduces viable bacteria in the biofilm by 3 logs. Structure-function analyses suggest that mPE inhibits the bioactivity of lipopolysaccharide and binds DNA at equimolar ratios, suggesting that it may act both as a membrane-active molecule, similar to magainin, and as an intracellular antibiotic, similar to other AMPs. We conclude that mPE and similar molecules display great potential for development as therapeutic antimicrobials.
TI  - Protein preparation and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of a putative glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase from Streptococcus mutants.
AB  - The SMU.636 protein from Streptococcus mutans is a putative glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase with 233 residues. The smu.636 gene was PCR-amplified from S. mutans genomic DNA and cloned into the expression vector pET-28a(+). The resultant His-tagged fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity in two steps. Crystals of the fusion protein were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to 2.4 A resolution and belong to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 53.83, b = 82.13, c = 134.70 A.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of D-alanine-D-alanine  ligase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - D-Alanine-D-alanine ligase is encoded by the gene ddl (SMU_599) in Streptococcus  mutans. This ligase plays a very important role in cell-wall biosynthesis and may be a potential target for drug design. To study the structure and function of this ligase, the gene ddl was amplified from S. mutans genomic DNA and cloned into the expression vector pET28a. The protein was expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Homogeneous protein was obtained using a two-step procedure consisting of Ni2+-chelating and size-exclusion chromatography. Purified protein was crystallized and the cube-shaped crystal diffracted to 2.4 A. The crystal belongs to space group P3(1)21 or P3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 79.50, c = 108.97 A. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit.
TI  - Three gene products govern (p)ppGpp production by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The current dogma implicating RelA as the sole enzyme controlling (p)ppGpp production and degradation in Gram-positive bacteria does not apply to Streptococcus mutans. We have now identified and characterized two genes, designated as relP and relQ, encoding novel enzymes that are directly involved in (p)ppGpp synthesis. Additionally, relP is co-transcribed with a two-component signal transduction system (TCS). Analysis of the (p)ppGpp synthetic capacity of various mutants and the behaviour of strains lacking combinations of the synthetase enzymes have revealed a complex regulon and fundamental differences in the way S. mutans manages alarmone production compared with bacterial paradigms. The functionality of the RelP and RelQ enzymes was further confirmed by demonstrating that expression of relP and relQ restored growth of a (p)ppGpp(0) Escherichia coli strain in minimal medium, SMG and on medium containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and by demonstrating (p)ppGpp production in various complemented mutant strains of E. coli and S. mutans. Notably, RelQ, and RelP and the associated TCS, are harboured in some, but not all, pathogenic streptococci and related Gram-positive organisms, opening a new avenue to explore the variety of strategies employed by human and animal pathogens to survive in adverse conditions that are peculiar to environments in their hosts.
TI  - One of two gbpC gene homologues is involved in dextran-dependent aggregation of Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus sobrinus exhibits marked dextran-dependent aggregation mediated by glucan-binding proteins (GBPs). In contrast to Streptococcus mutans, in which the gbpC gene responsible for dextran-dependent aggregation of this organism has been characterized, genes encoding the S. sobrinus GBPs have not yet been identified. METHODS: Recently, we identified the gbpC gene homologue from Streptococcus macacae using polymerase chain reaction primers based on the conserved regions of the gbpC sequence exhibiting intraspecies variations. This method was applied to amplify a S. sobrinus homologue. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, two gbpC gene homologues were identified in S. sobrinus strain 100-4. One homologue, named gbpC, was more similar to the S. mutans gbpC gene than the other and was approximately half the molecular size of its homologue with similar regions interrupted by several non-similar stretches. However, the dextran-binding activity of the protein expressed from gbpC in Escherichia coli was not detected in contrast to the other homologue, a protein designated as Dbl, expressing this activity. The gbpC gene was shown to be intact on the chromosome of strain OMZ176, which does not exhibit dextran-dependent aggregation, while the dbl gene of this strain contained a single adenine nucleotide insertion at approximately one-third the distance from the 5'-end. The insertion mutation in the dbl gene resulted in translation of a premature protein missing its LPXTG sequence signature sequence of the wall-anchored proteins. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the dbl gene is very likely responsible for S. sobrinus dextran-dependent aggregation.
TI  - Interaction of salivary alpha-amylase and amylase-binding-protein A (AbpA) of Streptococcus gordonii with glucosyltransferase of S. gordonii and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucosyltransferases (Gtfs), enzymes that produce extracellular glucans from dietary sucrose, contribute to dental plaque formation by Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans. The alpha-amylase-binding protein A (AbpA) of S. gordonii, an early colonizing bacterium in dental plaque, interacts with salivary amylase and may influence dental plaque formation by this organism. We examined the interaction of amylase and recombinant AbpA (rAbpA), together with Gtfs of S. gordonii and S. mutans. RESULTS: The addition of salivary alpha-amylase to culture supernatants of S. gordonii precipitated a protein complex containing amylase, AbpA, amylase-binding protein B (AbpB), and the glucosyltransferase produced by S. gordonii (Gtf-G). rAbpA was expressed from an inducible plasmid, purified from Escherichia coli and characterized. Purified rAbpA, along with purified amylase, interacted with and precipitated Gtfs from culture supernatants of both S. gordonii and S. mutans. The presence of amylase and/or rAbpA increased both the sucrase and transferase component activities of S. mutans Gtf-B. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using anti-Gtf-B antibody verified the interaction of rAbpA and amylase with Gtf-B. A S. gordonii abpA-deficient mutant showed greater biofilm growth under static conditions than wild-type in the presence of sucrose. Interestingly, biofilm formation by every strain was inhibited in the presence of saliva. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that an extracellular protein network of AbpA-amylase-Gtf may influence the ecology of oral biofilms, likely during initial phases of colonization.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of SMU.134 protein from caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The smu.134 gene encodes a putative transcriptional regulator of 217 residues in  Streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen for human dental caries. The gene was cloned into expression vector pET28alpha and expressed in soluble form in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) with a His tag at its N-terminus. The recombinant protein SMU.134 was purified to homogeneity in a two step procedure of Ni(2+ ) chelating and size exclusion chromatography. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method and diffracted to 2.6 A;. The crystal belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=55.03 A, b=80.84 A, c=107.96 A.
TI  - Periodontal bacterial DNA suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  - Certain CpG motifs found in bacterial DNA enhance immune responses through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. Our objective was to determine if DNA from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral cavity. Streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (GTF), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. Rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-GTF, or alum-GTF together with either Escherichia coli DNA, Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA, or Porphyromonas gingivalis DNA. Contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-GTF plus bacterial DNA (P. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, salivary IgA antibody, and T-cell proliferation to GTF compared to animals immunized with alum-GTF alone. A diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-GTF with the P. gingivalis DNA either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and DNA was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. Since TLR triggering by DNA induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [SOCS]), the effects of P. gingivalis DNA and GTF exposure on rat splenocyte production of SOCS family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. P. gingivalis DNA significantly up-regulated SOCS1 and SOCS5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. These results suggested that DNA from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive SOCS components triggered by innate mechanisms.
TI  - In vitro reconstitution of antimicrobial pathogen activity by expressed recombinant bovine lactoferrin N-terminal peptide in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recombinant bovine lactoferrin N-terminal polypeptide (rbLF-N) Escherichia coli expression system was constructed and the rbLF-N antimicrobial activity was displayed by enzymatic proteolysis in this study. A 162 bp 5'-terminal fragment of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) gene from bovine liver gDNA was amplified by PCR. The DNA fragment containing exon-2 of the bLF gene was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-4T1 and the glutathione-S-transferase-rbLF-N (GST-rbLF-N) fusion protein was obtained by over-expression in Esch. coli BL21(DE3). After thrombin/pepsin digestion, the rbLF-N was released from the fusion protein. The recombinant peptide was separated and identified by SDS-PAGE, HPLC and LC-MS/MS analysis. A very strong anti-food-born microbial pathogen activity of the rbLF-N peptides was displayed through bio- and kinetic-assays in vitro. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the rbLF-N peptide for bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Esch. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 11.7, 11.7, 11.7, 23.4 microg and 23.4, 11.7, 11.7, 46.4 microg, respectively. This study created a new route for exploring lactoferrin peptide application in food science.
TI  - Overlapping substrate specificity for sucrose and maltose of two binding protein-dependent sugar uptake systems in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Sugar metabolism by Streptococcus mutans is associated with tooth decay. The most abundant sugars in the human diet are sucrose and maltose, a derivative of starch. Previously, we reported a binding protein-dependent transport system (msm) in S. mutans that transports sucrose and maltose, but its associated enzymes do not metabolize maltose. By searching the S. mutans genomic sequence for a maltose system (mal), we found a gene cluster encoding proteins with homology to those of msm and the Escherichia coli maltose system. Mutants were constructed by deleting msm or mal, or both, and tested for sugar utilization. Deletion of the mal system diminished the ability of S. mutans to ferment maltose, but deletion of only the mal transporter genes or msm showed reduced utilization of chromogenic maltosides. Maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, mannose, and N-acetyl glucosamine inhibited utilization of chromogenic maltosides by the wild-type strain and mutants. In conclusion, the two binding protein-dependent systems in S. mutans appear to transport collaboratively their common substrate sugars, notably sucrose and maltose.
TI  - Mutants of type II heat-labile enterotoxin LT-IIa with altered ganglioside-binding activities and diminished toxicity are potent mucosal adjuvants.
AB  - The structure and function LT-IIa, a type II heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli, are closely related to the structures and functions of cholera toxin and LT-I, the type I heat-labile enterotoxins of Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, respectively. While LT-IIa is a potent systemic and mucosal adjuvant, recent studies demonstrated that mutant LT-IIa(T34I), which exhibits no detectable binding activity as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with gangliosides GD1b, GD1a, and GM1 is a very poor adjuvant. To evaluate whether other mutant LT-IIa enterotoxins that also exhibit diminished ganglioside-binding activities have greater adjuvant activities, BALB/c mice were immunized by the intranasal route with the surface adhesin protein AgI/II of Streptococcus mutans alone or in combination with LT-IIa, LT-IIa(T14S), LT-IIa(T14I), or LT-IIa(T14D). All three mutant enterotoxins potentiated strong mucosal immune responses that were equivalent to the response promulgated by wt LT-IIa. All three mutant enterotoxins augmented the systemic immune responses that correlated with their ganglioside-binding activities. Only LT-IIa and LT-IIa(T14S), however, enhanced expression of major histocompatibility complex class II and the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 on splenic dendritic cells. LT-IIa(T14I) and LT-IIa(T14D) had extremely diminished toxicities in a mouse Y1 adrenal cell bioassay and reduced abilities to induce the accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP in a macrophage cell line.
TI  - Functional characterization and Me ion specificity of a Ca-citrate transporter from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Secondary transporters of the bacterial CitMHS family transport citrate in complex with a metal ion. Different members of the family are specific for the metal ion in the complex and have been shown to transport Mg(2+)-citrate, Ca(2+)-citrate or Fe(3+)-citrate. The Fe(3+)-citrate transporter of Streptococcus mutans clusters on the phylogenetic tree on a separate branch with a group of transporters found in the phylum Firmicutes which are believed to be involved in anaerobic citrate degradation. We have cloned and characterized the transporter from Enterococcus faecalis EfCitH in this cluster. The gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and studied using right-side-out membrane vesicles. The transporter catalyzes proton-motive-force-driven uptake of the Ca(2+)-citrate complex with an affinity constant of 3.5 microm. Homologous exchange is catalyzed with a higher efficiency than efflux down a concentration gradient. Analysis of the metal ion specificity of EfCitH activity in right-side-out membrane vesicles revealed a specificity that was highly similar to that of the Bacillus subtilis Ca(2+)-citrate transporter in the same family. In spite of the high sequence identity with the S. mutans Fe(3+)-citrate transporter, no transport activity with Fe(3+) (or Fe(2+)) could be detected. The transporter of E. faecalis catalyzes translocation of citrate in complex with Ca(2+), Sr(2+), Mn(2+), Cd(2+) and Pb(2+) and not with Mg(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Co(2+). The specificity appears to correlate with the size of the metal ion in the complex.
TI  - Preparation, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the methionine synthase (MetE) from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans metE gene encodes methionine synthase (MetE), which catalyzes the direct transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine in the last step of methionine synthesis. metE was cloned into pET28a and the gene product was expressed at high levels in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). MetE was purified to homogeneity using Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Crystals of the protein were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to 2.2 A resolution. The crystal belongs to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 52.85, b = 99.48, c = 77.88 A, beta = 94.55 degrees .
TI  - Association between the presence of bacterial 16S RNA in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (Sweden).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study bacterial 16S RNA in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial DNA was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n = 171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). METHODS: 16S DNA PCR followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. RESULTS: In 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16S RNA were detected. Sequence analysis revealed Propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16S RNA positive patients). The second most frequent isolate-Escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. The other isolates included Pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), Actinomyces sp. (2), Streptococcus mutans (1), Corynebacterium sp. (2), Nocardioides sp. (1), Rhodococcus sp. (1) Veillonella sp. (2). In P. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602). The presence of P. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.77-6.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed P. acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in BPH. Further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.
TI  - In vitro anti-microbial and in vivo cytokine modulating effects of different prepared Chinese herbal medicines.
AB  - The toxicity, antimicrobial and cytokine modulating effects of herbal medicines in treating periodontal diseases were evaluated in this study. Using the broth dilution method and disc agar diffusion test, in individual and combined decocted preparations, different concentrations of Ching-Wei-San and its individual herbal components, Coptidis rhizoma, Angelicae sinensis radix, Rehmanniae radixet rhizom, Moutan radicis cortex, and Cimicifuga foetida, were tested for in vitro inhibitory effects on three well-known plaque-causing bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivialis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mutans, and two common pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The cytokine modulating effects were evaluated in Balb/c mice. The results suggested that one milliliter Ching-Wei-San at the 25,000 mg/mL concentration daily for the mice had significantly high levels in the liver function indexes in the 3-day acute toxicity test and in both the liver and kidney function indexes in the 28-day subacute toxicity test (P<0.01). The 250 mg/mL Ching-Wei-San is comparable to 250 mg/mL of tetracycline, and had similar inhibitory effects on the tested bacteria. Coptidis rhizoma (62.5 mg/mL) was the only individual herbal component to show 100% inhibitory effects. The mean cytokine ratios of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in Balb/c mice treated with individual herbal components were shown to be different from each other. Ching-Wei-San modulated the immunity of mice, up-regulated IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-alpha, but down-regulated IFN-gamma. The effects of none of the individual herbal components alone can substitute for the cumulative effect of Ching-Wei-San.
TI  - In vitro studies of the digestion of caprine whey proteins by human gastric and duodenal juice and the effects on selected microorganisms.
AB  - The in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (HGJ) at pH 2.5 and human duodenal juice (HDJ) at pH 7.5. Different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (HGJ) and second (HDJ) enzymatic degradation. The minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and Ig were rapidly degraded by HGJ, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. Further digestion with HDJ still showed intact beta-LG, and the main part of alpha-LA also remained unchanged. The protein degradation by HGJ and HDJ was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at pH 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at pH 7.5. The two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. The digests after treatment with HGJ and HDJ were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Streptococcus mutans. Active growing cells of E. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with HGJ and HDJ. Cells of B. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with HGJ, while the products after further degradation with HDJ demonstrated no significant effect. Screenings performed on cells of Lb. rhamnosus GG and S. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.
TI  - Design of a peptibody consisting of the antimicrobial peptide dhvar5 and a llama  variable heavy-chain antibody fragment.
AB  - Immunoconjugates have been widely studied as potential therapeutics for infectious diseases to direct unspecific antimicrobials to pathogens. In this study, the recombinant approach was used for expression of the immunoconjugate composed of the variable domain of a llama heavy-chain antibody (VHH) against Streptococcus mutans and dhvar5, a synthetic antimicrobial peptide. Before cloning, the impact of the elongation of the peptide termini on its biological activity was evaluated by chemical synthesis of the N- or C-termini extended dhvar5 peptides. As the elongation of the C-terminus had a greater influence on decline of the antimicrobial activity, the N-terminal fusion was designed. To promote in vivo release of the active peptide, a factor Xa cleavage site was inserted between VHH and dhvar5. Propagation of transformed Escherichia coli with the constructed plasmid was only possible in the absence of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Although these data demonstrate that the diminished antimicrobial activity of dhvar5 by the N-terminal fusion to VHH was not sufficient for the protection of the bacterial host cells against the peptide lethal effect, an insight into propeptides biological activities may be beneficial not only for new and more successful rearrangement of the VHH-dhvar5 immunoconjugate construct, but also design of the other recombinant molecules composed of peptides toxic to host cells.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of RafE, a sugar-binding lipoprotein from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae contains a large number of sugar-transport systems and the system responsible for raffinose uptake has recently been identified. The substrate-binding protein component of this system shares strong sequence homology with the multiple sugar metabolism substrate-binding protein MsmE from S. mutans and contains a lipoprotein-attachment site at cysteine residue 23. A truncated form (residues 24-419) of RafE from S. pneumoniae was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Native and selenomethionine-labelled protein have been crystallized in the hexagonal space group P6(1)22. Diffraction data have been successfully phased to 2.90 angstroms using Se SAD data and model building is in progress.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Substance P and Neuropeptide Y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  - Infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically Substance P and Neuropeptide Y. Since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. Neuropeptide Y and Substance P had antimicrobial activity against E. coli (MIC 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml SEM and 71.5+/-15 SEM microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (MIC>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (MIC>500 microg/ml). While Substance P and Neuropeptide Y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. However, this remains to be determined.
TI  - Microchip-based one step DNA extraction and real-time PCR in one chamber for rapid pathogen identification.
AB  - Optimal detection of a pathogen present in biological samples depends on the ability to extract DNA molecules rapidly and efficiently. In this paper, we report a novel method for efficient DNA extraction and subsequent real-time detection in a single microchip by combining laser irradiation and magnetic beads. By using a 808 nm laser and carboxyl-terminated magnetic beads, we demonstrate that a single pulse of 40 seconds lysed pathogens including E. coli and Gram-positive bacterial cells as well as the hepatitis B virus mixed with human serum. We further demonstrate that the real-time pathogen detection was performed with pre-mixed PCR reagents in a real-time PCR machine using the same microchip, after laser irradiation in a hand-held device equipped with a small laser diode. These results suggest that the new sample preparation method is well suited to be integrated into lab-on-a-chip application of the pathogen detection system.
TI  - Production of Fab fragment corresponding to surface protein antigen of Streptococcus mutans serotype c-derived peptide by Escherichia coli and cultured tobacco cells.
AB  - The cDNA of a mouse Fab fragment was cloned from a hybridoma cell line that produces a mouse monoclonal antibody, KH5, that reacts with the peptide fragment of the surface protein antigen of Streptococcus mutans serotype c (PAc). After transfection with cDNA, recombinant Fab fragments were produced by Escherichia coli (T15 Fab) and cultured tobacco cells (X253 and X262 Fabs). The antipeptide activities of T15 and X253 were similar to that of KH5. X253 was secreted into the culture media, which had a specific affinity for the PAc peptide.
TI  - Expression of a pertussis toxin S1 fragment by inducible promoters in oral Streptococcus and the induction of immune responses during oral colonization in mice.
AB  - Previous work aimed at developing a live oral vaccine expressing pertussis toxin  S1 fragment on the surface of the bacterium Streptococcus gordonii elicited a lower than expected antibody response, perhaps because of low antigen expression. In this study, in-frame promoter fusions were constructed to investigate whether an increase in antigen production by the streptococcal vaccine strain results in a better antibody response. The promoters tested were (i) the Streptococcus mutans sucrose-inducible fructosyltransferase (ftf) promoter and (ii) the Bacillus subtilis/Escherichia coli chimeric tetracycline-inducible xyl/tetO promoter. Each of these two promoters was placed upstream of the spaP/s1 fusion gene to drive its expression. The constructs were introduced into S. gordonii DL1 and S. mutans 834. The inducibility of the promoters was confirmed through the determination of SpaP/S1 production via Western blottings. Induced production of SpaP/S1 was observed in S. gordonii and S. mutans with each of the promoters, but the level of expression was the highest in S. mutans, using the xyl/tetO promoter. Thus, S. mutans carrying the xyl/tetO/spaP/s1 construct (S. mutans PM14) was used in oral colonization studies in BALB/c mice. Streptococccus mutans PM14 was able to colonize the animals for the 14-week duration of experimentation. A mucosal IgA response was observed in all the treatment groups but was highest in mice receiving tetracycline induction. In the mouse model of Bordetella pertussis respiratory infection, animals colonized with S. mutans PM14 showed a decreased in B. pertussis lung colony count (P = 0.03) on day 3 compared with control mice colonized by the parent S. mutans 834.
TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of Candida albicans biofilms.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro Candida albicans biofilm development. A single isolate of C. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species of oral bacteria comprising, Actinomyces israelii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. Biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of Candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. A viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. Co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on Candida biofilm formation. Co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (P<0.05), except for L. acidophilus, S. mutans, and, S. intermedius co-cultures. Further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration of either P. gingivalis or E. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (P<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. Taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate C. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.
TI  - Effect of MUC7 peptides on the growth of bacteria and on Streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the susceptibility of selected bacteria as well as Streptococcus mutans biofilm to MUC7 peptides and compare the activities with those of other known antimicrobial peptides. METHODS: MIC and MBC of peptides for S. mutans, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using the microdilution method. For S. mutans, the effects of the peptides on the kinetics of growth inhibition, time-killing, and on biofilm formation and reduction were also examined. For biofilm studies, polystyrene microtitre plates, Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) and hydroxylapatite (HA) discs, along with Crystal Violet and Alamar Blue dyes, and/or EM observations, were employed. RESULTS: S. mutans was the most susceptible to all peptides tested (MICs of 9.4-25.0 microM), compared with the other species (MICs of 3.1->100 microM). MUC7 peptides (except MUC7-12-mer-L4) exerted 2-fold higher activity against S. mutans than Hsn5-12-mer and magainin-II, and faster killing of S. mutans than Hsn5-12-mer. The MUC7 peptides also had an effect on S. mutans biofilm. On the polystyrene plates, they suppressed the biofilm formation, with MBIC(50) of 6.25-12.5 microM, and reduced the 1 day developed biofilm in a batch culture, with MBRC(50) of 25-50 microM. On the CBD pegs, the viabilities of the biofilm were suppressed by >95% in the presence of MUC7 peptides at 4x MIC (50 microM). One day developed biofilm viabilities were inhibited by 49-75%. On HA, the formation of biofilm (as observed by EM) was also considerably reduced. CONCLUSIONS: MUC7 peptides present somewhat preferential antimicrobial activity against S. mutans. They also have an effect on in vitro formation and reduction of the preformed S. mutans biofilm.
TI  - [Construction of Streptococcus mutans luxS gene allelic exchange plasmid].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is reported that Streptococcus mutans luxS gene may have an important role in the interspecies quorum sensing system. To construct the S. mutans luxS gene knockout mutant, this research aim to construct the luxS gene allelic exchange plasmid. METHODS: The upstream and downstream flank DNA fragments of S. mutans luxS gene (Xup, Xdn)and the E. coli kanamycin resistance gene (Kana) were enriched by pfu DNA polymerase with "nest PCR" methods. These fragments were ligated into pBluescript SK (+) Phagemids vector with double endonuclease reaction sequentially. RESULTS: With endonuclease reaction and DNA sequencing, it was proved that the objective plasmid, Xukd-pbsk, was constructed correctively and the kanamycin resistance gene could be expressed in vitro. CONCLUSION: The S. mutans luxS gene allelic exchange plasmid is constructed correctively in this research and can be used in the future research of S. mutans luxS gene knockout mutant.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of Arctium lappa as a phytotherapeutic agent used in intracanal dressings.
AB  - The discovery of natural biocomponents from plants with antibacterial activity on endodontic microbiota may lead to new therapies. This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of a phytotherapeutic agent prepared from an ethyl acetate fraction (AcOEt) extracted from Arctium lappa. This agent was compared with calcium hydroxide as an intracanal dressing. Twenty-seven maxillary canines were instrumented, sterilized and inoculated with a mixed bacterial suspension of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. The teeth were divided into three groups and their canals filled with: group 1, calcium hydroxide and propylene glycol; group 2, a paste containing AcOEt fraction of A. lappa and propylene glycol; group 3, propylene glycol (control). At 7, 14 and 30 days, three teeth from each group were opened and a paper point was placed in the root canal for 5 min. The paper points were transferred to Petri dishes with Brain Heart Infusion (BHI). The bacterial growth was classified. Mild bacterial growth was found in group 1 at all time intervals; in group 2 there was severe growth at 7 days, but no growth at 14 and 30 days. The phytotherapeutic agent extracted from an AcOEt fraction of A. lappa inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms in this study.
TI  - [Construction of a virulence-related gene library of Streptococcus mutans by suppression subtractive hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a suppression subtractive library of virulence-related genes from c serotype Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), and lay foundations for screening the virulent genes. METHODS: After being isolated from virulent and avirulent strain of S. mutans respectively, the intact and high-pure genomic DNA was digested with three appropriate four-base-cutting restriction endonueleases to produce fragments of optimal length. The digested DNA of the virulent strain ligated with adaptor was used as tester DNA, and that of the avirulent strain as driver DNA. Then the suppression subtractive hybridization was carried out, and the efficiency of ligation and subtraction detected respectively. The subtracted fragments were inserted into vector pCR2. 1 using T/A cloning kit, and transformed into E. coli TOP10F' competent cells. Those white colonies were selected to construct the suppression subtractive library. RESULTS: Alu I chosen from three restriction endonucleases was verified to be suitable for preparing restriction fragments from S. mutans genomic DNA. Through electrophoresis of Alu I -digested DNA, a smear ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 kb was observed. The ligation efficiency of tester DNA with adaptor was at least higher than 25 percent. The subtraction efficiency of suppression subtractive hybridization confirmed the success in enrichment of differential genes between virulent and avirulent strain of S. mutans. In the subtracted group, the appearance time of the 23S rRNA gene both in tester and driver DNA was later than that in the unsubtracted group by six cycles. It suggested that suppression subtractive hybridization happened indeed. After the subtracted fragments were cloned, 96 colonies were picked up for constructing the suppression subtractive library of virulence-related genes of S. mutans. CONCLUSION: Suppression subtractive hybridization allows rapid and easy construction of virulence-related gene library of S. mutans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of monocaprin: a monoglyceride with potential use as a denture disinfectant.
AB  - Monocaprin is a 1-monoglyceride of capric acid that has antimicrobial activity against enveloped viruses, certain bacteria, and the yeast Candida albicans. Solutions containing monocaprin were formulated and tested in vitro against a number of micro-organisms, including species found in the oral cavity and common pathogenic species. The antimicrobial activity of monocaprin was tested with strains growing on a surface as well as in the planktonic phase. Micro-organisms tested were: Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two sets of dilutions were prepared for each test strain; one to be inoculated with the micro-organism growing in the planktonic phase and the other with the same strain growing on a filter paper disk. Control solutions were also prepared to find out if any of the excipients were affecting the microbicidal effect of monocaprin. Test strains growing on the filter paper surface were less sensitive to monocaprin than the same strain growing in its planktonic phase. C. albicans was the micro-organism that was most sensitive to monocaprin, but S. mutans also showed appreciable sensitivity. The indication that monocaprin may have potential as a topical agent against Candida was tested in an open study of denture disinfection in 32 patients attending a geriatric daycare centre. A significant, but short-term, reduction in counts of Candida on the fitting surface of full dentures was observed.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus mutans strains lacking the MazEF and RelBE toxin-antitoxin modules.
AB  - Two pairs of genes were identified in Streptococcus mutans with similarity to relBE and mazEF toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules of Escherichia coli. Transcription of mazEF and relBE was repressed by amino acid starvation, and relBE expression was repressed by low pH. Mutants lacking MazF, RelE, or both toxins (MRT1) grew in broth media and formed biofilms as well as the parent. Biofilm populations of MRT1 were more resistant to acid killing than the parent or single mutants. MRT1 also exhibited a longer diauxie during growth on glucose and inulin and displayed decreased phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase activity. This is the first report that demonstrates a physiological role for TA modules in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Differential immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine containing the Streptococcus mutans  wall-associated protein A gene versus that containing a truncated derivative antigen A lacking in the hydrophobic carboxyterminal region.
AB  - Two plasmid DNA constructs were obtained by cloning separately into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO the wall-associated protein A (wapA) gene of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 or its truncated derivative antigen A (agA) gene encoding a known candidate antigen for dental caries vaccine. The immunogenicity of the two constructs, designated pcDNA-wapA and pcDNA-agA, was compared by intranasal immunization of two groups of mice using the cationic DMRIE-C (1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethylhydroxy ethyl ammonium bromide-cholesterol) as an adjuvant. Immunization with pcDNA-wapA or pcDNA- agA resulted in specific salivary IgA and systemic IgG antibodies to the target antigens after two doses given at 3-week intervals. Higher salivary IgA level was observed in the mice immunized with the pcDNA-wapA vaccine compared to those immunized with the pcDNA-agA vaccine. Furthermore, anti-WapA antibody inhibited S. mutans sucrose-dependent adherence suggesting a potential protection against S. mutans colonization of the tooth, while anti-AgA had no significant effect. Indeed, prediction and analysis of protein epitopes showed that WapA contains highly promiscuous MHC-II binding motifs in addition to those found in AgA. Immunodot assay confirmed that WapA bound biotin-labeled dextran, whereas AgA did not. These data indicated that full-length WapA is a better candidate vaccine antigen than the soluble AgA, which is truncated in the hydrophobic membrane and wall-spanning region.
TI  - LuxS controls bacteriocin production in Streptococcus mutans through a novel regulatory component.
AB  - The oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans employs a variety of mechanisms to maintain a competitive advantage over many other oral bacteria which occupy the same ecological niche. Production of the bacteriocin, mutacin I, is one such mechanism. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms associated with mutacin I production. Previous work has demonstrated that the production of mutacin I greatly increased with cell density. In this study, we found that high cell density also triggered high level mutacin I gene transcription. However, this response was abolished upon deletion of luxS. Further analysis using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that in the luxS mutant transcription of both the mutacin I structural gene mutA and the mutacin I transcriptional activator mutR was impaired. Through microarray analysis, a putative transcription repressor annotated as Smu1274 in the Los Alamos National Laboratory Oral Pathogens Sequence Database was identified, which was strongly induced in the luxS mutant. Characterization of Smu1274, which we referred to as irvA, suggested that it may act as an inducible repressor to suppress mutacin I gene expression. A luxS and irvA double mutant regained the ability to produce mutacin I; whereas a constitutive irvA-producing strain was impaired in mutacin I production. These findings reveal a novel regulatory pathway for mutacin I gene expression, which may provide clues to the regulatory mechanisms of other cellular functions regulated by luxS in S. mutans.
TI  - Does mechanical pressure force bacteria into the dentinal tubules of carious and  non-carious teeth--an exploratory study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many researchers have confirmed bacterial migration within dentine, no evidence was found to show whether bacteria can be easily forced into dentine during caries treatment. OBJECTIVES: This exploratory study was to see if bacteria could be easily forced into dentinal tubules of carious and non-carious teeth using hand excavation and air pressure. METHODS: Two (2) carious and ten (10) non-carious teeth were used. Class I (Black's Classification) cavities were created using rotary instruments in the non-carious teeth, while the carious teeth were excavated using hand instruments to remove the caries. The cavity of one carious tooth was etched and in the other tooth was not. Five (5) of the non-carious tooth cavities were etched, of which, one tooth was also disinfected. The remaining five non-carious teeth were not etched and included one tooth that was disinfected. Bacterial cultures of S. mutans, E. coli and Veilonella were placed in the prepared cavities and hand excavators and air pressure were used in an attempt to force bacteria down into the dentinal tubules. Thereafter, the teeth were fixed, decalcified and prepared for electron or light microscopy. RESULTS: One etched, and one etched and disinfected non-carious tooth showed bacteria in the dentinal tubules. One carious tooth (etched) showed bacterial presence in the dentinal tubules. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is difficult to force bacteria into dentinal tubules using hand excavation (as in the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment technique) so a definitive study is not indicated.
TI  - Inducible antisense RNA expression in the characterization of gene functions in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - In order to examine gene function in Streptococcus mutans, we have recently initiated an antisense RNA strategy. Toward this end, we have now constructed and evaluated three Escherichia coli-S. mutans shuttle expression vectors with the fruA and scrB promoters from S. mutans, as well as the tetR-controlled tetO promoter from Staphylococcus aureus. Among these, the tetO/tetR system proved to be the most tightly controlled promoter. By using this shuttle plasmid system, modulation of gene function by inducible antisense RNA expression was demonstrated for comC antisense fragments of different sizes as well as for distinct gtfB antisense fragments. It was demonstrated that the size, but not the relative position, of an antisense DNA fragment is important in mediating the antisense phenomenon. Furthermore, by constructing and screening random DNA libraries with the tet expression shuttle system, 78 growth-retarded transformants harboring antisense DNA fragments were also identified. Almost all of them corresponded to homologous essential genes in other bacteria. In addition, a novel essential gene, the coaE gene, encoding dephospho-coenzyme A kinase, which is involved in the final step of coenzyme A catabolism in S. mutans, was identified and characterized. These results suggest that the antisense RNA strategy can be useful for identifying novel essential genes in S. mutans bacteria as well as further characterizing the physiology (including potential virulence factors) of these organisms.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - Smx nuclease is the major, low-pH-inducible apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The causative agent of dental caries in humans, Streptococcus mutans, outcompetes other bacterial species in the oral cavity and causes disease by surviving acidic conditions in dental plaque. We have previously reported that the low-pH survival strategy of S. mutans includes the ability to induce a DNA repair system that appears to involve an enzyme with exonuclease functions (K. Hahn, R. C. Faustoferri, and R. G. Quivey, Jr., Mol. Microbiol 31:1489-1498, 1999). Here, we report overexpression of the S. mutans apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, Smx, in Escherichia coli; initial characterization of its enzymatic activity; and analysis of an smx mutant strain of S. mutans. Insertional inactivation of the smx gene eliminates the low-pH-inducible exonuclease activity previously reported. In addition, loss of Smx activity renders the mutant strain sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment but relatively unaffected by acid-mediated damage or near-UV irradiation. The smx strain of S. mutans was highly sensitive to the combination of iron and hydrogen peroxide, indicating the likely production of hydroxyl radical by Fenton chemistry with concomitant formation of AP sites that are normally processed by the wild-type allele. Smx activity was sufficiently expressed in E. coli to protect an xth mutant strain from the effects of hydrogen peroxide treatment. The data indicate that S. mutans expresses an inducible, class II-like AP endonuclease, encoded by the smx gene, that exhibits exonucleolytic activity and is regulated as part of the acid-adaptive response of the organism. Smx is likely the primary, if not the sole, AP endonuclease induced during growth at low pH values.
TI  - New methods in the evaluation of chemical disinfectants used in health care services.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A considerable number of tests are recommended in the literature to evaluate in vitro commercial chemical solutions. The variety of tests reflects their limitations and the need to enhance disinfection process. METHODS: In this study the efficacy of 4 chemical disinfectants selected by their practical use in Health Care Services and by literature recommendation in aerobic and in strict anaerobic bacteria were evaluated by their practical use in Health Care Services and by literature recommendation in aerobic and in strict anaerobic bacteria. Viability was tested in biofilms grown on glass and rubber tip carriers. RESULTS: The results showed microbial growth in chemical solutions at concentrations recommended by the literature or at very close concentrations to them. Viable cells were recovered from biofilms after 30 minutes (Bacteroides fragilis) and 60 minutes (Streptococcus mutans and Salmonella tiphymurium) contact with 2.4% glutaraldehyde and after 60 minutes (S tiphymurium) in 2.0% glutaraldehyde. In 70% ethyl alcohol, S tiphymurium was viable up to 10 minutes, Escherichia coli up to 30 minutes, and S mutans up to 60 minutes. In 1% sodium hypochlorite, S mutans was viable up to 30 minutes and S tiphymurium up to 45 minutes. Detection of cell viability could be related to methodologic differences, including biofilm formation, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. It should be emphasized that B fragilis, the most clinically relevant obligate anaerobe, remained viable in one routinely used solution. CONCLUSION: These findings pointed out the need of periodic surveillance of disinfectants' activity used in Health Care Services and the need of reviewing routines of disinfection protocols.
TI  - Mucosal adjuvant properties of mutant LT-IIa and LT-IIb enterotoxins that exhibit altered ganglioside-binding activities.
AB  - LT-IIa and LT-IIb, the type II heat-labile enterotoxins of Escherichia coli, are  closely related in structure and function to cholera toxin and LT-I, the type I heat-labile enterotoxins of Vibrio cholerae and E. coli, respectively. Recent studies from our group demonstrated that LT-IIa and LT-IIb are potent systemic and mucosal adjuvants. To determine whether binding of LT-IIa and LT-IIb to their specific ganglioside receptors is essential for adjuvant activity, LT-IIa and LT-IIb enterotoxins were compared with their respective single-point substitution mutants which have no detectable binding activity for their major ganglioside receptors [e.g., LT-IIa(T34I) and LT-IIb(T13I)]. Both mutant enterotoxins exhibited an extremely low capacity for intoxicating mouse Y1 adrenal cells and for inducing production of cyclic AMP in a macrophage cell line. BALB/c female mice were immunized by the intranasal route with the surface adhesin protein AgI/II of Streptococcus mutans alone or in combination with LT-IIa, LT-IIa(T34I), LT-IIb, or LT-IIb(T13I). Both LT-IIa and LT-IIb potentiated strong mucosal and systemic immune responses against AgI/II. Of the two mutant enterotoxins, only LT-IIb(T13I) had the capacity to strongly potentiate mucosal anti-AgI/II and systemic anti-AgI/II antibody responses. Upon boosting with AgI/II, however, both LT-IIa(T34I) and LT-IIb(T13I) enhanced humoral memory responses to AgI/II. Flow cytometry demonstrated that LT-IIa(T34I) had no affinity for cervical lymph node lymphocytes. In contrast, LT-IIb(T13I) retained binding activity for T cells, B cells, and macrophages, indicating that this immunostimulatory mutant enterotoxin interacts with one or more unknown lymphoid cell receptors.
TI  - Production of functional ScFv inhibiting Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase activity from a hybridoma P126.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiologic agent of dental  caries in humans. The glucosyltransferase-I (GTF-I), which synthesized adhesive water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been demonstrated to be an important cariogenic property. Water-insoluble glucans (WIG) synthesized by S. mutans GTF-I can mediate sucrose-enhanced colonization on tooth surfaces and form dental plaque. It has been suggested that inhibition of WIG synthesis decreases bacterial colonization and cariogenicity. Indeed, the use of GTF enzymes as a vaccine antigen resulted in protection from experimental dental caries in rodents. However, it is preferable to eliminate unwanted immune response during active immunization of humans. To prevent this incidence, we attempted to produce the single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) antibody against GTF-I to develop passive immunization for dental caries. Hybridomas producing monoclonal antibody (MAb) that inhibited WIG synthesis by GTF-I have been constructed. Using mRNA from an IgG1 hybridoma P126, cDNAs encoding the variable fragments of the L and H chains of IgG1 from the hybridoma P126 were cloned by RT-PCR-based techniques and then transformed into an Escherichia coli expression system. The purified ScFv antibody recognized the recombinant (r) GTF-I proteins and was capable of inhibiting the WIG synthesis of rGTF-I.
TI  - Effect of carbohydrates on fructosyltransferase expression and distribution in Streptococcus mutans GS-5 biofilms.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans produces a fructosyltransferase (FTF) enzyme, which synthesizes fructan polymers from sucrose. Fructans contribute to the virulence of the biofilm by acting as binding sites for S. mutans adhesion and as extracellular nutrition reservoir for the oral bacteria. Antibodies raised against a recombinant S. mutans FTF were used to test the effect of glucose, fructose, and sucrose on FTF expression in S. mutans GS-5 biofilms. Biofilms formed in the presence of fructose and glucose showed a higher ratio of FTF compared to biofilms formed in the presence of sucrose. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of S. mutans biofilms indicated a carbohydrate-dependent FTF distribution. The layer adjacent to the surface and those at the liquid interface displayed high amounts cell-free FTF with limited amount of bacteria while the in-between layers demonstrated both cell-free FTF and cells expressing cell-surface FTF. Biofilm of S. mutans grown on hydroxyapatite surfaces expressed several FTF bands with molecular masses of 160, 125, 120, 100, and 50 kDa, as detected by using FTF specific antibodies. The results show that FTF expression and distribution in S. mutans GS-5 biofilms is carbohydrate regulated.
TI  - Bacterial defenses against oxidants: mechanistic features of cysteine-based peroxidases and their flavoprotein reductases.
AB  - Antioxidant defenses include a group of ubiquitous, non-heme peroxidases, designated the peroxiredoxins, which rely on an activated cysteine residue at their active site to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite. In the typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, a second cysteinyl residue, termed the resolving cysteine, is also involved in intersubunit disulfide bond formation during the course of catalysis by these enzymes. Many bacteria also express a flavoprotein, AhpF, which acts as a dedicated disulfide reductase to recycle the bacterial peroxiredoxin, AhpC, during catalysis. Mechanistic and structural studies of these bacterial proteins have shed light on the linkage between redox state, oligomeric state, and peroxidase activity for the peroxiredoxins, and on the conformational changes accompanying catalysis by both proteins. In addition, these studies have highlighted the dual roles that the oxidized cysteinyl species, cysteine sulfenic acid, can play in eukaryotic peroxiredoxins, acting as a catalytic intermediate in the peroxidase activity, and as a redox sensor in regulating hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell signaling.
TI  - Antibacterial and bioactive silver-containing Na2O x CaO x 2SiO2 glass prepared by sol-gel method.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of addition of silver oxide to Na2O x CaO x 2SiO2 glass  have been studied. Silver containing and silver free Na2O x CaO x 2SiO2 glasses have been prepared by sol-gel synthesis using tetramethil orthosilicate, sodium ethoxide, calcium nitrate tetrahydrate and silver nitrate as starting materials and methyl ethyl ketone as solvent. The gel was examined by differential thermal analysis, thermo gravimetric analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Antibacterial and bioactive tests on gel glass powders, obtained after a heat treatment of 2 h at 600 degrees C of the dried gel, were carried out. High antimicrobial effects of samples against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans were found. FTIR measurements and SEM micrographs have ascertained the formation of a hydroxyapatite layer on the surface of samples soaked in a simulated body fluid for different times.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of a fusion protein of llama heavy-chain antibodies coupled  to glucose oxidase on oral bacteria.
AB  - Enzymes such as lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase (GOx) are used as antimicrobial agents in oral care products. Their low specificities and substantiveness can be reduced by covalent coupling of antimicrobial molecules to antibodies. Variable domains (V(HH)) derived from llama heavy-chain antibodies are particularly suited for such an approach. The antibodies are composed solely of heavy-chain dimers; therefore, production of active fusion proteins by using molecular biology-based techniques is less complicated than production by use of conventional antibodies. In this study, a fusion protein consisting of V(HH) and GOx was constructed and expressed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A llama was immunized with Streptococcus mutans strain HG982. Subsequently, B lymphocytes were isolated and cDNA fragments encoding the V(HH) fragments were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. After construction of a V(HH) library in Escherichia coli and screening of the library against mutans group streptococci and Streptococcus sanguinis strains, we found two V(HH) fragments with high specificities for S. mutans strains. A GOx gene was linked to the two V(HH) genes and cloned into S. cerevisiae yeasts. The yeasts expressed and secreted the recombinant proteins into the growth medium. The test of binding of fusion proteins to oral bacteria through their V(HH) fragments showed that S. mutans had been specifically targeted by GOx-S120, one of the fusion protein constructs. A low concentration of the fusion protein was also able to selectively kill S. mutans within 20 min in the presence of lactoperoxidase and potassium iodide. These findings demonstrate that the fusion protein GOx-V(HH) is potentially valuable in the selective killing of target bacteria such as S. mutans.
TI  - Contribution of the alanine-rich region of Streptococcus mutans P1 to antigenicity, surface expression, and interaction with the proline-rich repeat domain.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is considered to be the major etiologic agent of human dental caries. Attachment of S. mutans to the tooth surface is required for the development of caries and is mediated, in part, by the 185-kDa surface protein variously known as antigen I/II, PAc, and P1. Such proteins are expressed by nearly all species of oral streptococci. Characteristics of P1 include an alanine-rich repeat region and a centrally located proline-rich repeat region. The proline-rich region of P1 has been shown to be important for the translational stability and translocation of P1 through the bacterial membrane. We show here that (i) several anti-P1 monoclonal antibodies require the simultaneous presence of the alanine-rich and proline-rich regions for binding, (ii) the proline-rich region of P1 interacts with the alanine-rich region, (iii) like the proline-rich region, the alanine-rich region is required for the stability and translocation of P1, (iv) both the proline-rich and alanine-rich regions are required for secretion of P1 in Escherichia coli, and (v) in E. coli, P1 is secreted in the absence of SecB.
TI  - Characterization of the Streptococcus mutans P1 epitope recognized by immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody 6-11A.
AB  - Monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6-11A directed against Streptococcus mutans surface adhesin P1 was shown previously to influence the mucosal immunogenicity of this organism in BALB/c mice. The specificity of anti-P1 serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory IgA antibodies and the subclass distribution of anti-P1 serum IgG antibodies were altered, and the ability of elicited serum antibodies to inhibit S. mutans adherence in vitro was in certain cases increased. MAb 6-11A is known to recognize an epitope dependent on the presence of the proline-rich region of the protein, although it does not bind directly to the isolated P-region domain. In this report, we show that MAb 6-11A recognizes a complex discontinuous epitope that requires the simultaneous presence of the alanine-rich repeat domain (A-region) and the P-region. Formation of the core epitope requires the interaction of these segments of P1. Residues amino terminal to the A-region also contributed to recognition by MAb 6-11A but were not essential for binding. Characterization of the MAb 6-11A epitope will enable insight into potential mechanisms of immunomodulation and broaden our understanding of the tertiary structure of P1.
TI  - The bifunctional peptidoglycan lysin of Streptococcus agalactiae bacteriophage B30.
AB  - A group B streptococcal (GBS) bacteriophage lysin gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme, calculated to have a molecular mass of 49 677 Da, lysed GBS cells. The susceptibility of GBS cells to lysis by the enzyme depended upon the growth stage at which they were harvested, with early exponential phase cells most sensitive. Calcium ions enhanced the activity of the enzyme. The enzyme also lysed other beta-haemolytic streptococci, including groups A, C, E and G streptococci, but not common oral streptococci, including Streptococcus mutans. The generation of both reducing activity and N-terminal alanine residues during lysis indicated that the lysin is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing both glycosidase and endopeptidase activities. This is consistent with the presence of two conserved sequence domains, an Acm (acetylmuramidase) domain associated with lysozyme activity, and a CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases) domain associated with endopeptidase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the CHAP domain and conserved aspartate and glutamate residues in the Acm domain confirmed their importance for lysozyme and endopeptidase activity respectively.
TI  - Increased microbicidal activity of green tea (Camellia sinensis) in combination with butylated hydroxyanisole.
AB  - We have demonstrated that green tea (Camellia sinensis) shows increased antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi when used in combination with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Glycolic extract taken from green tea showed only limited activity against Streptococcus mutans and no activity against Candida albicans and certain strains of Escherichia coli. BHA, at non inhibitory concentrations, increased the microbicidal activity of green tea against 10(10) S. mutans (p<0.01), non-susceptible E. coli (p<0.01) and C. albicans (p<0.01). Green tea in combination with BHA reduced the hydrophobicity of S. mutans (p<0.01) and greatly inhibited (p<0.001) the formation of hyphae in C. albicans. The increased antimicrobial activity of green tea is related to an impairment of the barrier function in microorganisms and a depletion of thiol groups. The increased activity of green tea as an oral antimicrobial product is discussed.
TI  - Streptococcal antigen I/II binds to extracellular proteins through intermolecular beta-sheets.
AB  - One of the functions associated with the oral streptococcal surface protein I/II  is to bind to human extracellular matrix molecules or blood components, which could act as opportunistic ligands in pathological circumstances. In order to understand the relative specificity of the binding repertoire of this bacterial adhesin, we examined by infrared measurements the mode of binding of the protein I/II from Streptococcus mutans OMZ175 (I/IIf) to fibronectin and fibrinogen. This approach revealed the beta-structure forming capacity of I/IIf upon interaction with both proteins. The forming of intermolecular beta-structures may provide a non-selective way of interaction between I/IIf and its possible targets.
TI  - Attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  - Candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, Thermotogales and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. This allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. In particular, orthologs of ygeA of Escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. Three new families of histidine transporters were predicted, orthologs of yuiF and yvsH of Bacillus subtilis, and lysQ of Lactococcus lactis. In Pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thrA was predicted to be regulated not only by threonine and isoleucine, as in E. coli, but also by methionine. In alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvIH was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. Histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in Bacillus cereus and Clostridium difficile, and by histidine T-boxes in L. lactis and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. METHODS: A gradient plate technique was used to expose Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Neisseria subflava, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations of triclosan. Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 was included as an organism showing the triclosan resistance development trait. MIC values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. RESULTS: N. subflava, Pr. nigrescens Po. gingivalis and E. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (MIC range 0.1-3.9 mg/L), whereas the lactobacillus and S. mutans were less susceptible (MIC range 15.6-20.8 mg/L). Triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (P < 0.01) for the positive control E. coli, although its MICs towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. Minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (MIC) occurred for Pr. nigrescens and in S. sanguis and S. oralis (MBC). Mean changes in susceptibilities (MIC and MBC) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine MBCs for S. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for E. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. Other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than FabI that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.
TI  - Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
TI  - Peptide mapping of a novel discontinuous epitope of the major surface adhesin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Guy's 13 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the major cell-surface adhesion protein SA I/II of Streptococcus mutans, one of the major causative agents of dental caries. Passive immunization with Guy's 13 prevents bacterial colonization in humans. To help elucidate the mechanism of prevention of colonization conferred by this antibody, the SA I/II epitope recognized by Guy's 13 was investigated. It was previously established that the epitope is conformational, being assembled from two non-contiguous regions of SA I/II. In the current study, using recombinant fragments of SA I/II and, ultimately, synthetic peptides, the discontinuous epitope was localized to residues 170-218 and 956-969. This work describes the mapping of a novel discontinuous epitope that requires an interaction between each determinant in order for epitope assembly and recognition by antibody to take place. Guy's 13 binds to the assembled epitope but not to these individual epitope fragments. The assembled epitope results from the interaction between the individual antigenic determinants and can be formed by mixing together determinants present on separate polypeptide chains. The data are consistent with one of the epitope fragments adopting a polyproline II-like helical conformation.
TI  - Identification, molecular cloning, and sequence analysis of a deoxyribose aldolase in Streptococcus mutans GS-5.
AB  - Bacterial fitness in the environment, where nutrients are limited and competition is intense, plays a central role in survival and virulence of the organisms. Deoxyribose aldolase, found in several species of bacteria, is known to be involved in the catabolism of deoxynucleosides arising from dead cells, thereby giving a selective advantage to the microorganisms with a capability to consume DNA as an alternative carbon and energy source. A gene encoding a deoxyribose aldolase gene ( deoC) was identified in the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans strain GS-5 by comparative sequence analysis and gene cloning. The gene encodes a protein of 220 amino acids, having a predicted molecular weight of 23.3 kDa with a p I of 5.44. The gene was cloned into the expression vector pFLAG-1, and the biological function of the gene product was analyzed by a complementation assay with a deoC(-) Escherichia coli mutant SPhi063. Transformation of the E. coli SPhi063 with the plasmid construct allowed this organism to grow on glucose minimal medium supplemented with 2 mM deoxyadenosine or deoxythymidine. These results showed activity of deoxyribose aldolase, confirming the identity of the gene. Utilization of exogenous deoxynucleotides as a carbon and energy source may confer a survival and growth advantage to S. mutans over other bacteria in dental plaque, suggesting that deoxyribose aldolase may be a contributing factor to virulence.
TI  - Molecular characterization of dextranase from Streptococcus rattus.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the dextranase gene of Streptococcus rattus ATCC19645 was determined. An open reading frame of the dextranase gene was 2,760 bp long and encoded a dextranase protein consisting of 920 amino acids with a molecular weight of 100,163 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.67. The S. rattus dextranase purified from recombinant Escherichia coli cells showed dextran-hydrolyzing activity with optimal pH (5.0) and temperature (40 C) similar to those of dextranases from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the S. rattus dextranase revealed that the dextranase molecule consists of two variable regions and a conserved region. The variable regions contained an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal cell wall sorting signal; the conserved region contained two functional domains, catalytic and dextran-binding sites. This structural feature of the S. rattus dextranase is quite similar to that of other cariogenic species such as S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and Streptococcus downei.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity on oral pathogens among six types of nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To Compare the antibacterial activity on oral pathogens among six types of nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents. METHODS: The oral pathogens selected were Streptococcus mutans(ATCC6715),Lactobacillus (ATCC4356),Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC19246), Candida Albicans (ATCC76615), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), Escherichia coli (ATCCC25922). Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined by Liquid dilution method. RESULTS: Nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents had fine bactericidal activity against oral pathogens. The general antibacterial activity of six types were nearly equal. CONCLUSION: It is possible that nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents can be used in dental antibacterial materials.
TI  - Microorganisms growth in endodontic citric-acid solutions with and without microbiological stabilizer.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if citric-acid solutions for endodontic use can become contaminated and if the addition of a microbiological stabilizer to the acid would modify this situation. Five types of microorganisms were inoculated in tubes containing 10% citric-acid solutions, pH 1.8 (group A1), and 10% solution, pH 1.8, combined with 0.1% sodium benzoate (group A2). The results demonstrated that solutions of group A1 were contaminated with Candida albicans in 100% of the tubes, Escherichia coli in 80%, and Enterococcus faecalis in 50%. When stabilizer was added (group A2), C. albicans grew in only 30% of tubes and all bacterial species were neutralized.
TI  - Molecular characterization and functional analysis of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54.
AB  - This report describes the isolation, sequencing, and functional analysis of the sodA gene, encoding Mn-superoxide dismutase, from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54. The gene was found to encode a 201 amino acid polypeptide with 88 and 83% identity to SodA from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus agalacticae, respectively. Primer extension analysis revealed a transcriptional start site 27 nucleotides upstream of initiation codon. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and was able to rescue the growth of a sodAsodB mutant in a minimal-medium containing 10(-6)M paraquat. A sodA mutant of S. thermophilus was constructed and found to be more sensitive to aerobic growth than its parent strain. Supplementing the medium with MnCl(2) improved the growth of the mutant, only under microaerophilic conditions. The results suggest that sodA is essential for the aerobic growth of S. thermophilus. In the absence of functional SodA, manganese ions may provide partial protection against oxygen toxicity.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the inhibitory effects of oolong tea polyphenols on glucan-binding domain of recombinant glucosyltransferases from Streptococcus mutans MT8148.
AB  - An oolong tea polyphenol (OTF6) has been shown to possess a strong anti-glucosyltransferase (GTF) activity and inhibit experimental dental caries in rats infected with mutans streptococci. The effects of OTF6 on the functional domains of GTFs of Streptococcus mutans, an N-terminal catalytic domain (CAT), and a C-terminal glucan-binding domain (GBD), were examined. The maximum velocity of glucan synthesis by recombinant GTFB (rGTFB) and GTFD (rGTFD) became significantly slower in the presence of OTF6, however, Km values remained stable when compared in their absence. These results suggest that OTF6 reduces glucan synthesis by non-competitively inhibiting the GBD of S. mutans GTFB and GTFD. Further, the recombinant proteins of CAT (rCAT) and GBD (rGBD) were expressed using Escherichia coli, and purified by affinity column chromatography. rGBD but not rCAT was found to possess dextran-binding activity, which was shown to be inhibited by OTF6. These results indicate that OTF6, a polymeric polyphenol specific for oolong tea is able to reduce glucan synthesis by inhibiting the GBD of S. mutans GTFB.
TI  - Production of an egg yolk antibody specific to microbial uricase and its inhibitory effects on uricase activity.
AB  - Ammonia gas produced from poultry manure can be a potential source of environmental pollution. Microbial uricase in poultry manure is an important target enzyme to reduce ammonia production because ammonia is mainly generated from the microbial decomposition of uric acid in the manure. Thus, the inhibition of microbial uricase is critical in preventing NH3 volatilization. A potential method of inhibiting uricase activity is the use of antibodies specific to microbial uricase. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate 1) the production of the uricase-specific egg yolk antibody (IgY) from immunized hens and 2) the effect of the uricase-specific IgY on the activity of uricase. A total of 12 Single Comb White Leghorn hens were injected intramuscularly with uricase from Arthrobacter globiformis. The hens were immunized a second and third time at 1 and 2 wk, respectively, after the initial injection. The production of uricase-specific IgY was first detected at 2 wk after the initial immunization, and levels increased more than threefold at 4 wk. The method including water extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and ethanol precipitation showed the most acceptable IgY purity and over 97% uricase-specific IgY recovery. Finally, the effect of the uricase-specific IgY on uricase activity was determined by a uricase assay. The slope ratio showed that the immune-IgY from the uricase-immunized hens and nonimmune IgY from nonimmunized control hens reduced uricase degradation by 58 and 43%, respectively, compared to the uricase treatment. The regression slope indicated that the immune IgY and nonimmune IgY treatments had a significant inhibitory effects on uricase activity compared to the uricase.
TI  - An Enterococcus faecium secreted antigen, SagA, exhibits broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix proteins and appears essential for E. faecium growth.
AB  - A gene encoding a major secreted antigen, SagA, was identified in Enterococcus faecium by screening an E. faecium genomic expression library with sera from patients with E. faecium-associated endocarditis. Recombinant SagA protein showed broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibrinogen, collagen type I, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin. A fibrinogen-binding protein, purified from culture supernatants of an E. faecium clinical isolate, was found to match the N-terminal sequence of the predicted SagA protein and to react with the anti-SagA antibody, confirming that it was the SagA protein; this protein appeared as an 80- to 90-kDa smear on a Western blot that was sensitive to proteinase K and resistant to periodate treatment and glycoprotein staining. When overexpressed in E. faecium and Escherichia coli, the native and recombinant SagA proteins formed stable oligomers, apparently via their C-terminal domains. The SagA protein is composed of three domains: (i) a putative coiled-coil N-terminal domain that shows homology to the N-terminal domain of Streptococcus mutans SagA protein (42% similarity), previously shown to be involved in cell wall integrity and cell shape maintenance, and to the P45 protein of Listeria monocytogenes (41% similarity); (ii) a central domain containing direct repeats; and (iii) a C-terminal domain that is similar to that found in various proteins, including P45 (50% similarity) and P60 (52% similarity) of L. monocytogenes. The P45 and P60 proteins both have cell wall hydrolase activity, and the latter has also been shown to be involved in virulence, whereas cell wall hydrolase activity was not detected for SagA protein. The E. faecium sagA gene, like the S. mutans homologue, is located in a cluster of genes encoding proteins that appear to be involved in cell wall metabolism and could not be disrupted unless it was first transcomplemented, suggesting that the sagA gene is essential for E. faecium growth and may be involved in cell wall metabolism. In conclusion, the extracelluar E. faecium SagA protein is apparently essential for growth, shows broad-spectrum binding to ECM proteins, forms oligomers, and is antigenic during infection.
TI  - Biochemical and functional properties of a pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL)-activating system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans has an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL), which is a key enzyme in anaerobic sugar fermentation. We have shown that S. mutans has an activating system, including a PFL-activating enzyme (PFL-activase) and an electron transport system; the latter transfers an electron from NADPH to PFL-activase, as occurs in Escherichia coli. NADPH was a physiological electron donor for the electron transport system and as little as 0.02 mM NADPH activated over 80% of PFL of S. mutans. The optimum pH of the PFL-activating system was around 6.8, whereas the optimum of the E. coli system is at alkaline pH. In addition, small dialyzable molecules in cell-free extracts participated in keeping PFL active in S. mutans. These results suggest that, in dental plaque under anaerobic conditions where sugar supply is often limited or pH frequently falls below neutrality, S. mutans always keeps PFL active through the activating system.
TI  - [Construction and expression of traceable DNA vaccine for prevention of caries].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Streptococcus mutans has been proved as a causative bacteria of human  dental caries. The surface protein antigen is one of the important pathogenic factors. The A region of the surface protein antigen pac gene (pacA) can enrich T-cells and B-cells epitope. In this study, a DNA vaccine carrying pacA and gfp gene (a reporter gene) for caries prevention was constructed. The DNA vaccine was liable to be traced in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The fragment of pacA (1.3 kb) was amplified by PCR with the plasmid pPC41 as template, and inserted into a pEGFP-C1 vector. The recombinant plasmid produced was named as pEGFPC1-pacA. After the COS1 cell line was transfected by the recombinant plasmid, the expression of gfp was detected by observing the green fluorescence and measuring the fluorescence intensity, and the expression of pacA was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Restricted analyzing, sequencing and PCR technique were employed to identify the recombinant plasmid. The phase and orientation of the pacA gene inserted into the vector pEGFPC1 were correct and no changes of their open reading frames were discovered. The transfected COS1 carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) was observed; the GFP expression level of transfected cells was higher than that of controlled cell. The transcript of pacA gene was confirmed by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Construction of the recombinant plasmid was successful. The gfp gene and pacA gene in the plasmid was transcribed and expressed simultaneously in the transfected cells. Moreover, detection of GFP is simple, safe and effective for living cells.
TI  - Fluorescence lifetime measurements of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine in the presence of microbial cells.
AB  - The fluorescence lifetimes of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine (AlPcS2) in the presence of several different microbial cells are measured using the technique of time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) employing front-face illumination. The microbes studied are: Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Gram-negative bacteria), Streptococcus mutans (a Gram-positive bacterium), and the yeast Candida albicans. Complex fluorescence decays are observed when AlPcS2 is in the presence of these microbes; the fluorescence decay data can be fitted to a distribution of exponential lifetimes indicating that the AlPcS2 molecules experience a range of micro-environments The average fluorescence lifetimes of AlPcS2 in the presence of the microbes studied range from 4.85 to 5.95 ns, indicating differences in the cellular localisation of AlPcS2 with each of the microbes studied. These novel data are presented alongside a brief summary of existing AlPcS2 fluorescence lifetime data measured both in solution and in model biological systems.
TI  - Functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in FOS utilization by Lactobacillus species. Analysis of the L. acidophilus NCFM genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the LacI family, a four-component ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. Transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and FOS but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. Additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. Insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the ABC transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on FOS. Comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the association between a fructosidase and an ABC transporter is unusual and may be specific to L. acidophilus. This is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of FOS compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Remote glucosyltransferase-microparticle vaccine delivery induces protective immunity in the oral cavity.
AB  - Intranasally administered dental caries vaccines show significant promise for human application. Alternate mucosal routes may be required, however, to induce caries-protective salivary IgA antibody in children with respiratory diseases. Since rectal mucosa contains inductive lymphoid tissue, we hypothesized that the rectal route could be used to induce salivary immunity to mutans streptococcal glucosyltransferase (GTF), resulting in protective immunity to experimental dental caries. We first explored the ability of glucosyltransferase, incorporated into polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microparticles (MP), and administered rectally together with mucosal adjuvant, to induce a salivary IgA antibody response. Groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (6/group) were immunized rectally on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 with a) GTF-MP alone, b) GTF-MP with cholera toxin, c) GTF-MP with detoxified mutant Escherichia coli toxin (dLT), or d) sham immunized with PLGA and cholera toxin. An additional group was immunized intranasally with GTF-MP alone. Saliva and nasal washes of all intranasally immunized rats contained IgA antibody to glucosyltransferase on day 28. Salivary IgA antibody was also detected in 7/12 rats rectally immunized with GTF-MP and cholera toxin or dLT, although responses were lower than those obtained by intranasal immunization. Most fecal extracts from rectally delivered GTF-MP plus cholera toxin or dLT rats contained IgA antibody to GTF-MP. Low levels of fecal IgA antibody were detected in 3/6 intranasally immunized rats and 2/6 rats rectally immunized with GTF-MP alone. We then examined the extent to which salivary IgA antibody induced by the rectal route could be protective. At 25, 31 and 38 days of age, two groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats (13/group) were rectally immunized with GTF-MP and cholera toxin or with empty microparticles and cholera toxin (sham group). A third group was intranasally immunized with GTF-MP alone. After demonstrating salivary IgA responses to GTF in most GTF-immunized rats, all animals were infected with streptomycin-resistant Streptococcus sobrinus and placed on diet 2000. After 79 days of infection, total caries on molar surfaces were lower in both rectally (7.9 +/- 1.0) and intranasally (7.1 +/- 0.9; P < 0.0.03) immunized groups compared with the sham-immunized group (11.9 +/- 1.6). Smooth surface caries were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in both rectally and intranasally immunized groups. These results support the interconnectedness of the mucosal immune system and indicate that rectal immunization with GTF-MP, together with adjuvant, or intranasal immunization with GTF-MP alone, can induce protective levels of salivary antibody in rats.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic human B defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. Human B Defensin-2 (hBD-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. This peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Therefore, it is thought that hBD-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. However, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. The aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. The antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 was tested against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Escherichia coli. Antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were performed in vitro. The antibacterial activity of hBD-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. Furthermore, the activity of hBD-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. Our results suggest the possibility that synthetic hBD-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.
TI  - The LicT protein acts as both a positive and a negative regulator of loci within  the bgl regulon of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An open reading frame (ORF) that would encode a putative antiterminator protein (LicT) of the BglG family was identified in the genomic DNA sequence of Streptococcus mutans. A DNA sequence that would encode a potential ribonucleic antiterminator (RAT) site in the mRNA at which the putative antitermination protein LicT would bind was located immediately downstream from this ORF. These putative antitermination components are upstream of a glucose-independent beta-glucoside-utilization system that is responsible for aesculin utilization by S. mutans NG8 in the presence of glucose. It was hypothesized that these putative regulatory components were an important mechanism that was involved with the controlled expression of the S. mutans bglP locus. A strain of S. mutans containing a licT : : Omega-Kan2 insertional mutation was created. This strain could not hydrolyse aesculin in the presence of glucose. The transcriptional activity associated with other genes from the bgl regulon was determined in the licT : : Omega-Kan2 genetic background using lacZ transcriptional fusions and beta-galactosidase assays to determine the effect of LicT on these loci. The LicT protein had no significant effect on the expression of the bglC promoter, a regulator of the bglA locus. However, it is essential for the optimal expression of bglP. These data correlate with the phenotype observed on aesculin plates for the S. mutans wild-type strain NG8 and the licT : : Omega-Kan2 strain. Thus, the glucose-independent beta-glucoside-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS) regulon in S. mutans relies on LicT for BglP expression and, in turn, aesculin transport in the presence of glucose. Interestingly, LicT also seems to negatively regulate the expression of the bglA promoter region. In addition, the presence of the S. mutans licT gene has been shown to be able to activate a cryptic beta-glucoside-specific operon found in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Assessment of the utilization of the antisense RNA strategy to identify essential genes in heterologous bacteria.
AB  - We employed an antisense RNA approach to identify essential genes common in both  Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by cloning a random library of Streptococcus mutans chromosomal DNA into an expression vector and transforming Escherichia coli. Twelve out of 27 E. coli transformants with growth defective phenotypes contained individual structural genes of S. mutans in the antisense orientation relative to the E. coli promoter. Thirty-three percent of these transformants (4/12) corresponded to the genes (gyrA, ileS, rplE and yihA orthologs) which are essential for bacterial viability.
TI  - The photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine in microbial systems.
AB  - Front-face illumination spectroscopic techniques were used to study photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine (AlPcS2) in the bacteria and yeast cells Escherichia coil, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Gram-negative bacteria), Streptococcus mutans (a Gram-positive bacterium), and the yeast Candida albicans. The photobleaching of AlPcS2 with the microbes studied is complex, involving reactive species generated by type I and type II processes with the rate dependent on the relative contributions of the different photobleaching mechanisms. The average rate of photobleaching of the AlPcS2 monomer in the presence of both E. coli and C. albicans increases as the fluence of the illumination source decreases. The effects of oxygen and sensitiser concentration on the rate of AlPcS2 photobleaching in these systems are also investigated.
TI  - Mutation of luxS affects biofilm formation in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a bacterial mechanism for regulating gene expression in response to changes in population density. Many bacteria are capable of acyl-homoserine lactone-based or peptide-based intraspecies quorum sensing and luxS-dependent interspecies quorum sensing. While there is good evidence about the involvement of intraspecies quorum sensing in bacterial biofilm, little is known about the role of luxS in biofilm formation. In this study, we report for the first time that luxS-dependent quorum sensing is involved in biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans. S. mutans is a major cariogenic bacterium in the multispecies bacterial biofilm commonly known as dental plaque. An ortholog of luxS for S. mutans was identified using the data available in the S. mutans genome project (http://www.genome.ou.edu/smutans.html). Using an assay developed for the detection of the LuxS-associated quorum sensing signal autoinducer 2 (AI-2), it was demonstrated that this ortholog was able to complement the luxS negative phenotype of Escherichia coli DH5alpha. It was also shown that AI-2 is indeed produced by S. mutans. AI-2 production is maximal during mid- to late-log growth in batch culture. Mutant strains devoid of the luxS gene were constructed and found to be defective in producing the AI-2 signal. There are also marked phenotypic differences between the wild type and the luxS mutants. Microscopic analysis of in vitro-grown biofilm structure revealed that the luxS mutant biofilms adopted a much more granular appearance, rather than the relatively smooth, confluent layer normally seen in the wild type. These results suggest that LuxS-dependent signal may play an important role in biofilm formation of S. mutans.
TI  - The stress-responsive dgk gene from Streptococcus mutans encodes a putative undecaprenol kinase activity.
AB  - We analyzed a previously constructed stress-sensitive Streptococcus mutans mutant Tn-1 strain resulting from disruption by transposon Tn916 of a gene encoding a protein exhibiting amino acid sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase. It was confirmed that the mutation led to significantly reduced lipid kinase activity, while expression of the intact gene on a plasmid restored both kinase activity and the wild-type phenotype. Further analysis revealed that the product of the dgk gene in S. mutans predominantly recognizes a lipid substrate other than diacylglycerol, most likely undecaprenol, as demonstrated by its efficient phosphorylation and the resistance of the product of the reaction to saponification. The physiological role of the product of the dgk gene as a putative undecaprenol kinase was further supported by a significantly higher sensitivity of the mutant to bacitracin compared with that of the parental strain.
TI  - [Construction and cellular expression of GTF-PAc fusion anti-caries DNA vaccine].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a fusion anti-caries DNA vaccine pGLUA-P carrying GLU fragment from gtfB gene of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and A-P fragment including the A region and P region of PAc protein from a DNA anti-caries vaccine pCIA-P, and to investigate its expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. METHODS: The sequence of GLU fragment in pGLU plasmid was testified by DNA sequencing. The fusion anti-caries DNA vaccine was constructed by ligating A-P fragment from pCIA-P to pGLU. The expression of GLUA-P fusion protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was induced by IPTG and checked by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. pGLUA-P was transfected in vitro to cultured rat primary muscle cells by cation liposome Dosper, and immunohistochemical method was used to test the expression of GLUA-P fusion protein in cells. RESULTS: GLU sequence was identical with relative sequence of GTF-I (GS-5 strain) in Gene Bank. Recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid pGLUA-P was confirmed to have both GLU and A-P fragment. After pGLUA-P was transferred into E. coli (DE3), it could express a new 115 000 protein by the induce of IPTG. Specific brown products could be found in the cytoplasm of cultured rat primary muscle cells transfected by pGLUA-P. CONCLUSIONS: Fusion anti-caries DNA vaccine pGLUA-P is successfully constructed and confirmed by sequencing and enzymes digestion. Fusion GLUA-P protein can be correctly expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Identification of immunodominant Helicobacter pylori proteins with reactivity to  H. pylori-specific egg-yolk immunoglobulin.
AB  - The importance of hens eggs as a source of specific antibodies (IgY) is well recognized. The protective effect of IgY obtained from hens immunized with Helicobacter pylori whole-cell lysate has been reported for the control of H. pylori infection. However, IgY produced by whole-cell lysates presents the possibility of cross-reactivity with other bacteria, including the normal human flora, and this could decrease the efficiency of IgY. In the present study, the immunodominant proteins of H. pylori with reactivity to H. pylori-specific IgY (IgY-Hp) were identified. IgY obtained from hens immunized with various fractions of H. pylori proteins was isolated and purified, titres of IgY-Hp against H. pylori were determined and cross-reactivity between IgY-Hp and normal human bacteria was examined by Western blot analysis. Finally, immunodominant H. pylori proteins were identified by LC/MS analysis. IgY obtained 2 months after immunization with H. pylori whole-cell lysate showed the highest antibody titre. Five immunodominant proteins were identified that were strongly reactive to IgY-Hp: urease beta-subunit (62 kDa), heat-shock protein 60 (60 kDa), urease alpha-subunit (26 kDa), probable peroxiredoxin (22 kDa) and probable thiol peroxidase (18 kDa). Immunization of hens with the immunodominant proteins identified would produce a more specific IgY against H. pylori.
TI  - Effects of safrole on the defensive functions of human neutrophils.
AB  - The effects of safrole on the defensive functions of human neutrophils were examined. At the concentrations employed in this study, safrole did not significantly affect the viability of peripheral blood neutrophils as verified by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. However, exposure of neutrophils to safrole inhibited their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans, in a dose dependent manner. In addition, safrole inhibited the production of bactericidal superoxide anion by neutrophils as measured by cytochrome c reduction. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that safrole reduced the antibacterial activity and the superoxide anion production of neutrophils. Inhibition of the defensive functions of neutrophils may be one possible mechanism by which safrole compromises the oral health.
TI  - The next step in infectious disease: taming bacteria.
AB  - Except for immunization programs our warfare with bacteria has always been a frontal assault with antibiotics. In this warfare we win battles, but with every new battle the enemy gets stronger. We need other options. Recent experience suggests two alternatives. First, public health measures designed to control the spread of infectious disease are associated with the selection of less virulent strains of microorganisms. Second, the same selection pressures obtained by public health measures outside the body are brought into play when we inhibit the adherence of bacteria within the body. Two recent studies using food sugars known to inhibit bacterial adherence show long-term benefits best explained by the previously observed decreases in bacterial virulence, following chronic exposure to the respective substances. Cranberry juice selects for less uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and xylitol for less caries producing Streptococcus mutans. The ability of these substances to reduce bacterial adherence in the human host has been known for some time, but poorly utilized. Their in vitro ability to decrease virulence has been reported but not clinically studied.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of the F-ATPase operon from Streptococcus sanguis 10904.
AB  - Oral streptococci utilize an F-ATPase to regulate cytoplasmic pH. Previous studies have shown that this enzyme is a principal determinant of aciduricity in the oral streptococcal species Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Differences in the pH optima of the respective ATPases appears to be the main reason that S. mutans is more tolerant of low pH values than S. sanguis and hence pathogenic. We have recently reported the genetic arrangement for the S. mutans operon. For purposes of comparative structural biology we have also investigated the F-ATPase from S. sanguis. Here, we report the genetic characterization and expression in Escherichia coli of the S. sanguis ATPase operon. Sequence analysis showed a gene order of atpEBFHAGDC and that a large intergenic space existed upstream of the structural genes. Activity data demonstrate that ATPase activity is induced under acidic conditions in both S. sanguis and S. mutans; however, it is not induced to the same extent in the nonpathogenic S. sanguis. Expression studies with an atpD deletion strain of E. coli showed that S. sanguis-E. coli hybrid enzymes were able to degrade ATP but were not sufficiently functional to permit growth on succinate minimal media. Hybrid enzymes were found to be relatively insensitive to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, indicating loss of productive coupling between the membrane and catalytic subunits.
TI  - [Construction of eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3-gtfB expressing glucosyltransferase B of Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glucosyltransferase (GTF) of Streptococcus mutans is considered as a cariogenic virulence factor due to its ability to synthesize glucan, which facilitate sucrose-depended adherence and cell-to-cell accumulation of bacteria. In this study, gtfB, the target gene fragment which encodes multiple catalytic sites and antigen epitopes of GTF, was recombined into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. The feasibility of the recombination plasmid pcDNA3-gtfB used as gene vaccine will be investigated in further study. METHODS: The target gene fragment gtfB (904-4578 bp) was obtained by standard PCR amplification while genome DNA of streptococcus mutans GS-5 was used as template. Then the PCR products were extracted and purified from low-melting temperature agarose. The gtfB and plasmid pcDNA3 were cut by Kpn I, Xho I, and the digested products were extracted and purified again for recombination. The purified gtfB and plasmid pcDNA3 were recombined by T4 DNA ligase, ligation products were transformed into competent cell, Escherichia coli JM109. Transformed colonies were screened by Ampr LB plate, then recombined plasmids were isolated and identified by restricted endonuclease cutting and Sanger dideoxy DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Identified by agarose gel electrophoresis, the target gene-gtfB obtained PCR amplification had the same molecular size (36 kb) as predicted. It was indicated that recombined plasmids contained inserted gtfB gene fragment by restricted endonuclease cut analysis, the sequencing data also indicated that inserted gtfB gene had correct DNA sequence and orientation according to DNA sequence of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 (gene bank M17361). CONCLUSION: Inserted gene-gtfB of recombined plasmid pcDNA3-gtfB encoded multiple catalytic sites and epitopes. It was proved that these epitopes had high immune antigenicity and that antiserum could significantly inhibit the synthesis of water-insoluble glucans and water-soluble glucan. In vitro adherence experiment also indicated that it could inhibit streptococcus mutans adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. Vector pcDNA3 was high expressing eukaryotic vector, and could stimulate antigen-representing cell. It was suggested that recombined plasmid pcDNA3-gtfB had high immune antigenicity and immune responsiveness, and this supported its use as gene vaccine candidates in the development of anti-caries vaccines.
TI  - [Construction of two eukaryotic expression plasmids pcDNA3/pacA and pcDNA3/pacP expressing surface protein antigen of Streptococcus mutans].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two gene vaccines which encoded amino terminal and intermediate region in the PAc protein were constructed and the feasibility and safety was investigated, in order to obtain a highly effective and secure anticarious way by immunization. METHODS: The target gene fragments pac-A and pac-P encoded amino terminal and intermediate region of surface protein antigen from Streptococcus mutans were obtained by PCR amplification respectively. Amplification products were isolated by using low melting-temperature agarose and recoveried from the gel. Then the two fragments were digested by Kpn I and Xho I, and ligated to the Kpn I-Xho I-digested eukaryotic shuttle expression vector pcDNA3 to create reconstructed plasmids pcDNA3/pacA and pcDNA3/pacP respectively. The ligated DNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue. Transformed colonies carrying eukaryotic expression plasmid either pcDNA3/pacA or pcDNA3/pacP were screened by colony hybridization in situ. Then the reconstructed plasmids were isolated and identified by restricted endonuclease digestions, Southern hybridization and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: 1. Two DNA fragments pac-A and pac-P of the predicted size 1.3 kb and 1.2 kb were obtained by PCR amplified. 2. Eukaryotic expression plasmids pcDNA3/pacA and pcDNA3/pacP had been reconstructed correctly. 3. The sequencing data also indicated that the pcDNA3 construct contained the correct sequence and orientation of the two target genes. CONCLUSION: These two plasmids may act as gene vaccines for further study.
TI  - [Construction of Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3-PAc. II. Testified efficiency of repeated using glass fiber chromatographic column].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore one method getting highly purified plasmid DNA and costing  low. METHODS: According to principle of extraction and purification plasmid DNA of glass fiber chromatographic column, its operation sequence was improved so that disposable glass fiber chromatographic column could be used repeatedly. The concentration and purity of plasmid DNA obtained by 12 times repeated using glass fiber chromatographic column were determined by spectrophotometry. Moreover, Those plasmid DNA obtained were tested by restriction enzyme and agarose gel electrophoresis, Ligation in vitro and transformation test. RESULTS: 12 times repeated use of glass fiber chromatographic column made no significant difference to the concentration and purity of obtained plasmid DNA (P < 0.05), and plasmid DNA was completely digested by restriction enzyme. The digested fragments were well ligated together by the action of T4 DNA Ligase in ATP ligating buffer in vitro and ligated DNA was well transformed into E. coli. CONCLUSION: Repeated use glass fiber chromatographic column can obtain a lot of highly purified plasmid DNA and cost is low. Digestion, ligation and transformation of those plasmid DNA are not affected. The results may be significant in molecular cloning and study of gene vaccination.
TI  - [Construction of Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3-PAc. I. Extraction and purification of plasmid DNA pPC41 and pcDNA3].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To Extract and purify plasmid DNA pPC41 and pcDNA3. METHODS: Bacteria  were collected and lyzed by the alkaline lysis method. The plasmid pPC41 carrying structural gene pac and clone expression vector pcDNA3 were extracted and purified from E. coli clone by the polyethylene glycol precipitating method, the electroelution into dialysis bags method, the low melting-temperature agarose gel and glass fiber column chromatography. The concentration, purity and molecular weight were determined by spectrophotometry, restriction enzyme and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The concentration of plasmid DNA of this experiment in general was 0.12-0.24 g/L, and A260/A280 of the polyethylene glycol precipitating method, the electroelution into dialysis bags method, the low metling-temperature agrose gel and glass fiber column chromatography were respectively 1.9, 2.2, 2.2 and 2.6. Molecular weight of pPC41 and pcDNA3 was respectively 10.6 kb and 5.4 kb. CONCLUSION: The four methods can obtain pure plasmid DNA. Purity of plasmid DNA obtained by glass fiber column chromatography method is the highest in the four methods. Glass fiber column chromatography is one of the effective methods getting highly purified plasmid DNA.
TI  - [Isolation, purification and antibacterial activities of salivary histidine-rich  polypeptides].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and purify salivary histidine-rich-polypeptides (HRPs) and  observe their antibacterial activities. METHODS: By using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE), three major HRPs(HRP-1, HRP-3 and HRP-5) were purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults. Their antibacterial activities were tested in the ultrasensitive antibacterial assay, named radial diffusion assay. RESULTS: Each fraction of the three purified HRPs appeared as a single protein zone both in AU-PAGE and Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Their molecular weights are 3-5 kD as determined by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. All the three major HRPs showed potent bactericidal effects on Streptococcus mutans MT6R and Staphylococcus aureas ATCC25923. As to Escherichia coli ML-35P and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, HRP-3 and HRP-5 also demonstrated significant antibacterial activities, whereas HRP-1 did not show any inhibitory effects on the viability of them. CONCLUSION: The above results suggested that the method of preparative AU-PAGE we used in this study has the benefits of high resolution, simple manipulation and perfect results of purification. HRPs are important components to prevent oral tissue from bacterial infections, therefore play a potent role in the maintenance of the oral health.
TI  - A novel mechanism for glucose side-chain formation in rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide synthesis.
AB  - We have cloned two genes (rgpH and rgpI) that encode proteins for the formation of the glucose side-chains of the Streptococcus mutans rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP), which consists of a rhamnan backbone with glucose side-chains. The roles of rgpH and rgpI were evaluated in a rhamnan-synthesizing Escherichia coli. An E. coli strain that harbored rgpH reacted with antiserum directed against complete RGP, whereas the E. coli strain that carried rgpI did not react with this antiserum. Although E. coli:rgpH reacted strongly with rhamnan-specific antiserum, co-transformation of this strain with rgpI increased the number of glucose side-chains and decreased immunoreactivity with the rhamnan-specific antiserum significantly. These results suggest that two genes are involved in side-chain formation during S. mutans RGP synthesis in E. coli: one gene encodes a glucosyltransferase, and the other gene probably controls the frequency of branching. This is the first report to identify a gene that is involved in regulation of branching frequency in polysaccharide synthesis.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation: utilization of a gtfB promoter-green fluorescent protein (PgtfB::gfp) construct to monitor development.
AB  - The glucosyltransferases of Streptococcus mutans are recognized as important virulence factors for this cariogenic bacterium. To study the expression of the gtfB gene of S. mutans in biofilms, a gtfB promoter (PgtfB)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system was developed. A Streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector harbouring a PGTFB::gfp cassette was introduced into S. mutans GS-5, and the expression of GFP by the transformed S. mutans cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out on biofilms attached to polystyrene plates; enhanced gtfB expression was observed in various microcolonies across these biofilms. To further test the hypothesis that gtfB expression is upregulated in biofilms, flow cytometry analysis was done on planktonic and biofilm cells; this analysis showed an approximately five-fold increase in gtfB expression in the biofilm cells relative to the planktonic cells. Real-time (TaqMan) PCR analysis confirmed that gtfB expression in the biofilm cells was enhanced relative to the planktonic cells. Previously, it has been suggested that the S. mutans gtfC gene might be co-transcribed with gtfB. Therefore, RT-PCR analysis was performed on gtfB-expressing S. mutans; this analysis demonstrated that gtfC was co-transcribed with gtfB. These results indicated that GFP expression can be utilized to examine gene regulation in S. mutans biofilm formation.
TI  - Characterization of a novel fructosyltransferase from Lactobacillus reuteri that  synthesizes high-molecular-weight inulin and inulin oligosaccharides.
AB  - Fructosyltransferase (FTF) enzymes produce fructose polymers (fructans) from sucrose. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an FTF-encoding gene from Lactobacillus reuteri strain 121. A C-terminally truncated version of the ftf gene was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. When incubated with sucrose, the purified recombinant FTF enzyme produced large amounts of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) with beta-(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units, plus a high-molecular-weight fructan polymer (>10(7)) with beta-(2-->1) linkages (an inulin). FOS, but not inulin, was found in supernatants of L. reuteri strain 121 cultures grown on medium containing sucrose. Bacterial inulin production has been reported for only Streptococcus mutans strains. FOS production has been reported for a few bacterial strains. This paper reports the first-time isolation and molecular characterization of (i) a Lactobacillus ftf gene, (ii) an inulosucrase associated with a generally regarded as safe bacterium, (iii) an FTF enzyme synthesizing both a high molecular weight inulin and FOS, and (iv) an FTF protein containing a cell wall-anchoring LPXTG motif. The biological relevance and potential health benefits of an inulosucrase associated with an L. reuteri strain remain to be established.
TI  - Analysis of a dextran-binding domain of the dextranase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the dextran-binding domain of the dextranase (Dex) of Streptococcus mutans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Deletion mutants of the Dex gene of Strep. mutans were prepared by polymerase chain reaction and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Binding of the truncated Dexs to dextran was measured with a Sephadex G-150 gel. Although the Dexs which lacked the N-terminal variable region lost enzyme activity, they still retained dextran-binding ability. In addition, further deletion into the conserved region from the N-terminal did not influence the dextran-binding ability. However, the Dex which carried a deletion in the C-terminus still possessed both enzyme activity and dextran-binding ability. Further deletion into the conserved region from the C-terminal resulted in complete disappearance of both enzyme and dextran-binding activities. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion analysis of the Dex gene of Strep. mutans showed that the C-terminal side (about 120 amino acid residues) of the conserved region of the Dex was essential for dextran-binding ability. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The dextran-binding domain was present in a different area from the catalytic site in the conserved region of the Dex molecule. The amino acid sequence of the dextran-binding domain of the Dex differed from those of glucan-binding regions of other glucan-binding proteins reported.
TI  - Mechanism by which metal cofactors control substrate specificity in pyrophosphatase.
AB  - Family I soluble pyrophosphatases (PPases) exhibit appreciable ATPase activity in the presence of a number of transition metal ions, but not the physiological cofactor Mg(2+). The results of the present study reveal a strong correlation between the catalytic efficiency of three family I PPases (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and rat liver) and one family II PPase (from Streptococcus mutans ) in ATP and tripolyphosphate (P(3)) hydrolysis in the presence of Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+) on the one hand, and the phosphate-binding affinity of the enzyme subsite P2 that interacts with the electrophilic terminal phosphate group of ATP on the other. A similar correlation was observed in S. cerevisiae PPase variants with modified P1 and P2 subsites. The effect of the above metal ion cofactors on ATP binding to S. cerevisiae PPase paralleled their effect on phosphate binding, resulting in a low affinity of Mg-PPase to ATP. We conclude that PPase mainly binds ATP and P(3) through the terminal phosphate group that is attacked by water. Moreover, this interaction is critical in creating a reactive geometry at the P2 site with these bulky substrates, which do not otherwise fit the active site perfectly. We propose further that ATP is not hydrolysed by Mg-PPase, since its interaction with the terminal phosphate is not adequately strong for proper positioning of the nucleophile-electrophile pair.
TI  - 3-Chloro-DL-alanine resistance by L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  - The antibacterial agent 3-chloro-DL-alanine (3CA) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mM 3CA, whereas Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. We isolated the 3CA resistance gene from F. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an L-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of L-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. The enzyme also exhibits 3CA chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. This antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
TI  - Fighting infectious diseases with inhibitors of microbial adhesion to host tissues.
AB  - The majority of infectious diseases are initiated by the adhesion of pathogenic organisms to the tissues of the host. In many cases this adhesion is mediated by lectins present on the surface of the infectious organism that bind to complementary carbohydrates on the surface of the host tissues. Soluble carbohydrates recognized by the bacterial lectins block the adhesion of the bacteria to animal cells in vitro. Moreover, such carbohydrates have been shown to protect against experimental infection by lectin-carrying bacteria of different mammals, such as mice, rabbits, calves, and monkeys. Agents other than carbohydrates also block adhesion, as demonstrated with cranberry juice as well as with low and high molecular weight preparations isolated from the juice. Both kinds of preparation inhibited the adhesion in vitro of Escherichia coli to different animal cells. In addition, the high molecular weight material acted similarly on the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to human gasrointenstinal cells, and on the coaggregation of oral bacteria. Furthermore, in limited clinical studies regular drinking of cranberry juice had a significant preventive effect on bacteriuria, and the high molecular weight constituent of the juices was also effective in decreasing the salivary level of Streptococus mutans, the major cause of tooth decay. Because the inhibitors of adhesion examined are not bactericidal, the selection of resistant inhibitor strains is unlikely to occur. Together, these findings may lead to new therapeutic strategies that are in dire need because of the world-wide increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria.
TI  - Crystal structure of the V-region of Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II at 2.4 A resolution suggests a sugar preformed binding site.
AB  - Antigens I/II are large multifunctional adhesins from oral viridans streptococci  that exert immunomodulatory effects on human cells and play important roles in inflammatory disorders. Among them, Streptococcus mutans plays a major role in the initiation of dental caries. The structure of the V-region (SrV+, residues 464-840) of the antigen I/II of S. mutans has been determined using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing technique with seleno-methionine-substituted recombinant protein and subsequently refined at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal structure of SrV+ revealed a lectin-like fold that displays a putative preformed carbohydrate-binding site stabilized by a metal ion. Inhibition of this binding site may confer to humans a protection against dental caries and dissemination of the bacteria to extra-oral sites involved in life-threatening inflammatory diseases. This crystal structure constitutes a first step in understanding the structure-function relationship of antigens I/II and may help in delineating new preventive or therapeutic strategies against colonization of the host by oral streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of foodborne Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. against Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - The saprophytic Paenibacillus and Bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of Clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. Culture supernatants of 200 strains of Paenibacillus and Bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against C. botulinum type A, proteolytic type B, and type E strains in a well diffusion assay. Nineteen strains were positive against C. botulinum. Among those, seven Paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the largest antimicrobial spectrum against C. botulinum strains. The antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive P. polymyxa strains. The antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees C and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees C in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. In co-cultures with the positive strain of P. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a C. botulinum type E strain was inhibited whenever P. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before C. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. The antimicrobial activity of P. polymyxa against C. botulinum was attributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. Other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to these antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the antimicrobial action of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan with a lipid-depleting detergent-based handwash product with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate. The zones of inhibition produced by the two handwash lotions and the one produced by the positive control were similar against all strains of bacteria tested, indicating that a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan is as effective as a lipid-depleting handwash lotion in inhibiting bacterial activity.
TI  - Expression and characterization of streptococcal rgp genes required for rhamnan synthesis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Six genes (rgpA through rgpF) that were involved in assembling the rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP) in Streptococcus mutans were previously identified (Y. Yamashita, Y. Tsukioka, K. Tomihisa, Y. Nakano, and T. Koga, J. Bacteriol. 180:5803-5807, 1998). The group-specific antigens of Lancefield group A, C, and E streptococci and the polysaccharide antigen of Streptococcus sobrinus have the same rhamnan backbone as the RGP of S. mutans. Escherichia coli harboring plasmid pRGP1 containing all six rgp genes did not synthesize complete RGP. However, E. coli carrying a plasmid with all of the rgp genes except for rgpE synthesized the rhamnan backbone of RGP without glucose side chains, suggesting that in addition to rgpE, another gene is required for glucose side-chain formation. Synthesis of the rhamnan backbone in E. coli required the initiation of transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to a lipid carrier and the expression of the rgpC and rgpD genes encoding the putative ABC transporter specific for RGP. The similarities in RGP synthesis between E. coli and S. mutans suggest common pathways for rhamnan synthesis. Therefore, we evaluated the rhamnosyl polymerization process in E. coli by high-resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS). An E. coli transformant harboring rgpA produced the LOS modified by the addition of a single rhamnose residue. Furthermore, the rgpA, rgpB, and rgpF genes of pRGP1 were independently mutated by an internal deletion, and the LOS chemotypes of their transformants were examined. The transformant with an rgpA deletion showed the same LOS profile as E. coli without a plasmid. The transformant with an rgpB deletion showed the same LOS profile as E. coli harboring rgpA alone. The transformant with an rgpF deletion showed the LOS band with the most retarded migration. On the basis of these results, we speculated that RgpA, RgpB, and RgpF, in that order, function in rhamnan polymerization.
TI  - An iron-binding protein, Dpr, from Streptococcus mutans prevents iron-dependent hydroxyl radical formation in vitro.
AB  - The dpr gene is an antioxidant gene which was isolated from the Streptococcus mutans chromosome by its ability to complement an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli, and it was proven to play an indispensable role in oxygen tolerance in S. mutans. Here, we purified the 20-kDa dpr gene product, Dpr, from a crude extract of S. mutans as an iron-binding protein and found that Dpr formed a spherical oligomer about 9 nm in diameter. Molecular weight determinations of Dpr in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation and light-scattering analyses gave values of 223,000 to 292,000, consistent with a subunit composition of 11.5 to 15 subunits per molecule. The purified Dpr contained iron and zinc atoms and had an ability to incorporate up to 480 iron and 11.2 zinc atoms per molecule. Unlike E. coli Dps and two other members of the Dps family, Dpr was unable to bind DNA. One hundred nanomolar Dpr prevented by more than 90% the formation of hydroxyl radical generated by 10 microM iron(II) salt in vitro. The data shown in this study indicate that Dpr may act as a ferritin-like iron-binding protein in S. mutans and may allow this catalase- and heme-peroxidase-deficient bacterium to grow under air by limiting the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction.
TI  - Buccoadhesive erodible disk for treatment of oro-dental infections: design and characterisation.
AB  - Buccoadhesive erodible disks of cetylpyridinium chloride were prepared using different bioadhesive polymers along with excipients like mannitol. The purpose of designing the erodible disk was to obviate the need for removal of exhausted device. The optimized disk containing 5.0 mg of cetylpyridinium chloride, 2.0 mg of magnesium stearate and 6.0 mg of mannitol along with sodium carboxy methyl cellulose DVP and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose K4M in the ratio of 1:3 was found to release the drug for a period of over 6.0 h without getting dislodged. Maximum in vitro drug release was found to be 94.78% in 6.0-h study. In situ release characteristics were evaluated using a 'flow-through assembly', which simulated the conditions of the human buccal cavity. The drug concentrations in the in situ samples were found to be above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug. The bioadhesive performance and the surface pH of the disks were satisfactory. Cetylpyridinium chloride disks were tested against microorganisms commonly found in oro-dental infections namely Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans. The disk as well as the in situ samples showed inhibition of growth of microorganisms. Approval was taken from Jamia Hamdard Review Board (Ethical Board) to perform in vivo studies in healthy human volunteers. In vivo evaluation of buccoadhesive disks revealed adequate comfort, taste, and non-irritation and none of the volunteers reported severe dry mouth/severe salivation or heaviness at the place of attachment. Salivary concentrations were maintained above MIC for 8.0 h. Correlation was found between the drug concentration in situ and concentration of drug in saliva collected in healthy human volunteers. The correlation was found to be positive with a correlation coefficient of 0.9596. It was found to be statistically significant at 5% confidence level (P<0.05).
TI  - Construction of transcriptional and translational lacZ gene reporter plasmids for use in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Reporter genes have become standard genetic tools used to evaluate either the transcriptional or the translational activity associated with genes of interest, whose products cannot be easily assayed. The lacZ gene from Escherichia coli has been used very effectively to quantify such regulated activities in many different organisms. This report describes the construction of a pair of plasmids that may be used for either transcriptional or translational lacZ gene fusions in Streptococcus mutans. The translational E. coli beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) fusion plasmid, pALH109, as well as the transcriptional lacZ gene fusion plasmid, pALH122, have been used successfully in S. mutans to measure the activity of various PTS genes. Both plasmids employ fusions with the E. coli lacZ gene that can be easily quantified using standard O-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) based enzyme assays or the more sensitive fluorometric assays using 4-methyl-umbelliferyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (MUG) as the enzyme substrate. Currently, there has been only one other report of the use of lacZ as a gene reporter in S. mutans. The plasmids described in this paper will provide new tools and techniques for the analysis of S. mutans gene regulation. In addition, we have compiled the complete nucleotide sequences of these gene reporter plasmids.
TI  - An NADH-dependent bacterial thioredoxin reductase-like protein in conjunction with a glutaredoxin homologue form a unique peroxiredoxin (AhpC) reducing system in Clostridium pasteurianum.
AB  - Many eubacterial genomes including those of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus mutans, and Thermus aquaticus encode a dedicated flavoprotein reductase (AhpF, Nox1, or PrxR) just downstream of the structural gene for their peroxiredoxin (Prx, AhpC) homologue to reduce the latter protein during turnover. In contrast, the obligate anaerobe Clostridium pasteurianum codes for a two-component reducing system upstream of the ahpC homologue. These three structural genes, herein designated cp34, cp9, and cp20, were previously identified upstream of the rubredoxin gene in C. pasteurianum, but were not linked to expression of the latter gene [Mathieu, I., and Meyer, J. (1993) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 112, 223-227]. cp34, cp9, and cp20 have been expressed in Escherichia coli, and their products have been purified and characterized. Cp34 and Cp9 together catalyze the NADH-dependent reduction of Cp20 to effect the reduction of various hydroperoxide substrates. Cp34, containing noncovalently bound FAD and a redox-active disulfide center, is an unusual member of the low-M(r) thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) family. Like Escherichia coli TrxR, Cp34 lacks the 200-residue N-terminal AhpC-reducing domain present in S. typhimurium AhpF. Although Cp34 is more similar to TrxR than to AhpF in sequence comparisons of the nucleotide-binding domains, experiments demonstrated that NADH was the preferred reductant (Km = 2.65 microM). Cp9 (a distant relative of bacterial glutaredoxins) is a direct electron acceptor for Cp34, possesses a redox-active CXXC active site, and mediates the transfer of electrons from Cp34 to several disulfide-containing substrates including 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), insulin, and Cp20. These three proteins are proposed to play a vital role in the defense of C. pasteurianum against oxidative damage and may help compensate for the putative lack of catalase activity in this organism.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - A XerD recombinase with unusual active site motifs in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - XerD belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. Sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of E. coli XerD and related enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids R-H-R-H that are spaced along the C-terminal domain in addition to a conserved K and the active site Y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative S. pneumoniae XerD contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in L-Q-R-L; moreover, the active site Y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme C-terminal region suggested to be involved in interaction of E. coli XerD with XerC was lacking. Severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerD mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the S. pneumoniae XerD protein. Highly related xerD genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in S. mitis, S. mutans and S. pyogenes but not in other Gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. There are at least another four genes in the S. pneumoniae KNR_7/87 genome encoding Xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerC homologue. The xerD and xerC genes were present in a sample of 20 S. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.
TI  - Expression of Streptococcus mutans wall-associated protein A gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells: prospect for a dental caries DNA vaccine.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans strain GS-5 wall-associated protein A (Wap-A) is a precursor to the extracellular antigen A (AgA), a recognized candidate dental caries vaccine. The full-length wapA gene (wapA-E) and a C-terminal truncated version (wapA-G) encoding the AgA were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1/V5/His-TOPO. The resulting constructs were propagated in the Escherichia coli Top10. To investigate the expression of the S. mutans genes in mammalian cells, the above constructs were used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the presence of the cationic lipid pfx-8. Transient expression of the wapA-E and wapA-G genes was observed at 24 h post-transfection, as shown by Western immunoblot analysis using a rabbit antiserum to S. mutans cell wall. Immunochemical staining of the transfected CHO cells showed expression of WapA mainly in the cells and budding vesicles, whereas AgA was found mainly in the transfected cells and extracellular medium. The expression of S. mutans proteins in CHO cells, in either vesicles or soluble form, suggested an antibody response to the above DNA constructs. Work is under way to test the efficacy of these as DNA vaccines against S. mutans.
TI  - Scavenging of free radicals, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of the Maillard reaction products of beta-lactoglobulin glycated with several sugars.
AB  - The Maillard reaction occurs during many industrial and domestic thermal treatments of foods. It is widely used because of its role in creating colors, flavors, textures, and other functional properties in foodstuffs. Proteins glycated without the use of conventional chemical reagents have improved technofunctional properties such as heat stability, emulsifying, and foaming properties. The present study was carried out to determine the extent to which this reaction can convey antioxidant, antimicrobial, or cytotoxic activities to beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and to its tryptic and peptic hydrolysates. BLG was modified with six different sugars in solution at 60 degrees C. Antiradical properties were estimated using a radical scavenging activity test. Antimicrobial activities against different bacterial strains were studied with a diffusion disk method. Cytotoxic tests were performed using two cell lines and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) rapid colorimetric assay. Glycation induced a radical scavenging activity to BLG, the intensity of which depended on the sugar used for modification. Proteins modified with ribose and arabinose showed the highest radical scavenging activities depicted by about 80 and 60% of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) absorption decrease at 515 nm. No antimicrobial effect of any glycated form of BLG against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, and Streptococcus mutans was observed. The MTT test showed no enhancement of cytotoxicity by modified proteins and peptides against COS-7 and HL-60 cells. Thus, glycated proteins could be used in formulated food as functional ingredients with a radical scavenging activity able to delay deterioration due to oxidation. This use could be even more advisable considering the lack of toxicity to eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell cultures demonstrated in this work.
TI  - A 60-kilodalton immunodominant glycoprotein is essential for cell wall integrity  and the maintenance of cell shape in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We have demonstrated previously by Western blotting that in naturally sensitized  humans, the serum or salivary antibody response to Streptococcus mutans was directed predominantly to a protein antigen with a size of approximately 60-kDa. To identify this immunodominant antigen, specific serum antibodies were eluted from immunoblots and five positive clones with inserts ranging in length from 3 to 8 kb from identical chromosomal loci were obtained by screening a genomic expression library of Streptococcus mutans GS-5. Amino acid sequencing established the identity of this immunodominant antigen, a 60-kDa immunodominant glycoprotein (IDG-60), to be a cell wall-associated general stress protein GSP-781, which was originally predicted to have a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa based on the derived nucleotide sequence. Discrepancy in the molecular mass was also observed in recombinant his-tagged IDG-60 (rIDG-60) expressed from Escherichia coli. Glycosylation, consisting of sialic acid, mannose galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine, was detected by lectin binding to IDG-60 in cell wall extracts from S. mutans and rIDG-60 expressed in vivo or translated in vitro. Despite the presence of multiple Asn or Ser or Thr glycosylation sites, IDG-60 was resistant to the effect of N-glycosidase F and multiple O-glycosidase molecules but not to beta-galactosidase. Insertional inactivation of the gene encoding IDG-60, sagA, resulted in a retarded growth rate, destabilization of the cell wall, and pleiomorphic cell shape with multifold ingrowth of cell wall. In addition, distinct from the parental GS-5 strain, the isogenic mutant GS-51 was unable to survive the challenge of low pH and high osmotic pressure or high temperature. Expression of the wild-type gene in trans within GS-51 from plasmid pDL277 complemented the growth defect and restored normal cell shape. These results suggested that IDG-60 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell wall and the uniformity of cell shape, both of which are indispensable for bacteria survival under stress conditions.
TI  - Contributions of three glycosyltransferases to sucrose-dependent adherence of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans produces 3 types of glucosyltransferase (GTF), whose cooperative action is considered to be essential for its cellular adherence to the tooth surface. However, the precise mechanisms for synthesizing adhesive glucans and the specific roles of each GTF in cellular adherence to smooth surfaces have not been elucidated. In the present study, seven types of isogenic mutants of S. mutans MT8148 lacking GTFB, GTFC, and/or GTFD activities were constructed by inactivation of the genes encoding GTFB, GTFC, and/or GTFD. Furthermore, recombinant GTFB, GTFC, and GTFD were prepared from Escherichia coli cells harboring recombinant plasmids containing each of the gtf genes. Using these GTF-deficient mutants and rGTFs, we reconstituted sucrose-dependent adherence of S. mutans resting cells and examined the role of each GTF in vitro. The highest level of sucrose-dependent adherence was found at the ratio of 20 rGTFB:1 rGTFC:4 rGTFD in both the resting cells of GTF-deficient mutants and insoluble glucan synthesized by rGTFs. Moreover, when rGTFC and rGTFD were both present at concentrations of 1.5 mU and 6 mU, respectively, the insoluble glucan synthesized from sucrose by the rGTFs showed a high level of adhesiveness to smooth surfaces, even without rGTFB. These results suggest that the presence of all three GTFs at the optimum ratio is necessary for sucrose-dependent adherence of S. mutans, and that GTFC and GTFD may play significant roles in the synthesis of adhesive and insoluble glucan from sucrose.
TI  - Genetic and physiologic analysis of the groE operon and role of the HrcA repressor in stress gene regulation and acid tolerance in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Our working hypothesis is that the major molecular chaperones DnaK and GroE play  central roles in the ability of oral bacteria to cope with the rapid and frequent stresses encountered in oral biofilms, such as acidification and nutrient limitation. Previously, our laboratory partially characterized the dnaK operon of Streptococcus mutans (hrcA-grpE-dnaK) and demonstrated that dnaK is up-regulated in response to acid shock and sustained acidification (G. C. Jayaraman, J. E. Penders, and R. A. Burne, Mol. Microbiol. 25:329-341, 1997). Here, we show that the groESL genes of S. mutans constitute an operon that is expressed from a stress-inducible sigma(A)-type promoter located immediately upstream of a CIRCE element. GroEL protein and mRNA levels were elevated in cells exposed to a variety of stresses, including acid shock. A nonpolar insertion into hrcA was created and used to demonstrate that HrcA negatively regulates the expression of the groEL and dnaK operons. The SM11 mutant, which had constitutively high levels of GroESL and roughly 50% of the DnaK protein found in the wild-type strain, was more sensitive to acid killing and could not lower the pH as effectively as the parent. The acid-sensitive phenotype of SM11 was, at least in part, attributable to lower F(1)F(0)-ATPase activity. A minimum of 10 proteins, in addition to GroES-EL, were found to be up-regulated in SM11. The data clearly indicate that HrcA plays a key role in the regulation of chaperone expression in S. mutans and that changes in the levels of the chaperones profoundly influence acid tolerance.
TI  - uvrA is an acid-inducible gene involved in the adaptive response to low pH in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The pH-inducible acid tolerance response (ATR) is believed to play a major role in acid adaptation and virulence of Streptococcus mutans. To study this phenomenon in S. mutans JH1005, differential display PCR was used to identify and clone 13 cDNA products that had increased expression in response to pH 5.0 compared to that of pH 7.5-grown cells. One of these products, confirmed to be pH inducible by RNA dot blot and reverse transcription-PCR analyses, had 67% identity to a uvrA-UV repair excinuclease gene in Bacillus subtilis. Further sequence analysis of the uvrA homologue using the S. mutans genome database revealed that the complete gene was encoded in an open reading frame (ORF) of 2,829 bp (944 amino acids; 104.67 kDa). Immediately 3' of uvrA was an ORF encoding a putative aminopeptidase gene (pepP). uvrA knockouts were constructed in S. mutans strains JH1005, NG8, and UA159 using allelic-exchange mutagenesis, replacing the entire gene with an erythromycin resistance cassette. As with uvrA mutants in other bacteria, the S. mutans uvrA mutants were extremely sensitive to UV irradiation. The uvrA mutant of S. mutans JH1005 was also more sensitive than the wild type to growth at pH 5.0, showing a 15% reduction in growth rate and a 14% reduction in final resting culture density. Acid-adapted S. mutans JH1005 uvrA mutants were shown to be more resistant to UV irradiation than was the parent but were unable to survive exposure to a killing pH of 3.0. Moreover, agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of chromosomal DNA isolated from uvrA-deficient cells exposed to low pH demonstrated more DNA damage than that for the wild-type strain. Here we suggest that uvrA and the nucleotide excision repair pathway are involved in the repair of acid-induced DNA damage and are associated with successful adaptation of S. mutans to low pH.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and molecular characterization of a dextranase gene from Streptococcus downei.
AB  - DNA fragments encoding the Streptococcus downei dextranase were amplified by PCR  and inverse PCR based on a comparison of the dextranase gene (dex) sequences from S. sobrinus, S. mutans, and S. salivarius, and the complete nucleotide sequence of the S. downei dex was determined. An open reading frame (ORF) of dex was 3,891 bp long. It encoded a dextranase protein (Dex) consisting of 1,297 amino acids with a molecular mass of 139,743 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.49. The deduced amino acid sequence of S. downei Dex had homology to those of S. sobrinus, S. mutans and S. salivanus Dex in the conserved region (made of about 540 amino acid residues). DNA hybridization analysis showed that a dex DNA probe of S. downei hybridized to the chromosomal DNA of S. sobrinus as well as that of S. downei, but did not to other species of mutans streptococci. The C terminus of the S. downei Dex had a membrane-anchor region which has been reported as a common structure of C termini of both the S. mutans and S. sobrinus Dex. The recombinant plasmid which harbored the dex ORF of S. downei produced a recombinant Dex enzyme in Escherichia coli cells. The analysis of the recombinant enzyme on SDS-PAGE containing blue dextran showed multiple active forms as well as dextranases of S. mutans, S. sobrinus and S. salivarius.
TI  - Kappacin, a novel antibacterial peptide from bovine milk.
AB  - Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a heterogeneous C-terminal fragment (residues 106 to 169) of bovine milk kappa-casein composed of glycosylated and phosphorylated forms of different genetic variants. We have demonstrated that CMP has growth-inhibitory activity against the oral opportunistic pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis and against Escherichia coli. CMP was fractionated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and each fraction was tested for activity against S. mutans in a 96-well-plate broth assay. Fractions were characterized by N-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. The active form of CMP was shown to be the nonglycosylated, phosphorylated kappa-casein (residues 106 to 169) [kappa-casein(106--169)], which we have designated kappacin. Endoproteinase Glu-C was used to hydrolyze CMP, and the generated peptides were separated using RP-HPLC and gel filtration-HPLC and then tested for activity against S. mutans. The peptide Ser(P)(149)kappa-casein-A(138--158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase Glu-C digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide Ser(P)(149)kappa-casein-A(138--158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart kappa-casein-A(138--158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. The synthetic Ser(P)(149) kappa-casein-A(138--158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against S. mutans (MIC, 59 microg/ml [26 microM]). The nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity.
TI  - Facilitated intranasal induction of mucosal and systemic immunity to mutans streptococcal glucosyltransferase peptide vaccines.
AB  - Synthetic peptide vaccines which are derived from functional domains of Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases (GTF) have been shown to induce protective immunity in Sprague-Dawley rats after subcutaneous injection in the salivary gland region. Since mucosal induction of salivary immunity would be preferable in humans, we explored methods to induce mucosal antibody in the rat to the GTF peptide vaccines HDS and HDS-GLU after intranasal administration. Several methods of facilitation of the immune response were studied: the incorporation of peptides in bioadhesive poly(D,L-lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) microparticles, the use of monoepitopic (HDS) or diepitopic (HDS-GLU) peptide constructs, or the use of mucosal adjuvants. Salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses were not detected after intranasal administration of diepitopic HDS-GLU peptide constructs in alum or after incorporation into PLGA microparticles. However, significant primary and secondary salivary IgA and serum IgG antibody responses to HDS were induced in all rats when cholera holotoxin (CT) or a detoxified mutant Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (R192G LT) were intranasally administered with HDS peptide constructs in PLGA. Coadministration of LT with HDS resulted in predominantly IgG2a responses in the serum, while coadministration with CT resulted in significant IgG1 and IgG2a responses to HDS. Serum IgG antibody, which was induced to the HDS peptide construct by coadministration with these adjuvants, also bound intact mutans streptococcal GTF in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and inhibited its enzymatic activity. Thus, immune responses which are potentially protective for dental caries can be induced to peptide-based GTF vaccines after mucosal administration if combined with the CT or LT R192G mucosal adjuvant.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Quaternary structure and metal ion requirement of family II pyrophosphatases from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Pyrophosphatase (PPase) from Bacillus subtilis has recently been found to be the  first example of a family II soluble PPase with a unique requirement for Mn2+. In the present work, we cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli putative genes for two more family II PPases (from Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus gordonii), isolated the recombinant proteins, and showed them to be highly specific and active PPases (catalytic constants of 1700-3300 s(-)1 at 25 degrees C in comparison with 200-400 s(-)1 for family I). All three family II PPases were found to be dimeric manganese metalloenzymes, dissociating into much less active monomers upon removal of Mn2+. The dimers were found to have one high affinity manganese-specific site (K(d) of 0.2-3 nm for Mn2+ and 10-80 microm for Mg2+) and two or three moderate affinity sites (K(d) approximately 1 mm for both cations) per subunit. Mn2+ binding to the high affinity site, which occurs with a half-time of less than 10 s at 1.5 mm Mn2+, dramatically shifts the monomer <--> dimer equilibrium in the direction of the dimer, further activates the dimer, and allows substantial activity (60-180 s(-)1) against calcium pyrophosphate, a potent inhibitor of family I PPases.
TI  - Construction of a new integration vector for use in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A new integration vector, pBGK, was constructed for delivery of heterologous DNA  into the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans. A kanamycin resistance element (OmegaKm), which is flanked by transcriptional and translational terminators and which is selectable in both Escherichia coli and streptococci, was inserted into a 2.4-kb EcoRI fragment carrying the S. mutans gtfA gene. A unique SmaI site flanking OmegaKm is available for cloning of promoter:reporter gene fusions or foreign genes, which can then be integrated into the S. mutans chromosome by allelic exchange with the gtfA gene. The vector was used to analyze the activity of an S. mutans promoter by fusing it to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The reporter fusions could readily be cloned into the vector at a unique SmaI site and the vector and passenger DNA were stable in E. coli. DNAs flanked by gtfA sequees integrated efficiently into the chromosome of S. mutans and were stably maintained in the absence of selective pressure. Expression levels of the reporter gene were consistent regardless of orientation or repeated subculturing.
TI  - Characterization of the sat operon in Streptococcus mutans: evidence for a role of Ffh in acid tolerance.
AB  - An essential protein translocation pathway in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis involves the signal recognition particle (SRP), of which the 54-kDa homolog (Ffh) is an essential component. In a previous study, we found that a transposon insertion in the ylxM-ffh intergenic region of the designated secretion and acid tolerance (sat) operon of Streptococcus mutans resulted in an acid-sensitive phenotype. In the present study, we further characterized this genomic region in S. mutans after construction of bona fide sat operon mutants and confirmed the role of the SRP pathway in acid resistance. Northern blot and primer extension analyses identified an acid-inducible promoter upstream of ylxM that was responsible for upregulating the coordinate expression of all five genes of the sat operon when cells were grown at acid pH. Two constitutive promoters, one immediately upstream of satD and one just 3' to the acid-inducible promoter, were also identified. Except for Ffh, the functions of the sat operon gene products are unknown. SatC, SatD, and SatE have no homology to proteins with known functions, although YlxM may function as a transcriptional regulator linked to genes encoding SRP pathway proteins. Nonpolar mutations created in each of the five genes of the sat locus resulted in viable mutants. Most striking, however, was the finding that a mutation in ffh did not result in loss of cell viability, as is the case in all other microbial species in which this pathway has been described. This mutant also lacked immunologically detectable Ffh and was severely affected in resistance to acid. Complementation of the mutation resulted in restoration of acid tolerance and reappearance of cytoplasmic Ffh. These data provide evidence that the SRP pathway plays an important role in acid tolerance in S. mutans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Streblus asper leaf extract.
AB  - Bactericidal activity was found in the 50% ethanol (v/v) extract of Streblus asper leaves. The extract possessed a selective bactericidal activity towards Streptococcus, especially to Streptococcus mutans which has been shown to be strongly associated with dental caries. The extract had no effect on cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus coagulase positive, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia pseudomeallei and Candida albicans. The minimum growth inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of S. asper extract against 10(8) CFU/mL of S. mutans was 2 mg/mL. The active compound is partially polar, partially heat labile, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulphate, and possesses a molecular weight larger than 10 000 Da. The potential for using S. asper extract as a natural product for controlling dental caries is discussed.
TI  - Induction of protective immunity against Streptococcus mutans colonization after  mucosal immunization with attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing an S. mutans adhesin under the control of in vivo-inducible nirB promoter.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the saliva-binding region (SBR) of the Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II adhesin, either alone or linked with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin A2 and B subunits (CTA2/B) and under the control of the anaerobically inducible nirB promoter, in inducing a protective immune response against S. mutans infection. BALB/c mice were immunized by either the intranasal or the intragastric route with a single dose of 10(9) or 10(10) Salmonella CFU, respectively. The Salmonella vaccine strain expressing an unrelated antigen (fragment C of tetanus toxin [TetC]) was also used for immunization as a control. Samples of serum and secretion (saliva and vaginal washes) were collected prior to and following immunization and assessed for antibody activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-SBR antibodies were detected in the serum and saliva of experimental animals by week 3 after immunization. A booster immunization at week 17 after the initial immunization resulted in enhanced immune responses to the SBR. The serum immunoglobulin G subclass profiles were indicative of T helper type 1 responses against both the vector and the SBR antigen. To determine the effectiveness of these responses on the protection against S. mutans infection, mice were challenged after the second immunization with a virulent strain of S. mutans which was resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. Prior to the challenge, mice were treated for 5 days with tetracycline, erythromycin, and penicillin. S. mutans was initially recovered from all of the challenged mice. This bacterium persisted at high levels for at least 5 weeks in control TetC-immunized or nonimmunized mice despite the reappearance of indigenous oral organisms. However, mice immunized with Salmonella clones expressing SBR or SBR-CTA2/B demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of S. mutans present in plaque compared to the control groups. These results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the Salmonella vector in delivering the SBR antigen for the induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses to SBR. Furthermore, the induction of a salivary anti-SBR response corresponded with protection against S. mutans colonization of tooth surfaces.
TI  - Bovine milk antibodies for health.
AB  - The immunoglobulins of bovine colostrum provide the major antimicrobial protection against microbial infections and confer a passive immunity to the newborn calf until its own immune system matures. The concentration in colostrum of specific antibodies against pathogens can be raised by immunising cows with these pathogens or their antigens. Immune milk products are preparations made of such hyperimmune colostrum or antibodies enriched from it. These preparations can be used to give effective specific protection against different enteric diseases in calves and suckling pigs. Colostral immunoglobulin supplements designed for farm animals are commercially available in many countries. Also, some immune milk products containing specific antibodies against certain pathogens have been launched on the market. A number of clinical studies are currently in progress to evaluate the efficacy of immune milks in the prevention and treatment of various human infections, including those caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. Bovine colostrum-based immune milk products have proven effective in prophylaxis against various infectious diseases in humans. Good results have been obtained with products targeted against rotavirus, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus mutans, Cryptosporidium parvum and Helicobacter pylori. Some successful attempts have been made to use immune milk in balancing gastrointestinal microbial flora. Immune milk products are promising examples of health-promoting functional foods, or nutraceuticals. This review summarises the recent progress in the development of these products and evaluates their potential as dietary supplements and in clinical nutrition.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
AB  - Two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (HRPs) in human parotid saliva. The results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of HRPs against Streptococcus mutans MT6R, but also showed for the first time that HRPs were effectively antibacterial to Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ML-35p and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Among HRPs, HRP3, HRP5 and HRP6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against S. mutans, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, whereas HRP1 was only effective against E. coli. S. sanguis was resistant to the action of HRPs. These results suggest that HRPs are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Survival rate of microbes after freeze-drying and long-term storage.
AB  - The survival rates of 10 species of microorganisms were investigated after freeze-drying and preserving in a vacuum at 5 degrees C. The survival rates varied with species. The survival rates immediately after freeze-drying were different among yeast, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria, and the change in the 10-year survival rate was species-specific. The survival rate of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was about 10% immediately after drying, and the rate did not decrease significantly during the 10-year storage period. Survival rates after the drying of gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Brevibacterium flavum, B. lactofermentum, Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum, C. gultamicum, and Streptococcus mutans, were around 80%. The survival rate of Brevibacterium and Corynebacterium did not decrease greatly during the storage period, whereas the rate of S. mutans decreased to about 20% after 10 years. Survival rates after the drying of gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Serratia marcescens, and Alcaligenes faecalis, were around 50%. The survival rate decreased for the first 5 years and then stabilized to around 10% thereafter.
TI  - Xylitol disturbs protein synthesis, including the expression of HSP-70 and HSP-60, in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Xylitol, a natural sugar alcohol and a caries-preventive carbohydrate sweetener,  inhibits xylitol-sensitive wild-type Streptococcus mutans but also selects for its natural xylitol-resistant mutants. The aim of the work was to verify the influence of xylitol on heat shock proteins HSP-60 (GroEL-like) and HSP-70 (DnaK-like) in xylitol-sensitive and xylitol-resistant strains. Cells from fresh isolate S. mutans 123.1 were grown at 37 degrees C and constant pH 7.0. The cell culture was stressed by raising the temperature to 43 degrees C or adding xylitol (4% final). Cell proteins labeled with a cocktail of 14C-amino acids were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography whereas HSP-60 and HSP-70 were visualized using Western immunoblotting. In both xylitol-sensitive and xylitol-resistant strains, heat stress was associated with an increase of both HSP-60 (63 kDa) and HSP-70 (71 kDa) and a decrease in the intensity of a number of other protein bands compared with cells maintained at 37 degrees C. Exposure to xylitol but not to other polyols induced a decrease of both these heat shock proteins in the xylitol-sensitive strain but did not modify them in the xylitol-resistant mutant. It also decreased all protein bands above 60 kDa together with a 53 kDa protein and increased the amount of 57-, 50- and 40-kDa proteins in the xylitol-sensitive strain whereas the proteins of the xylitol-resistant strain remained unchanged. The results suggest that xylitol is a strong metabolic inhibitor that disturbs protein synthesis and reduces the expression of HSP-70 and HSP-60 proteins in the wild-type xylitol-sensitive S. mutans but not in the xylitol-resistant natural mutant strain.
TI  - Comparative study of new alpha-galactosidases in transglycosylation reactions.
AB  - We have studied the potential of several newly cloned alpha-galactosidases to catalyze the regioselective synthesis of disaccharides using 4-nitrophenylgalactoside as a donor. The kinetics of the reactions were followed by in situ NMR spectroscopy. The following thermophilic enzymes have been tested: Aga A and an isoenzyme Aga B obtained from the strain KVE39 and Aga 285 from the strain IT285 of Bacillus stearothermophilus; Aga T is an alpha-galactosidase from Thermus brockianus (strain IT360). Two other non-thermophilic alpha-galactosidases have also been evaluated: Aga 1 (Streptococcus mutans, strain Ingbritt) and Raf A (Escherichia coli, strain D1021). For all of the enzymes studied, high regioselectivity was observed leading to two (1 --> 6)-disaccharides: 4-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1--> 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and methyl alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1--> 6)-alpha-D-galactopyranoside, which were obtained in 54% (Aga B) and 20% (Aga T) yields, respectively.
TI  - A novel IS-like element frequently inserted in a putative virulence regulator in  bovine mastitis isolates of Streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a Lancefield group C streptococcus, is commonly isolated from bovine mastitis. We recently identified a putative regulon in two S. dysgalactiae strains, 8215 and Epi9, consisting of two consecutive genes, dmg and dem, coding for a possible regulatory protein and an M-like protein with fibrinogen- and IgG-binding-properties, respectively. During these studies a short sequence homologous to an IS element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene of strain 8215. The present investigation describes the complete sequence of this IS-like element, named ISSdy1, which consists of 1218 bp and contains two ORFs, flanked by imperfect repeats. The nucleotide sequence of the IS-like element shows 82% identity to the previously reported sequence of IS199 from Streptococcus mutans V403. The deduced amino acid sequences of the ORFs also revealed high homology to transposases from IS elements in Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Shigella dysenteriae, all belonging to the IS3 family. We studied the distribution of ISSdy1 in 57 S. dysgalactiae isolates using PCR analysis with specific primers derived from the IS element. Ninety-eight percent of the isolates contained the ISSdy1 element. Surprisingly, in the majority of studied strains a copy of the IS-like element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene, a putative virulence regulator.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  - A rosemary extract commercially exploited (Oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC of the ethanolic solution was 1% for Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for Streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for Bacillus cereus. It slowed the growth of Penicillium roquefortii and Botrytis cinerea. Up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Cryptococcus laurentii. Antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. The MIC was reduced by low pH, high NaCl contents, and low temperatures. Low pH and high NaCl concentration had a synergistic effect on the MIC of the rosemary extract for S. aureus. Lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. The inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees C). The natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. The antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.
TI  - High-level expression of a truncated wall-associated protein A from the dental cariogenic Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans plays a primary role in the formation of dental caries. Previously, in our laboratory, an S. mutans genomic library was prepared, and the wapA gene was cloned into the shuttle vector, pSA4/4B2. To generate overexpression of wapA and to facilitate efficient purification of the WapA protein for use as an immunogen, an expression vector with the strong tac promoter was used. In order to answer questions regarding the optimization of solubility and expression based on gene size or the hydrophobicity of the protein product, 12 truncated constructs of the wapA gene were prepared using PCR. The truncated products were subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector and expressed in E. coli BL21. The fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by analysis with anti-GST and anti-WapA antibodies. Our study suggests that abrogation of the wapA promoter is necessary for expression of this gene in this expression system. Deletion of the signal peptide and the hydrophobic C terminus of WapA increased expression compared with the full-length construct, and truncation at the protease cleavage site of the C-terminal region greatly increased the stability of the protein without a loss in reactivity with the anti-WapA antibody. Western immunoblot analysis with anti-WapA antiserum clearly showed that the majority of the epitopes of the GST-WapA fusions are located in the N-terminal region of WapA. The immunogenicity of the various WapA fusion products is being examined in mice and rats to further map the immunologically dominant regions of the protein. This method effectively increased the expression of WapA and should contribute to the further understanding of gene expression of E. coli, as well as aid in the characterization of this protein for future immunologic evaluation.
TI  - Effect of static magnetic fields on bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Biological effect of static magnetic field was investigated by using ferrite magnets to conduct a magnetic field exposure experiment on three species of bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The effects were evaluated by culturing the bacteria and determining their growth rate, the maximum numbers of bacteria, and [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The results showed that the ferrite magnet caused strength-dependent decreases in the growth rate and growth maximum number of bacteria for S. mutans and S. aureus when cultured under anaerobic conditions, but that their growth was not inhibited under aerobic conditions. In addition, [3H]-thymidine was added after culturing each of the species of bacteria for 18 h. After that, culture was continued until 24 h, and changes in [3H]-thymidine incorporation were investigated. But no effect of the magnetic fields was detected. These findings suggested that oxygen related to growth the cases of S. mutans, S. aureus. However, no growth effects were detected on E. coli cultures.
TI  - A novel antibacterial agent derived from the C-terminal domain of streptococcus mutans GTP-binding protein.
AB  - A decapeptide, P1, homologous to part of the Streptococcus mutans G-protein (SGP) and the Escherichia coli Era protein, was synthesized and examined for growth-inhibitory effects. When P1 10 mg/L was added to E. coli DH5, the viability of the cells was reduced by 13%. Addition of lauric acid enhanced the bactericidal effects of P1 (68% killing in the presence of P1 plus lauric acid). Similar enhancements were observed for mono lauroyl-rac-glycerol (MLG) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). In cultures treated with both P1 and MLG, there were more elongated cells than in cultures treated with detergent or peptide alone. As with E. coli, the bactericidal effects of P1 on S. mutans were significantly enhanced in the presence of the detergent lauric acid. The combination of the two effectors produced >90% killing of S. mutans. Likewise, the combined action of P1 plus lauric acid reduced the viability of Listeria monocytogenes. P1 did not appear to be toxic to human gingival epithelial cells when added at concentrations < or = 1000 mg/L. Therefore, P1 has properties which could allow it to be used as an antibacterial agent.
TI  - The mannitol-specific enzyme II (mtlA) gene and the mtlR gene of the PTS of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) is widely found among Gram-positive bacteria. It is the major source of carbohydrate transport in the dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans. The transported carbohydrates are fermented to produce large amounts of lactic acid which initiates dental caries. The authors have isolated the S. mutans gene for the mannitol-specific Enzyme II (EII) component of the PTS, mtlA, and the adjacent mtlR gene, which is located in the same operon. The mtlR gene is located between mtlA and the genes mtlF and mtlD. The nucleotide sequence of the mtlA and mtlR loci has been determined. The deduced mtlA gene product of S. mutans consists of 589 amino acids with a molecular mass of 62.0 kDa. It exhibits similarity with the mtlA gene products from other organisms. However, the similarity between these proteins is generally restricted to the 470 amino-terminal residues of the S. mutans protein. This region would correspond to the EIICB domains of the PTS. The authors have previously shown that the S. mutans mtlF gene product exhibits 76.6% similarity to the carboxyl-terminal 143 amino acids of the Escherichia coli mtlA product and that the mtlF gene encodes the EIIA domain of the PTS. Thus, the genes that encode the EIICB and the EIIA domains are separated by approximately 2250 bp. In many organisms, all of the EII domains may be fused together to form one molecule. The fact that these domains are separated by this distance in S. mutans supports the hypothesis that various functional domains of the PTS have been rearranged during evolution. The sequence of the 119 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the S. mutans mtlA gene product also displays homology to the carboxyl-terminal end of the EIIB domain of various mannitol PTSs. Thus, this domain may have been duplicated in S. mutans during evolution of the operon. The mtlR gene is located in the same operon structure as mtlA but these loci are separated by an intragenic space. The precise 5' end of the mtlR locus cannot be determined either by in vitro transcription-translation assays or based upon nucleotide sequence analysis because of the apparent lack of a ribosome-binding site preceding the gene. The deduced mtlR gene product, which consists of approximately 650 amino acids with a molecular mass of 75.3 kDa, exhibits limited similarity to several potential transcriptional regulators. However, the exact function of this locus is currently unknown.
TI  - A novel beta-glucoside-specific PTS locus from Streptococcus mutans that is not inhibited by glucose.
AB  - A regulon from Streptococcus mutans that plays a role in the utilization of beta-glucosides has been isolated, sequenced and subjected to sequence analysis. This regulon encodes a beta-glucoside-specific Enzyme II (EII) component (bglP) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) and a phospho-beta-glucosidase (bglA) which is responsible for the breakdown of the phospho-beta-glucosides within the cell. Both the bglP and bglA gene products have significant similarity with proteins that have similar functions from Clostridium longisporum, Listeria monocytogenes, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, Klebsellia oxytoca and Bacillus subtilis. The potential functions of the BglP and BglA proteins are supported by phenotypic data from both S. mutans and E. coli. A chromosomal deletion in S. mutans spanning the bglP and bglA genes resulted in a strain that was unable to hydrolyse the beta-glucoside aesculin in the presence of glucose. When glucose was removed from the medium, the deletion strain regained the ability to break down aesculin. These data suggest that S. mutans possesses an alternative mechanism from the one described in this report for breaking down beta-glucosides. This second mechanism was repressed by glucose while the regulon described here was not. Complementation studies in E. coli CC118 also suggest a potential role for this regulon in the utilization of other beta-glucosides. When a plasmid containing the 8 kb beta-glucoside-specific regulon was transformed into E. coli CC118, the transformed strain was able to break down the beta-glucoside arbutin.
TI  - Role of the dpr product in oxygen tolerance in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We have previously identified and characterized the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase of Streptococcus mutans, which consists of two components, Nox-1 and AhpC. Deletion of both nox-1 and ahpC had no effect on the sensitivity of S. mutans to cumene hydroperoxide or H(2)O(2), implying that the existence of another antioxidant system(s) independent of the Nox-1-AhpC system compensates for the deficiency. Here, a new antioxidant gene (dpr for Dps-like peroxide resistance gene) was isolated from the S. mutans chromosome by its ability to complement an ahpCF deletion mutant of Escherichia coli with a tert-butyl hydroperoxide-hypersensitive phenotype. The dpr gene complemented the defect in peroxidase activity caused by the deletion of nox-1 and ahpC in S. mutans. Under aerobic conditions, the dpr disruption mutant carrying a spectinomycin resistance gene (dpr::Spc(r) mutant) grew as well as wild-type S. mutans in liquid medium. However, the dpr::Spc(r) mutant could not form colonies on an agar plate under air. In addition, neither the dpr::Spc(r) ahpC::Em(r)::nox-1 triple mutant nor the dpr::Spc(r) sod::Em(r) double mutant was able to grow aerobically in liquid medium. The 20-kDa dpr gene product Dpr is an iron-binding protein. Synthesis of Dpr was induced by exposure of S. mutans cells to air. We propose a mechanism by which Dpr confers aerotolerance on S. mutans.
TI  - The gene encoding IIAB(Man)L in Streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic IIAB protein, called IIAB(Man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. This paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the specific components of the mannose-PTS of Streptococcus salivarius. The man operon was composed of four genes, manL, manM, manN and manO. These genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (Pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mRNA that contained a 5'-UTR (untranslated region). The predicted manL gene product encoded a 35.5 kDa protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the IIA and IIB phosphorylation sites already determined from purified S. salivarius IIAB(Man)L. Expression of manL in Escherichia coli generated a 35 kDa protein that reacted with anti-IIAB(Man)L antibodies. The predicted ManM protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kDa. ManM had similarity with IIC domains of the mannose-EII family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-IIC proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. From multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified IIC(Man) signature is proposed: GX3G[DNH]X3G[LIVM]2XG2[STL][LT][EQ]. The deduced product of manN was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. The ManN protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the IID domains of the mannose-EII family. manO encoded a 13.7 kDa protein. This gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a promoter located in the manN-manO intergenic region. A search of current databases revealed the presence of IIAB(Man)L, ManM, ManN and ManO orthologues in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. This work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose PTS in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (ManO) within the man operon.
TI  - Epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  - Accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. In subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gram-negative bacteria increases. As the gingival junctional epithelium (JE) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of LTAs (from Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguis) and LPSs (from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (HaCaT and ERM) and a culture model for human JE. The cells were exposed to the LTAs or LPSs (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. None of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the JE cultures. However, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in all cultures treated with LTAs. In contrast, LPSs showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. This suggests that LPSs, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. However, the LTAs appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal JE and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Construction and characterization of a Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium clone expressing a salivary adhesin of Streptococcus mutans under control of the anaerobically inducible nirB promoter.
AB  - Attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has been used for targeted delivery of recombinant antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. One potential problem associated with this vaccine approach is the likelihood of in vivo instability of the plasmid constructs caused by constitutive hyperexpression of the heterologous immunogen. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize an expression system encoding the saliva-binding region (SBR) of Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II adhesin, either alone or linked with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin A2/B subunits (CTA2/B), under the control of the inducible nirB promoter. This promoter is activated in an anaerobic environment and within macrophages, which are the primary antigen-presenting cells involved in phagocytosis and processing of Salmonella. The gene encoding the chimeric SBR-CTA2/B was amplified by PCR using primers containing appropriate restriction sites for subcloning into pTETnirB, which contains the nirB promoter. The resulting plasmid was introduced into serovar Typhimurium by electroporation. Production of the SBR-CTA2/B chimeric protein under anaerobic conditions was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of whole-cell lysates on plates coated with G(M1) ganglioside and developed with antibodies to SBR. Similar procedures were followed for cloning the gene encoding SBR in serovar Typhimurium under nirB control. Anaerobic expression of SBR was confirmed by Western blotting of whole-cell lysates probed with anti-SBR antibodies. The resulting serovar Typhimurium strains were administered by either the oral or the intranasal route to mice, and colonization was assessed by microbiologic analysis of dissociated spleens, Peyer's patches (PP), and nasal tissues. High numbers of the recombinant strains persisted in PP and spleen for at least 21 days following oral challenge. A single intranasal administration of the Salmonella clones to mice also resulted in the colonization of the nasal tissues by the recombinant bacteria. Salmonellae were recovered from nasal lymphoid tissues, superficial lymph nodes, internal jugular lymph nodes, PP, and spleens of mice for at least 21 days after challenge. This study provides quantitative evidence for colonization by Salmonella strains expressing a recombinant protein under the control of the inducible nirB promoter in PP or nasal tissues following a single oral or nasal administration of the bacteria, respectively.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans H2O2-forming NADH oxidase is an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase protein.
AB  - Nox-1 from Streptococcus mutans, the bacteria which cause dental caries, was previously identified as an H2O2-forming reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase. Nox-1 is homologous with the flavoprotein component, AhpF, of Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. A partial open reading frame upstream of nox1, homologous with the other (peroxidase) component, ahpC, from the S. typhimurium system, was also identified. We report here the complete sequence of S. mutans ahpC. Analyses of purified AhpC together with Nox-1 have verified that these proteins act as a cysteine-based peroxidase system in S. mutans, catalyzing the NADH-dependent reduction of organic hydroperoxides or H2O2 to their respective alcohols and/or H2O. These proteins also catalyze the four-electron reduction of O2 to H2O2, clarifying the role of Nox-1 as a protective protein against oxygen toxicity. Major differences between Nox-1 and AhpF include: (i) the absolute specificity of Nox-1 for NADH; (ii) lower amounts of flavin semiquinone and a more prominent FADH2 to NAD+ charge transfer absorbance band stabilized by Nox-1; and (iii) even higher redox potentials of disulfide centers relative to flavin for Nox-1. Although Nox-1 and AhpC from S. mutans were shown to play a protective role against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli, the lack of a significant effect on deletion of these genes from S. mutans suggests the presence of additional antioxidant proteins in these bacteria.
TI  - The recombinant N-terminal region of human salivary mucin MG2 (MUC7) contains a binding domain for oral Streptococci and exhibits candidacidal activity.
AB  - MG2 (the MUC7 gene product) is a low-molecular-mass mucin found in human submandibular/sublingual secretions. This mucin is believed to agglutinate a variety of microbes and thus is considered an important component of the non-immune host defence system in the oral cavity. We have shown that MUC7 can bind to cariogenic strains of Streptococcus mutans and that this binding requires a structural determinant in the N-terminal region. In the present study an expression construct, pNMuc7, encoding the N-terminal 144 amino acids of MUC7 was generated, and the recombinant protein rNMUC7 was expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified rNMUC7 was characterized and the binding of this protein to oral bacteria was investigated in an established assay. The results showed that the recombinant protein bound to S. mutans ATCC 25175 and ATCC 33402, and that alkylation of the two cysteine residues (Cys(45) and Cys(50)) resulted in the complete loss of bacterial binding. This suggests that binding of MUC7 to S. mutans occurs between the N-terminal region of the mucin molecule and the bacterial surface, and that this interaction is dependent on a cysteine-containing domain within this region of MUC7. In addition, the killing activity of rNMUC7 was compared with that of the candidacidal salivary protein histatin 5 in an established Candida albicans (ATCC 44505) blastoconidia killing assay. It was found that the LD(50) values of rNMUC7 and histatin 5 were comparable, and that the recombinant protein displayed significant killing activity at the physiological concentration range of MUC7 in whole saliva. This study is the first to show that the N-terminal region of MUC7 contains a structural determinant for bacterial binding and that this region exhibits candidacidal activity.
TI  - The N-terminal region of the Escherichia coli WecA (Rfe) protein, containing three predicted transmembrane helices, is required for function but not for membrane insertion.
AB  - The correct site for translation initiation for Escherichia coli WecA (Rfe), presumably involved in catalyzing the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate to undecaprenylphosphate, was determined by using its FLAG-tagged derivatives. The N-terminal region containing three predicted transmembrane helices was found to be necessary for function but not for membrane localization of this protein.
TI  - Tn917-lac mutagenesis of Streptococcus mutans to identify environmentally regulated genes.
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated successful Tn917 mutagenesis of the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans using pTV1-OK (Km(r), repATs), a temperature conditional replicative delivery vector carrying a lactococcal pWVO1Ts backbone. In this report we describe the construction and utilization of pTV32-OK, a plasmid harboring Tn917-lac (em(r), beta-gal(+)) that was employed to isolate transcriptional fusions of the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene with streptococcal promoters in S. mutans strain NG8. Tn917-lac transposition occurred at a frequency of ca. 10(-6) with 20% of the resultant em(r) clones displaying varying levels of lacZ expression. Tn917-lac mutants that expressed beta-galactosidase activity under growth conditions of glucose limitation, acidic pH, 35 mM NaCl, and elevated (42 degrees C) temperature were isolated. Further characterization of one of the mutants with increased beta-gal activity under glucose limitation, strain AS42, revealed maximal activity in batch culture in stationary phase after glucose depletion. The beta-gal activity of AS42 also was found to be repressed 3-fold in medium containing 2% glucose relative to measured activity from cells suspended in the same medium containing no glucose. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that AS42 had a 30% lower growth yield than the parent strain NG8 when grown in pH 5 medium. Sequence analysis of the region harboring the transposon revealed that the lacZ fusion occurred near the 3'-end of a gene encoding a homolog of an ATP binding protein from a family of Gram-positive ABC transporters. These findings demonstrate that Tn917-lac mutagenesis can be used to identify environmentally regulated genes in S. mutans and possibly in other medically relevant streptococcal species.
TI  - Characterization of the gtfB and gtfC promoters from Streptococcus mutans GS-5.
AB  - We have characterized the promoter regions of the gtfB and gtfC genes from Streptococcus mutans GS-5. Using a plasmid-based reporter system, we discovered that the gtfC promoter is an order of magnitude stronger than the gtfB promoter. In addition, we found that a variety of growth conditions failed to affect or discriminate between the expression of the two promoters. Only during the various phases of growth could we demonstrate significant changes in expression. We conclude that gtfB and gtfC promoters are coordinately expressed.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the mucosal adjuvanticity of the type II heat-labile enterotoxins LT-IIa and LT-IIb.
AB  - Cholera toxin (CT) and the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT-I) are members of the serogroup I heat-labile enterotoxins (HLT) and can serve as systemic and mucosal adjuvants. However, information is lacking with respect to the structurally related but antigenically distinct serogroup II HLT, LT-IIa and LT-IIb, which have different binding specificities for ganglioside receptors. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of LT-IIa and LT-IIb as mucosal adjuvants in comparison to the prototypical type I HLT, CT. BALB/c mice were immunized by the intranasal (i.n.) route with the surface protein adhesin AgI/II of Streptococcus mutans alone or supplemented with an adjuvant amount of CT, LT-IIa, or LT-IIb. Antigen-specific antibody responses in saliva, vaginal wash, and plasma were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mice given AgI/II with LT-IIa or LT-IIb by the i.n. route had significantly higher mucosal and systemic antibody responses than mice immunized with AgI/II alone. Anti-AgI/II immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody activity in saliva and vaginal secretions of mice given AgI/II with LT-IIa or LT-IIb was statistically similar in magnitude to that seen in mice given AgI/II and CT. LT-IIb significantly enhanced the number of AgI/II-specific antibody-secreting cells in the draining superficial cervical lymph nodes compared to LT-IIa and CT. LT-IIb and CT induced significantly higher plasma anti-AgI/II IgG titers compared to LT-IIa. When LT-IIb was used as adjuvant, the proportion of plasma IgG2a relative to IgG1 anti-AgI/II antibody was elevated in contrast to the predominance of IgG1 antibodies promoted by AgI/II alone or when CT or LT-IIa was used. In vitro stimulation of AgI/II-specific cells from the superficial lymph nodes and spleen revealed that LT-IIa and LT-IIb induced secretion of interleukin-4 and significantly higher levels of gamma interferon compared to CT. These results demonstrate that the type II HLT LT-IIa and LT-IIb exhibit potent and distinct adjuvant properties for stimulating immune responses to a noncoupled protein immunogen after mucosal immunization.
TI  - Protective immunity against Streptococcus mutans infection in mice after intranasal immunization with the glucan-binding region of S. mutans glucosyltransferase.
AB  - Here we present the construction and characterization of a chimeric vaccine protein combining the glucan-binding domain (GLU) of the gtfB-encoded water-insoluble glucan-synthesizing glucosyltransferase enzyme (GTF-I) from Streptococcus mutans and thioredoxin from Escherichia coli, which increases the solubility of coexpressed recombinant proteins and stimulates proliferation of murine T cells. The protective potential of intranasal (i.n.) immunization with this chimeric immunogen was compared to that of the GLU polypeptide alone in a mouse infection model. Both immunogens were able to induce statistically significant mucosal (salivary and vaginal) and serum responses (P < 0.01) which were sustained to the end of the study (experimental day 100). Following infection with S. mutans, sham-immunized mice maintained high levels of this cariogenic organism ( approximately 60% of the total oral streptococci) for at least 5 weeks. In contrast, animals immunized with the thioredoxin-GLU chimeric protein (Thio-GLU) showed significant reduction (>85%) in S. mutans colonization after 3 weeks (P < 0.05). The animals immunized with GLU alone required 5 weeks to demonstrate significant reduction (>50%) of S. mutans infection (P < 0.05). Evaluation of dental caries activity at the end of the study showed that mice immunized with either Thio-GLU or GLU had significantly fewer carious lesions in the buccal enamel or dentinal surfaces than the sham-immunized animals (P < 0.01). The protective effects against S. mutans colonization and caries activity following i.n. immunization with GLU or Thio-GLU are attributed to the induced salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-GLU responses. Although in general Thio-GLU was not significantly better than GLU alone in stimulating salivary IgA responses and in protection against dental caries, the finding that the GLU polypeptide alone, in the absence of any immunoenhancing agents, is protective against disease offers a promising and safe strategy for the development of a vaccine against caries.
TI  - A protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria derived from hrcA, a unique heat-shock regulatory gene.
AB  - The dnaK operon from Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria with low  G + C DNA content contains additional heat-shock genes, including hrcA. The hrcA gene encodes a transcription factor that negatively regulates heat-shock genes and is uniformly present in all Gram-positive bacteria studied to date. An hrcA homologue is also present in Synechocystis species, Leptospira interrogans, Chlamydia trachomatis, Caulobacter crescentus and Methanococcus jannaschii, organisms that diverged early on from the common ancestor of all Gram-positive bacteria and Proteobacteria, according to 16S rRNA phylogeny. A partial, protein-based phylogenetic tree, derived using amino acid sequence homology of hrcA proteins from Gram-positive bacteria, is presented here, and the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. The location of the hrcA gene and the genome organization of the dnaK operon support the division of all Gram-positive bacteria into three major groups: one group contains high-G + C Gram-positive bacteria, and two others contain low-G + C Gram-positive bacteria. Among the Gram-positive bacteria with low G + C DNA content, the results indicate that there is a close phylogenetic relationship between Bacillus species and Clostridium species on the one hand and between Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus mutans on the other. Streptomyces and Mycobacterium species also exhibited a close relationship. A hierarchical arrangement of Gram-positive bacteria based on HrcA sequences is proposed as an additional refinement of the phylogenetic relationships within this important bacterial group.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - A novel gene required for rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide synthesis in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Gene rgpG is required for biosynthesis of rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP) in Streptococcus mutans. Its deduced amino acid sequence had similarity to WecA, which initiates syntheses of enterobacterial common antigen and some O antigens in Escherichia coli. Gene rgpG complemented a wecA mutation of E. coli, suggesting that rgpG may function similarly in RGP synthesis.
TI  - Functions of two types of NADH oxidases in energy metabolism and oxidative stress of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We have previously identified two distinct NADH oxidases corresponding to H(2)O(2)-forming oxidase (Nox-1) and H(2)O-forming oxidase (Nox-2) induced in Streptococcus mutans. Sequence analyses indicated a strong similarity between Nox-1 and AhpF, the flavoprotein component of Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase; an open reading frame upstream of nox-1 also showed homology to AhpC, the direct peroxide-reducing component of S. typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. To determine their physiological functions in S. mutans, we constructed knockout mutants of Nox-1, Nox-2, and/or the AhpC homologue; we verified that Nox-2 plays an important role in energy metabolism through the regeneration of NAD(+) but Nox-1 contributes negligibly. The Nox-2 mutant exhibited greatly reduced aerobic growth on mannitol, whereas there was no significant effect of aerobiosis on the growth on mannitol of the other strains or growth on glucose of any of the strains. Although the Nox-2 mutants grew well on glucose aerobically, the end products of glucose fermentation by the Nox-2 mutant were substantially shifted to higher ratios of lactic acid to acetic acid compared with wild-type cells. The resistance to cumene hydroperoxide of Escherichia coli TA4315 (ahpCF-defective mutant) transformed with pAN119 containing both nox-1 and ahpC genes was not only restored but enhanced relative to that of E. coli K-12 (parent strain), indicating a clear function for Nox-1 as part of an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase system in vivo in combination with AhpC. Surprisingly, the Nox-1 and/or AhpC deficiency had no effect on the sensitivity of S. mutans to cumene hydroperoxide and H(2)O(2), implying that the existence of some other antioxidant system(s) independent of Nox-1 in S. mutans compensates for the deficiency.
TI  - Enhanced (+)-catechin transglucosylating activity of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 glucosyltransferase-D due to fructose removal.
AB  - The (+)-catechin transglucosylating activities of several glucosyltransferases (GTFs) from the genus Streptococcus were compared. For this purpose, a mixture of four GTFs from Streptococcus sobrinus SL-1 and recombinant GTF-B and GTF-D from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 expressed in Escherichia coli were studied. It was shown that after removal of alpha-glucosidase activity, GTF-D transglucosylated catechin with the highest efficiency. A maximal yield (expressed as the ratio of moles of glucoside formed to moles of catechin initially added) of 90% was observed with 10 mM catechin and 100 mM sucrose (K(m), 13 mM) in 125 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, at 37 degrees C. (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the structures of two catechin glucosides, (+)-catechin-4'-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and (+)-catechin-4',7-O-alpha-di-D-glucopyranoside. Fructose accumulation during glucosyl transfer from sucrose to the acceptor competitively inhibited catechin transglucosylation (K(i), 9.3 mM), whereas glucose did not inhibit catechin transglucosylation. The addition of yeasts was studied in order to minimize fructose inhibition by means of fructose removal. For this purpose, the yeasts Pichia pastoris and the mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae T2-3D were selected because of their inabilities to utilize sucrose. Addition of P. pastoris or S. cerevisiae T2-3D to the standard reaction mixture resulted in a twofold increase in the duration of the maximum GTF-D transglucosylation rate. The addition of the yeasts also stimulated sucrose utilization by GTF-D.
TI  - Stress-induced membrane association of the Streptococcus mutans GTP-binding protein, an essential G protein, and investigation of its physiological role by utilizing an antisense RNA strategy.
AB  - SGP (for Streptococcus GTP-binding protein) is a Streptococcus mutans essential GTPase which has significant sequence identity to the previously identified Escherichia coli Era protein and to numerous other prokaryotic GTPase proteins of unknown function. Recent studies in our laboratory have addressed the possible role of SGP in the stress response of the oral pathogen S. mutans. Here we report that during growth in the early stationary phase, and in response to elevated temperatures or acidic pH, the distribution of SGP between the cytoplasm and the membranes of S. mutans cells varies. Immunoblot analysis of soluble and membrane protein fractions collected from the mid-log and early stationary growth phases of bacterial populations grown at normal temperature (37 degrees C) and at the elevated temperature of 43 degrees C, or at acidic pH, demonstrated that the total amount of SGP increased with the age of the bacterial culture, elevated temperature, or acidic pH. Furthermore, it was established that a substantial amount of SGP is associated with the membrane fraction under stress conditions. In order to investigate the physiological role of SGP, we constructed an S. mutans strain capable of chromosomal sgp antisense RNA expression, which interferes with the normal information processing of the sgp gene. Utilizing this strain, we determined conditions whereby the streptococcal cells can be depleted of SGP, thus avoiding the problem of constructing a conditional lethal system. From the results of measurements of the nucleotide pools extracted from the antisense strain and its isogenic counterpart, we propose that one of the physiological roles of SGP is regulation and modulation of the GTP/GDP ratio under different growth conditions. Moreover, we observed that in SGP-depleted cells the levels of glucan-binding protein A (GbpA) substantially increased, suggesting that GbpA may have stress response-related physiological functions. Finally, the potential applications of the antisense RNA approach that we employed are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the beta-fructofuranosidase gene from Bacillus sp. V230.
AB  - The beta-fructofuranosidase gene (bff) from Bacillus sp. V230 has been cloned in  Escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been analyzed. The product of bff consists of a signal sequence of 32 amino acid (a.a.) residues for secretion and 455 a.a. residues of the extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase. The a.a. sequence of the bff product has similarities with those of the Bacillus subtilis levanscrase (63.7% identity), the Streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase (33.7%), and the Zymomonas mobilis levanscrase and beta-fructofuranosidase (15%).
TI  - Adherence of Staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by an endogenous secreted protein  with broad binding activity.
AB  - A novel mechanism for enhancement of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to host components is described. A secreted protein, Eap (extracellular adherence protein), was purified from the supernatant of S. aureus Newman and found to be able to bind to at least seven plasma proteins, e.g., fibronectin, the alpha-chain of fibrinogen, and prothrombin, and to the surface of S. aureus. Eap bound much less to cells of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, or Escherichia coli. The protein can form oligomeric forms and is able to cause agglutination of S. aureus. Binding of S. aureus to fibroblasts and epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by addition of Eap, presumably due to its affinity both for plasma proteins on the cells and for the bacteria.
TI  - Structure of the enzymatically synthesized fructan inulin.
AB  - Construction, purification and characterization of a fusion protein of maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli and the fructosyltransferase of Streptococcus mutans is described. With the purified protein, in vitro synthesis of inulin was performed. The obtained polysaccharide was characterized by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and static light scattering (SLS) in dilute aqueous and dimethyl sulfoxide solution. For all samples very high molecular weights between 60 x 10(6) and 90 x 10(6) g/mol and a remarkable small polydispersity index of 1.1 have been determined. Small root-mean-square radii of gyration point to a compact conformation in dilute solution. No difference between native and enzymatically synthesized inulin was observed by X-ray powder diffraction and thermoanalysis of solid samples.
TI  - Structure and transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase of a ruminal bacterium, Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The gene (pfl) encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (Pfl) from Streptococcus bovis was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of Pfl was similar to Streptococcus mutans Pfl, and included the conserved regions necessary for free-radical formation and a catalytic site. The Pfl of S. bovis appeared to be a free-radical-containing enzyme because of its dioxygen sensitivity and its amino acid sequence similarity with the Escherichia coli enzyme. The pfl mRNA of S. bovis was approximately 2.3 kb and was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. When cells were grown in batch culture at pH 6.9, the level of pfl transcript increased as the growth phase changed from exponential growth to stationary phase. This result was in constrast to the previous observation that the level of lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) mRNA decreased during the later stages of growth. Continuous culture experiments conducted at pH 6.9 under glucose-limited and ammonia-limited conditions revealed that pfl mRNA was decreased by an excess supply of glucose, as well as by a high growth rate. On the contrary, ldh mRNA increased when excess glucose was supplied and the growth rate was high. The amount of pfl mRNA in cells was lower at pH 4.5 than pH 6.9, whereas the level of ldh mRNA was higher at pH 4.5. This result was consistent with the amounts of Pfl and Ldh in cells and the proportion of formate and lactate produced. These results support the hypothesis that S. bovis regulates Pfl and Ldh synthesis at the transcriptional level in response to growth conditions.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans ffh, a gene encoding a homologue of the 54 kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle, is involved in resistance to acid stress.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus mutans, a bacterial pathogen associated with dental  caries, to tolerate rapid drops in plaque pH (acidurance), is considered an important virulence factor. To study this trait, Tn917 mutants of S. mutans strain JH1005 which display acid sensitivity have been isolated and partially characterized. In this paper, the characterization of one of these mutants, AS17, is reported. Preliminary sequence analysis revealed that the transposon insertion in AS17 occurred in the intergenic region of a two-gene locus which has been named sat for secretion and acid tolerance. This locus displays a high degree of homology to the ylxM-ffh operon of Bacillus subtilis. The sat+ locus was cloned by complementation of a conditional Escherichia coli ffh mutant with an S. mutans genomic library. Sequencing of the complementing clone identified the intact ylxM and ffh genes as well as a partial ORF with homology to the proUlopuAC gene of B. subtilis which encodes the binding protein of the ProU/OpuA osmoregulated glycine betaine transport system. RNA dot blot experiments indicated steady-state levels of ffh mRNA in the mutant that were approximately eightfold lower compared to parental levels. This suggests a partial polar effect of the sat-1::Tn917 mutation on ffh expression. Upon acid shock (pH 5), wild-type ffh mRNA levels were found to increase approximately four- to eightfold compared to unstressed (pH 7.5) levels. Mutant levels remained unaltered under the same conditions. Experiments designed to investigate the origins of the acid-sensitivity of the mutant revealed a lack of an acid-adaptive/tolerance response. Assays of proton-extruding ATPase (H+/ATPase) specific activity measured with purified membranes derived from acid-shocked AS17 showed twofold lower levels compared to the parent strain. Also, AS17 was found to be unable to ferment sorbitol although it was able to grow in glucose and a variety of other sugar substrates. These findings suggest that Ffh may be involved in the maintenance of a functional membrane protein composition during adaptation of S. mutans to changing environmental conditions.
TI  - Surface expression of a protective recombinant pertussis toxin S1 subunit fragment in Streptococcus gordonii.
AB  - In this study, the expression of the Bordetella pertussis S1 subunit was tested in Streptococcus gordonii, a commensal oral bacterium which has the potential to be a live oral vaccine vehicle. The DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal 179 amino acids of the S1 subunit was ligated into the middle part of spaP, the surface protein antigen P1 gene originating from Streptococcus mutans. The resulting construct, carried on the Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector pDL276, was introduced into S. gordonii DL-1 by natural transformation. One of the transformants (RJMIII) produced a 187-kDa protein (the predicted size of the SpaP-S1 fusion protein) which was recognized by both the anti-pertussis toxin (anti-PT) and anti-SpaP antibodies, suggesting that an in-frame fusion had been made. Results from immunogold-electron microscopic studies and cellular fractionation studies showed that the fusion protein was surface localized and was mainly associated with the cell wall of RJMIII, indicating that SpaP was able to direct the fusion protein to the cell surface. A rabbit antiserum raised against heat-killed S. gordonii RJMIII recognized the native S1 subunit of PT in Western blotting and showed a weak neutralization titer to PT by the Chinese hamster ovary cell-clustering assay. BALB/c mice immunized with the heat-killed S. gordonii RJMIII were protected from the toxic effect of PT in the leukocytosis-promoting and histamine sensitization assays. In conclusion, a fragment of the S1 subunit of PT was successfully surface expressed in S. gordonii; the recombinant S1 fragment was found to be immunogenic and could induce protection against the toxic effect of PT in mice.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Camellia sinensis extracts against dental caries.
AB  - Different bacteria were separated from saliva and teeth of cariogenic patients and identified by a variety of morphological and biochemical tests. Extracts of green tea strongly inhibited Escherichia coli, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans. The antibacterial effect of green and black tea extracts were compared with those of amoxicillin, cephradine and eugenol.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a unique inorganic pyrophosphatase from Bacillus subtilis: evidence for a new family of enzymes.
AB  - An open reading frame located in the COTF-TETB intergenic region of Bacillus subtilis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to encode inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase). The isolated enzyme is Mn2+-activated, like the authentic PPase isolated from B. subtilis. Although 13 functionally important active site residues are conserved in all 31 soluble PPase sequences so far identified, only two of them are conserved in B. subtilis PPase. This suggests that B. subtilis PPase represents a new family of soluble PPases (a Bs family), putative members of which were found in Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanococcus jannaschii, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus gordonii.
TI  - A medium-copy-number plasmid for insertional mutagenesis of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We have constructed a plasmid useful for insertional mutagenesis in Streptococcus mutans. The molecule, pSU20Erm, is based on a derivative of pACYC184 known as pSU20. The plasmid described here is approximately 3.7 kb in size and has the following properties: it replicates in Escherichia coli, does not replicate in S. mutans, contains an erythromycin-resistance marker which can be selected in E. coli or the streptococci, contains a multiple cloning site with few restriction sites in the remainder of the molecule, and can be screened on X-Gal-containing medium for the presence of insertions into the multiple cloning site. We have used the plasmid to construct a library of S. mutans DNA in E. coli and show that the clones can be reintegrated into the S. mutans chromosome via homologous recombination, thereby interrupting native genes. The plasmid has been used to clone part of a homologue of the E. coli drpA gene, encoding a global regulatory element for RNA synthesis. Further, we have identified an element closely linked to drpA in S. mutans with high homology to IS861.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the Streptococcus mutans gal operon by the GalR repressor.
AB  - The galactose operon of Streptococcus mutans is transcriptionally regulated by a  repressor protein (GalR) encoded by the galR gene, which is divergently oriented from the structural genes of the gal operon. To study the regulatory function of GalR, we partially purified the protein and examined its DNA binding activity by gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments. The protein specifically bound to the galR-galK intergenic region at an operator sequence, the position of which would suggest that GalR plays a role in the regulation of the gal operon as well as autoregulation. To further examine this hypothesis, transcriptional start sites of the gal operon and the galR gene were determined. Primer extension analysis showed that both promoters overlap the operator, indicating that GalR most likely represses transcription initiation of both promoters. Finally, the results from in vitro binding experiments with potential effector molecules suggest that galactose is a true intracellular inducer of the galactose operon.
TI  - Deletion of the central proline-rich repeat domain results in altered antigenicity and lack of surface expression of the Streptococcus mutans P1 adhesin molecule.
AB  - Members of the family of surface adhesins of oral streptococci, including P1 of Streptococcus mutans, contain two highly conserved repeat domains, one rich in alanine (A region) and the other rich in proline (P region). To assess the contribution of the P region to the biological properties of P1, an internal deletion in spaP was engineered. In addition, the P region was subcloned and expressed as a fusion partner with the maltose binding protein of Escherichia coli and liberated by digestion with factor Xa. Results of Western blot experiments in which recombinant polypeptides were probed with a panel of 11 monoclonal antibodies indicated that the P region is a necessary component of conformational epitopes within the central portion of P1. Antibodies reactive with the P region were detected in a polyclonal rabbit antiserum generated against whole S. mutans cells but not in two rabbit antisera generated against purified P1 (Mr approximately 185,000), suggesting that this domain is immunogenic on the surface of intact bacteria but not as part of a soluble full-length molecule. Finally, transformation of a spaP-negative mutant with a shuttle vector containing an internally deleted spaP lacking P-region DNA resulted in a complete absence of surface-localized P1 and substantially less P1 in sonicated cells compared to the case for the mutant complemented with the full-length gene. These results suggest that the P region is an integral component contributing to the conformation of the central region of P1 and indicate that its presence is necessary for surface expression of the molecule on S. mutans.
TI  - An immunoassay for the detection and quantitative determination of mycothiol.
AB  - Mycothiol (MSH) is a glycosylated derivative of N-acetylcysteine that may have antioxidant functions in mycobacteria and other actinomycetes. To develop a highly specific assay for MSH, we capitalized on the selective binding of thiols to a maleimide residue linked to bovine serum albumin and employed affinity-purified polyclonal antibody and an enzyme-linked secondary antibody for detection. The assay was shown to be specific and to detect MSH at levels as low as 0.1 pmol when conducted in the form of a microtiter plate-based ELISA. A similar, nitrocellulose membrane-based immunoassay was shown to be useful for qualitative detection of MSH-producing bacterial colonies.
TI  - Plasmid maintenance renders bacteria more susceptible to heat stress.
AB  - The presence of shuttle plasmid pTS749 in the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans resulted in growth inhibition under heat stress conditions. This effect was dependent upon the growth stage of the inoculum used to initiate growth. Likewise, the introduction of plasmids containing distinct ori sequences into Escherichia coli also resulted in growth inhibition at elevated temperatures and could be correlated with the plasmid levels within the cells. These results suggest that these plasmids in bacteria render the cells to be more susceptible to heat stress conditions.

TI  - Biological functions of UDP-glucose synthesis in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.9) was isolated from Streptococcus mutans. A cell extract of Escherichia coli expressing the cloned gene exhibited glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity. The enzyme catalyses the conversion of D-glucose 1-phosphate and UTP into UDP-D-glucose. Rabbit antiserum against the serotype-c-specific antigen did not react with autoclaved extracts from mutant cells in which the cloned gene was insertionally inactivated. The glucose content of the cell-wall preparation purified from the mutant was very much lowered, whereas there was no observable decrease in the content of rhamnose. When the mutant strain was grown in an acidic environment, its cell viability was much lower than that of the wild-type. These results suggest that UDP-D-glucose functions not only as an immediate precursor of the serotype-c-specific antigen of S. mutans (as a glucose donor for side-chain formation), but is also important for the organism's viability in environmental conditions of low pH.
TI  - The Streptococcus agalactiae hylB gene encoding hyaluronate lyase: completion of  the sequence and expression analysis.
AB  - We report the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the Streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hylB4755 allele, the first chromosomally-encoded streptococcal hyaluronate lyase gene to be cloned and sequenced completely. This gene lies in a region homologous to that found in S. mutans, between the mutX and rmlB genes, a region involved in the synthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of this organism. Sequencing of hylB4755 revealed a 3216-bp open reading frame that encodes a 121.2-kDa polypeptide possessing a 30-amino acid signal sequence which was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. A recombinant plasmid, pHYB100, containing hylB4755 together with its promoter and terminator was constructed and used to analyze the expression of the gene in Escherichia coli. In Northern hybridization experiments, hylB4755 was found to be transcribed as 3.3-kb monocistronic mRNA from its own promoter which exhibits an extended, sigma70-like 10 consensus sequence. Transcript mapping by primer extension analysis placed the major transcription initiation site leading to the longest transcript 38 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon, ATG. E. coli TG1(pHYB100) efficiently synthesized hyaluronan-cleaving enzyme activity at approximately 7000 working units/109 cells, with lyase activity detectable in all principle cellular locations. Zymography and Western analysis identified functional activity in TG1(pHYB100) to be associated with approximately 118, 110 and 94-kDa polypeptides, with the two low molecular weight species constituting the major components of the enzyme purified from the culture supernatant fluid of S. agalactiae 4755. The 118-kDa form was shown to represent the undegraded mature enzyme, whereas the smaller species are likely to arise from proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal part of the mature protein. The HylB4755 protein showed extensive sequence identity to the homologous enzymes from S. agalactiae 3502 and S. pneumoniae characterized by others but sequence comparisons clearly show that incomplete genes truncated at their 5' ends had been isolated from these two organisms.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical analysis of mutacin 1140, a lantibiotic from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans JH1000 and its derivatives were previously shown (J. D. Hillman, K. P. Johnson, and B. I. Yaphe, Infect. Immun. 44:141-144, 1984) to produce a low-molecular-weight, broad-spectrum bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS). The thermosensitive vector pTV1-OK harboring Tn917 was used to isolate a BLIS-deficient mutant, DM25, and the mutated gene was recovered by shotgun cloning in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis of insert DNA adjacent to Tn917 led to the identification of four open reading frames including two (lanA and lanB) which have substantial homology to the Staphylococcus epidermidis structural gene (epiA) and a modifying enzyme gene (epiB) for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin, respectively. Although the BLIS activity could not be recovered from broth cultures, high yields were obtained from a solid medium consisting of Todd-Hewitt broth containing 0.5% agarose that was stab inoculated with JH1140 (a spontaneous mutant of JH1000 that produces threefold-elevated amounts of activity). Agar could not substitute for agarose. Chloroform extraction of the spent medium produced a fraction which yielded two major bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The faster-migrating band was absent in chloroform extracts of the mutant, DM25. The amino acid sequence of this band was determined by Edman sequencing and mass spectroscopy. The results showed that it is a lantibiotic, which we have named mutacin 1140, and that the sequence corresponded to that deduced from the lanA sequence. We observed a number of similarities of mutacin 1140 to epidermin and an S. mutans lantibiotic, B-Ny266, but it appears to have significant differences in the positions of its thioether bridges. It also has other unique features with regard to its leader sequence and posttranslational modification. A proposed structure for mutacin 1140 is presented.

TI  - Application of the resident plasmid integration technique to construct a strain of Streptococcus godronii able to express the Bacillus circulans cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase gene, and secrete its active gene product.
AB  - A novel transformation technique, resident plasmid integration, for the cloning of foreign DNA in oral streptococci was described recently (T. Shiroza and H.K. Kuramitsu, Plasmid 34 (1995) 85-95. This technique is based on the integration of linearized foreign genes by recombination-proficient bacteria onto a resident plasmid, if an appropriate selection marker is flanked by the same anchor sites present in the resident plasmid. Since the transforming vehicles for this system included a pUC-derived replication origin, the high level expression in Escherichia coli cells hindered the cloning of certain genes. In the present study, new plasmids were constructed, two resident plasmids, four integration plasmids, and four cloning plasmids, all of which possess the medium-copy number replication origin, p15A ori, isolated from pACYC177. The resident plasmids consisted of the following three components: the p15A ori (0.65-kb Bg/II fragment), the pVA380-1 basic replicon functional in mutans streptococci (2.5-kb BamHI fragment), and either an erythromycin resistance or a spectinomycin resistance gene (0.9- or 1.1-kb BamHI fragment, respectively). Most of the basic replicon of pVA380-1, except for the 3'-portion of the 0.2-kb region, in the resident plasmid was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene to construct the four integration plasmids. Therefore, the upstream and downstream anchor sites for the double cross-over event in this new system were 0.65-kb p15A ori and the 0.2-kb portion of the 3'-end of pVA380-1 replicon, respectively. This system was used to clone the gene coding for cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase which produces cycloisomaltooligosaccharide, a potent inhibitor of oral streptococcal glucosyltransferase, isolated from Bacillus circulans chromosome, into Streptococcus gordonii, and its gene product was successfully secreted into the culture media. Plasmids described here should be useful tools for introducing heterologous DNA into resident plasmids following integration in oral streptococci.
TI  - The sgp gene modulates stress responses of Streptococcus mutans: utilization of an antisense RNA strategy to investigate essential gene functions.
AB  - The sgp gene from Streptococcus mutans has been previously isolated, characterized, and demonstrated to encode a G-protein. In order to investigate the function of this gene, a novel antisense RNA strategy was developed. Expression of sgp antisense RNA in Escherichia coli led to transient inhibition of growth. In addition, sgp antisense RNA expression in S. mutans resulted in decreased growth under environmental stress conditions (44 degrees C, acidic pH, and high osmolarity). Therefore, these results suggest that the sgp gene plays a role in modulating the stress responses of S. mutans. This approach could be applicable for investigating the function of essential genes in other organisms for which mutants are not available.
TI  - Anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  - Reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. As expected, the cations Fe2+ and Cu+ enhanced killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 by hydroperoxides. However, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to O2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. Sensitivities to anaerobic killing by Fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. The oral streptococci Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus rattus FA-1, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 were approximately as sensitive as S. mutans GS-5. Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, and Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45 had intermediate sensitivity, while Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 and Escherichia coli B were insensitive. Killing of S. mutans GS-5 in response to millimolar levels of added Fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and pH. The organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. Chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. Sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to Fe2+ exposure. Fe2+, but not Fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of S. mutans. The reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to Fe2+ inhibition of F-ATPase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or F1 enzyme separated from membranes. Cu+ and Cu2+ also inhibited F-ATPase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. All of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  - In the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, Candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. Three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. Among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different Gram-positive bacteria. It inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/mL which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. It functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. The antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.
TI  - The N-terminal half part of the oral streptococcal antigen I/IIf contains two distinct binding domains.
AB  - In order to investigate the binding properties of the antigen I/IIf from Streptococcus mutans, we analyzed the binding activity of five I/IIf derivatives expressed by I/IIf gene derivatives obtained by insertion of a kanamycin resistance marker. ELISA-derived binding assays showed that the derivatives containing both the N-terminal alanine-rich domain (A-region) and an A-region distal domain extending to amino-acid 766 were the most effective in binding biotinylated (Biot-) human salivary components (SAC) and Biot-epithelial cell membrane components. Sodium metaperiodate treatment of SAC inhibited these interactions, suggesting a binding specificity of the A-region distal domain for carbohydrate residues. All the I/IIf derivatives were found to bind Biot-type I collagen, Biot-laminin, Biot-keratin, and Biot-fibronectin, the derivatives containing the A-region but lacking the A-region distal domain exhibiting the highest binding levels. Sodium metaperiodate treatment of laminin had no effect on its binding to the derivatives, suggesting that carbohydrate residues of the ligand were not involved.
TI  - Thermophysiology of Streptococcus mutans and related lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  - The temperature ranges for growth of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and S. sobrinus 6715 were found to be very narrow, from about 30 to 47 degrees C, with optimal growth around 37 degrees C. Thus, the organisms showed little potential to grow in the environment outside of the animal host. In contrast wider ranges were found for Enterococcus hirae, S. rattus and S. sanguis. Detailed study of S. mutans GS-5 showed that energetic coupling, reflected in yields of biomass per mol of glucose utilized, were not greatly affected by changes in temperature within the growth range. However, since glycolysis occurred over a wider temperature range (about 10 to 52 degrees C) than growth, yield values dropped to zero at temperatures above or below the growth range. The temperature range for glycolysis could be related to temperature sensitivity of the phosphoenolypyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system for sugar uptake. F-ATPases were active over a similar range of temperatures, but with a broad optimal range from about 30 to 50 degrees C. Proton permeability of S. mutans increased steadily with temperature in a manner similar to that of other mesophilic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. Growth of the bacteria in media supplemented with various fatty acids had major effects on proton permeabilities but the effects were not well reflected by changes in growth or glycolysis of the bacteria. The overall conclusions were that S. mutans is a typical mesophile in relation to membrane and catabolic functions but its narrow temperature range for growth is related to temperature sensitivities of anabolic systems.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the Streptococcus mutans hrcA, grpE and dnaK genes and regulation of expression in response to heat shock and environmental acidification.
AB  - The dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans persists and causes diseases in highly dynamic environments and gains a selective ecological advantage in environmental conditions that frequently exceed the limits for growth of the organism, particularly with regard to environmental pH. The goal of this study was to begin a molecular genetic analysis of a major stress protein, DnaK/Hsp70, to begin to understand how stress responses are regulated in this lactic acid bacterium and to establish a relationship between dnaK gene expression and exposure to acidic environments. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the dnaK gene is preceded by, and is in an operon-like arrangement with, the hrcA and grpE genes, although intergenic spacing was unlike that described in other bacteria. An inverted repeat (a CIRCE element) was identified by sequence analysis and, using primer extensions, a heat shock-responsive, sigmaA-type promoter, P1, 5' to the hrcA gene, and a sigmaB-type promoter, 5' to the grpE translational start site, were identified. No promoters were detected between grpE and dnaK. A strain carrying a strongly polar insertion in the hrcA gene had markedly diminished levels of dnaK mRNA, indicating that dnaK was transcribed as part of an operon from P1, and to a lesser extent from P2. Results from physiological manipulation of S. mutans in continuous chemostat culture demonstrated that steadystate levels of S. mutans dnaK mRNA and DnaK protein were (i) increased in response to acid shock; (ii) elevated in acid 'adapted' cells; and (iii) induced in response to alkali shock of acid 'adapted' cells. In all cases, increased amounts of dnaK mRNA could be correlated with enhanced transcription from P1. This study provides the first detailed analysis of the expression of a heat shock gene from an oral isolate, and the evidence provided suggests that sigmaB-like promoters may also be involved in class I heat shock gene expression in some Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Identification of a fourth gene involved in dTDP-rhamnose synthesis in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We had isolated three genes (rmlA, rmlB, and rmlC) involved in dTDP-rhamnose synthesis in Streptococcus mutans and found that three genes were insufficient for dTDP-rhamnose synthesis (Y. Tsukioka, Y. Yamashita, T. Oho, Y. Nakano, and T. Koga, J. Bacteriol. 179:1126-1134, 1997). The rmlD gene of S. mutans, encoding the enzyme which catalyzes the last step of dTDP-rhamnose synthesis, has been cloned and sequenced. The cell extract of Escherichia coli expressing the rmlD gene of S. mutans exhibited enzymatic activity corresponding to its counterpart in Shigella flexneri, a gram-negative bacterium. Rhamnose was not detected in the cell wall preparation purified from the mutant in which the cloned gene was insertionally inactivated. Rabbit antiserum against S. mutans serotype c-specific antigen did not react with autoclaved extracts from the mutant. The rmlD gene product of S. mutans compensated for the incompleteness of dTDP-rhamnose synthesis by the three previously isolated genes. These results indicate that the rmlD gene product is indispensable for the dTDP-rhamnose pathway and subsequently for the synthesis of serotype-specific antigen in S. mutans. Furthermore, conservation of the rmlD gene in Streptococcus species was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis.
TI  - Identification of essential amino acids in the Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases.
AB  - A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the glucosyltransferases (GTFs) of mutans streptococci with those from the alpha-amylase family of enzymes revealed a number of conserved amino acid positions which have been implicated as essential in catalysis. Utilizing a site-directed mutagenesis approach with the GTF-I enzyme of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, we identified three of these conserved amino acid positions, Asp413, Trp491, and His561, as being important in enzymatic activity. Mutagenesis of Asp413 to Thr resulted in a GTF which expressed only about 12% of the wild-type activity. In contrast, mutagenesis of Asp411 did not inhibit enzyme activity. In addition, the D413T mutant was less stable than was the parental enzyme when expressed in Escherichia coli. Moreover, conversion of Trp491 or His561 to either Gly or Ala resulted in enzymes devoid of GTF activity, indicating the essential nature of these two amino acids for activity. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the four Tyr residues present at positions 169 to 172 which are part of a subdomain with homology to the direct repeating sequences present in the glucan-binding domain of the GTFs had little overall effect on enzymatic activity, although the glucan products appeared to be less adhesive. These results are discussed relative to the mechanisms of catalysis proposed for the GTFs and related enzymes.
TI  - Effects of antibodies against cell surface protein antigen PAc-glucosyltransferase fusion proteins on glucan synthesis and cell adhesion of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Cell surface protein antigen (PAc) and glucosyltransferases (GTFs) produced by Streptococcus mutans are considered to be major colonization factors of the organism, and the inhibition of these two factors is predicted to provide protection against dental caries. In this study, we have constructed fusion protein PAcA-GB, a fusion of the saliva-binding alanine-rich region (PAcA) of PAc with the glucan binding (GB) domain of GTF-I, an enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of water-insoluble glucan from sucrose, and fusion protein PAcA-SB, a fusion of PAcA with the sucrose binding (SB) domain of GTF-I. The recombinant fusion proteins were purified from cell extracts of Escherichia coli harboring the fusion genes, and rabbit antibodies against these fusion proteins were prepared. Water-insoluble glucan synthesis by cell-associated and cell-free GTF preparations from S. mutans as well as total glucan synthesis by GTF-I was markedly inhibited by anti-PAcA-GB immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies but not by anti-PAcA-SB IgG antibodies. Significant inhibition of the sucrose-independent and sucrose-dependent adhesion of S. mutans to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was observed when anti-PAcA-GB antibodies were added to the reaction mixture. Anti-PAcA-SB antibodies inhibited the adhesion of S. mutans to the beads in the absence of sucrose but not in the presence of sucrose. Immunization with the fusion protein PAcA-GB may be useful for controlling the colonization of teeth by S. mutans.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and expression of the L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - The ldh gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+) lactate dehydrogenase from the ruminal bacterium Streptococcus bovis was cloned and sequenced. A genomic library of S. bovis JB1 DNA was constructed in lambda ZAP II and screened by use of a heterologous probe derived from the cloned Streptococcus mutans ldh gene. Several clones were isolated that contained a common 2.9-kb fragment as determined by restriction analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 987-bp open reading frame with extensive homology to Streptococcus thermophilus and S. mutans ldh nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Expression of the cloned S. bovis ldh gene in Escherichia coli was confirmed by the ability to complement the ldh mutation of E. coli FMJ39, by using an in-gel activity screen and by enzymatic assay. Increased LDH activity was observed in S. bovis JB1 containing the cloned ldh genes on a multicopy plasmid.
TI  - Galactose oxidase-glucan binding domain fusion proteins as targeting inhibitors of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - In order to inhibit the growth of bacteria present in the human oral cavity, a novel system which targets antimicrobial agents to dental plaque has been developed. This system involves a hybrid protein consisting of a peptide expressing the bactericidal properties of galactose oxidase (GAO) fused to the glucan binding domain (GBD) of the Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase-S enzyme. A gene encoding GAO from the fungus Fusarium sp. has been inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector and fused to sequences encoding the GBD, which binds to the glucans synthesized by oral streptococci. Bacterial extracts expressing the hybrid protein were tested for their ability to target the GAO activity to an in vitro plaque model consisting of streptococcal cells bound to microtiter plate wells. The binding of the hybrid protein to the streptococcal cells through its GBD and the dependence of binding on the production of glucans by bacteria were demonstrated. Furthermore, killing of three different species of oral streptococci by bound hybrid protein in conjunction with the galactose-lactoperoxidase-iodide cytotoxic system has been demonstrated. These results suggest a novel strategy for controlling dental plaque formation as well as dental caries in humans.
TI  - Synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  - Glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. The one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. The results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13C-NMR studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. These oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by Streptococcus mutans, and they effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. In an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by Bifidobacteria.
TI  - The lac operon of Lactobacillus casei contains lacT, a gene coding for a protein  of the Bg1G family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  - The 5' region of the lac operon of Lactobacillus casei has been investigated. An  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lacT, was identified upstream of lacE. The gene product encoded by lacT is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes BglG from Escherichia coli, ArbG from Erwinia chrysanthemi, SacT, SacY, and LicT from Bacillus subtilis, and BglR from Lactococcus lactis. Amino acid sequence identities range from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. The transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lacT. The corresponding mRNA would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus RNA binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. LacT was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a B. subtilis test system using the sacB target sequence. lacT directly precedes lacEGF, the genes coding for enzyme IICB, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme IIA, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. Northern hybridizations with probes against lacT, lacE, and lacF revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mRNAs of several L. casei strains. Since the length of the lac mRNA is just sufficient to contain lacTEGF, we conclude that the lac operon of L. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Age-related changes in salivary antibodies to commensal oral and gut biota.
AB  - The prevalence of mucosally derived infections appears to increase with age, suggesting dysfunction at the mucosal surfaces. The present investigation was undertaken to examine any age-related changes in secretion rates and concentrations of secretory antibodies in whole and parotid saliva in a healthy adult population. A total of 116 subjects were subdivided into the following age groups: 20-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-79 years and 80 years and over. Specific immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG and IgM antibodies in whole and parotid saliva to Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Actinomyces viscosus NCTC 10951, and Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgA antibodies to all three organisms examined increased with age in both whole and parotid saliva, whereas IgG antibody levels to S. mutans in whole saliva were significantly decreased with age. IgG antibodies to E. coli in parotid saliva were reduced in older age groups. IgM antibody levels to S. mutans were reduced with age in both secretions, whereas IgM antibodies to A. viscosus were greatest in the oldest age groups. No significant changes with age were observed in salivary IgM antibody levels to E. coli. No significant reduction in the secretion rates of IgA antibodies were observed in parotid or whole saliva, whereas IgG and IgM antibody secretion rates to all three microorganisms were reduced in most age groups in both whole and parotid saliva. The results of this investigation have demonstrated age-related changes with salivary antibodies, but, whereas salivary IgG and IgM antibodies showed decreases, salivary IgA levels generally increased with age. This suggests that the ability to form IgA antibody responses is not impaired with increased age, and that secretion rates and functional properties of antibodies may be as important as concentrations in protection against mucosal infective diseases.
TI  - Biological function of the dTDP-rhamnose synthesis pathway in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We have cloned a new gene locus that comprises three genes concerned with the biosynthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen in Streptococcus mutans. The genes encode proteins exhibiting significant homology to the rfbA, rfbB, and rfbD gene products that are involved in the anabolism of dTDP-L-rhamnose from D-glucose-1-phosphate. This anabolism pathway pertains to biosynthesis of the O antigen of lipopolysaccharide in gram-negative bacteria. The cell extract of Escherichia coli expressing each of the cloned genes of S. mutans exhibited enzymatic activity corresponding to the homologous counterpart of the rfb gene products. Rhamnose was not detected in the cell wall preparation purified from the mutant in which each of the three cloned genes was insertionally inactivated. Rabbit antiserum against S. mutans serotype c-specific antigen did not react with the autoclaved extracts from these mutants. These results indicate that the gene products identified in the present study are involved in the dTDP-L-rhamnose synthesis pathway and that the pathway relates to the biosynthesis of the serotype-specific polysaccharide antigen of S. mutans. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that genes homologous to the cloned genes involved in the dTDP-L-rhamnose synthesis pathway were widely distributed in a variety of streptococci. This is the first report of the biological function of the dTDP-rhamnose pathway in streptococci.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the gbpC gene encoding a novel glucan-binding protein of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We have isolated dextran-aggregation-negative mutants of Streptococcus mutans following random mutagenesis with plasmid pVA891 clone banks. A chromosomal region responsible for this phenotype was characterized in one of the mutants. A 2.2-kb fragment from the region was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. A gene specifying a putative protein of 583 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 63,478 was identified. The amino acid sequence deduced from the gene exhibited no similarity to the previously identified S. mutans 74-kDa glucan-binding protein or to glucan-binding domains of glucosyltransferases but exhibited similarity to surface protein antigen (Spa)-family proteins from streptococci. Extract from an E. coli clone of the gene exhibited glucan-binding activity. Therefore, the gene encoded a novel glucan-binding protein.
TI  - Role of the citrate pathway in glutamate biosynthesis by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - In work previously reported (J. A. Gutierrez, P. J. Crowley, D. P. Brown, J. D. Hillman, P. Youngman, and A. S. Bleiweis, J. Bacteriol. 178:4166-4175, 1996), a Tn917 transposon-generated mutant of Streptococcus mutans JH1005 unable to synthesize glutamate anaerobically was isolated and the insertion point of the transposon was determined to be in the icd gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH). The intact icd gene of S. mutans has now been isolated from an S. mutans genomic plasmid library by complementation of an icd mutation in Escherichia coli host strain EB106. Genetic analysis of the complementing plasmid pJG400 revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,182 nucleotides which encoded an enzyme of 393 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 43 kDa. The nucleotide sequence contained regions of high (60 to 72%) homology with icd genes from three other bacterial species. Immediately 5' of the icd gene, we discovered an ORF of 1,119 nucleotides in length, designated citZ, encoding a homolog of known citrate synthase genes from other bacteria. This ORF encoded a predicted protein of 372 amino acids with a molecular mass of 43 kDa. Furthermore, plasmid pJG400 was also able to complement a citrate synthase (gltA) mutation of E. coli W620. The enzyme activities of both ICDH, found to be NAD+ dependent, and citrate synthase were measured in cell extracts of wild-type S. mutans and E. coli mutants harboring plasmid pJG400. The region 5' from the citZ gene also revealed a partial ORF encoding 264 carboxy-terminal amino acids of a putative aconitase gene. The genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that S. mutans possesses the enzymes required to convert acetyl coenzyme A and oxalacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate, which is necessary for the synthesis of glutamic acid. Indeed, S. mutans JH1005 was shown to assimilate ammonia as a sole source of nitrogen in minimal medium devoid of organic nitrogen sources.

TI  - Studies on the antimicrobial activity of juglans regia.
AB  - Juglans regia L. bark is used in some countries as a toothbrush and as a dye for  coloring the lips for cosmetic purposes. Its extract showed a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in a dose dependent manner. It inhibited the growth of several species of pathogenic micro-organisms representing Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans), Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a pathogenic yeast (Candida albicans). The extract has either synergistic or additive action when tested with a wide range of antibacterial drugs. It also increased the pH of saliva. Thus, brushing the teeth with this bark may improve oral hygiene, prevent plaque and caries formation, and reduce the incidence of gingival and periodontal infections.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the Streptococcus mutans membrane-bound, proton-translocating ATPase operon.
AB  - The function of the membrane-bound ATPase in S. mutans is to regulate cytoplasmic pH values for the purpose of maintaining delta pH. Previous studies have shown that as part of its acid-adaptive ability, S. mutans is able to increase H(+)-ATPase levels in response to acidification. As part of the study of ATPase regulation in S. mutans, we have cloned the ATPase operon and determined its genetic organization. The structural genes from S. mutans were found to be in the order: c, a, b, delta, alpha, gamma, beta, and epsilon; where c and a were reversed from the more typical bacterial organization. The operon contained no I gene homologue but was preceded by a 239-bp intergenic space. Deduced aa sequences from open reading frames indicated that genes encoding homologues of glycogen phosphorylase and nonphosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase flank the H(+)-ATPase operon, 5' and 3' respectively. Sequence analysis indicated the presence of three inverted-repeat nt sequences in the glgP-uncE intergenic space. Primer extension analysis of mRNAs prepared from batch-grown or steady-state cultures demonstrated that the transcriptional start site did not change as a function of culture pH value. The data suggest that potential stem-and-loop structures in the promoter region of the operon do not function to alter the starting position of ATPase-specific mRNA transcription.
TI  - Isolation and preliminary characterization of the Streptococcus mutans rpsJ gene.
AB  - We previously reported that four putative open reading frames were identified in  the regions flanking the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 fructosyltransferase gene. For one of these, ORF 4, only a small region had been isolated and the first 30 nucleotides had been sequenced. In order to determine whether this open reading frame is part of an expressed gene, we isolated a DNA fragment containing intact ORF 4 and a portion of the downstream ORF 5 by inverse polymerase chain reaction. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of ORF 4 and ORF 5 with other proteins revealed that the ORF 4 and ORF 5 gene products were highly homologous to ribosomal proteins S10 and L3, respectively, of several bacteria. To identify the precise transcriptional start site for the ORF 4 gene, primer extension analysis was carried out. The results indicated initiation at a G residue with corresponding -10 and -35 regions homologous to the Escherichia coli consensus promoter sequences. These results indicate that the sequences of ORF 4 and ORF 5 are consistent with the structures of ribosomal proteins S10 and L3, respectively, and are present in a ribosomal protein operon.
TI  - Organization and nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans galactose operon.
AB  - The galactose operon encoding a repressor and genes for the Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism (galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate-uridyl transferase and UDP glucose-4-epimerase) was located adjacent to the multiple sugar metabolism (msm) operon on the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt (serotype c) and the complete nucleotide sequence of this 5-kilobase region was determined. The Leloir pathway was induced by the presence of galactose in the growth medium or following the release of intracellular galactose after uptake and cleavage of alpha-galactosides by the multiple sugar metabolism system. Analysis of the mechanism of galactose transport confirmed the absence of a galactose-specific phosphotransferase system and suggested the presence of an inducible galactose permease. Evidence is presented that galactose transport is independent of the proton motive force and may be ATP-dependent.
TI  - Characterization of a P1-deficient strain of Streptococcus mutans that expresses  the SpaA protein of Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - The Streptococcus sobrinus SpaA protein and the Streptococcus mutans P1 protein share 66% sequence homology at the amino acid level. To determine if the SpaA protein can be expressed in S. mutans and functionally replace the P1 protein, the spaA gene of S. sobrinus 6715 was isolated from plasmid pX1303 and inserted into the Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector pVA838. The resulting plasmid pX1600 was transformed into the P1-deficient strain S. mutans 834 that has defects in saliva-mediated aggregation and in the ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surfaces. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cellular protein fractions of S. mutans 834 (pX1600) detected in mutanolysin-solubilized cell walls a major protein of 210 kDa with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of S. sobrinus SpaA protein and a minor 210-kDa protein and a major 64-kDa protein in the extracellular protein fraction. Analysis of virulence traits showed that expression of SpaA protein by S. mutans 834(pX1600) cells had restored the ability of the S. mutans 834 cells to aggregate in the presence of saliva or salivary agglutinin but not to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. This cell aggregation was inhibited specifically by antisera to S. sobrinus SpaA protein. These results indicate that SpaA plays a role in the virulence of S. sobrinus by specifically interacting with fluid-phase salivary agglutinin to mediate cell aggregation.
TI  - Serum antibodies to commensal oral and gut bacteria vary with age.
AB  - This study examined the relationship between serum antibody levels to selected bacteria from the commensal oral and gut flora with increased age in a healthy adult population. A total of 116 healthy subjects were studied consisting of the following age groups: 20-39 years (group A), 40-59 years (group B), 60-79 years (group C) and 80+ years (group D). Only significantly lower mean IgM antibody levels to Streptococcus mutans strain Guy's serotype c were observed in older age groups (P < 0.001). With Actinomyces viscosus NCTC 10951 significantly reduced IgM levels (P < 0.02) and significantly elevated IgA levels were observed with increased age (P < 0.05). IgA and IgG antibodies to Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 were increased significantly in the older age groups (P < 0.001), whilst a trend toward lower levels of IgM antibodies was recorded with age. No changes in IgA antibodies to Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 were observed but the lowest level of IgM antibodies were detected in the oldest age group (P < 0.05). Mean specific activity was decreased with age with IgM antibodies to the oral bacteria and increased with age with IgG and IgA antibodies to E. coli. Overall, our results suggest a general reduction in serum IgM antibody responses. This impairment in the circulatory IgM immune response may contribute to the increased occurrence of infections in the elderly.
TI  - Characterization of IS199 from Streptococcus mutans V403.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the insertion sequence IS199 has been determined. This novel element was found in Streptococcus mutans V403 where DNA hybridization studies suggested that it was present in multiple copies on the genome. IS199 is 1220 bp and appears unique to the mutans streptococci. A limited epidemiological survey revealed this element to occur infrequently in this group (4/50 strains examined). IS199 belongs to the IS3 family of procaryotic insertion sequence elements. It contained tandem open reading frames (ORFs) reminiscent of the structure of the IS3 class. Additionally, the larger of the two ORF products (ORFB) exhibited amino acid sequence similarities to comparable proteins from IS3 and other elements of this family. Transposition of IS199 gave rise to a 3-bp target site duplication. We were able to insert an antibiotic resistance gene into IS199 enabling us to follow the transposition of this element in S. mutans V403.
TI  - Insertional mutagenesis and recovery of interrupted genes of Streptococcus mutans by using transposon Tn917: preliminary characterization of mutants displaying acid sensitivity and nutritional requirements.
AB  - New vectors were constructed for efficient transposon Tn917-mediated mutagenesis  of poorly transformable strains of Streptococcus mutans(pTV1-OK) and subsequent recovery of interrupted genes in Escherichia coli (pT21delta2TetM). In this report, we demonstrate the utility of Tn917 mutagenesis of a poorly transformable strain of S. mutans (JH1005) by showing (i) the conditional replication of pTV1-OK, a repA(Ts) derivative of the broad-host-range plasmid pWVO1 harboring Tn9l7, in JH1005 at the permissive temperature (30 degrees C) versus that at the nonpermissive temperature (45 degrees C); (ii) transposition frequencies similar to those reported for Bacillus subtilis (10(-5) to 10(-4)) with efficient plasmid curing in 90 to 97% of the erythromycin-resistant survivors following a temperature shift to 42 to 45 degrees C; and (iii) the apparent randomness of Tn917 insertion as determined by Southern hybridization analysis and the ability to isolate nutritional mutants, mutants in acid tolerance, and mutants in bacteriocin production, at frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 0.7%. Recovery of transposon-interrupted genes was achieved by two methods: (i) marker rescue in E. coli with the recovery vector pTV21delta2TetM, a tetracycline-resistant and ampicillin-sensitive Tn9l7-pBR322 hybrid, and (ii) "shotgun" cloning of genomic libraries of Tn917 mutants into pUC19. Sequence analyses revealed insertions at five different genetic loci in sequences displaying homologies to Clostridium spp.fhs (66% identity), E. coli dfp (43% identity), and B. subtilis ylxM-ffh (58% identity), icd (citC [69% identity]), and argD (61% identity). Insertions in icd and argD caused nutritional requirements; the one in ylxM-ffh caused acid sensitivity, while those in fhs and dfp caused both acid sensitivity and nutritional requirements. This paper describes the construction of pTV1-OK and demonstrates that it can be efficiently employed to deliver Tn917 into S. mutans for genetic analyses with some degree of randomness and that insertions in the chromosome can be easily recovered for subsequent characterization. This represents the first published report of successful Tn9l7 mutagenesis in the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Identification of the Streptococcus mutans frp gene as a potential regulator of fructosyltransferase expression.
AB  - Four putative open reading frames (ORFs) were previously identified in the regions flanking the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 fructosyltransferase (FTF) gene. One of these, ORF 3, appeared to code for a low-molecular-mass protein containing amino acid sequences sharing homology with several Gram-positive bacterial DNA-binding proteins and it was suggested that the ORF 3 gene product might be an FTF regulatory protein (FRP). In order to characterize this protein, we have purified the biotinylated tag-FRP fusion protein using the PinPoint protein purification system and this fusion protein was used in gel shift assays with DNA fragments containing the ftf promoter region. FRP bound specifically to the upstream region of the ftf promoter containing the inverted repeat structure that is present upstream of the -35 sequence. In contrast, FRP did not bind to DNA fragments lacking the inverted repeat structure. The results of these experiments suggest that FRP interacts with the inverted repeat region upstream of the ftf promoter and such interactions may regulate FTF expression.
TI  - Deletion and reintroduction of glucosyltransferase genes of Streptococcus mutans  and role of their gene products in sucrose dependent cellular adherence.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans has three kinds of glucosyltransferases (GTases), i.e. GTase-I, GTase-SI and GTase-S. These enzymes co-operatively synthesize adhesive glucan from sucrose, which contributes to firm adherence of growing organisms to solid surfaces. In this study, the genes encoding GTase-I (gtfB) and GTase-SI (gtfC) of S. mutans MT8148 (serotype c) were inactivated by the insertion mutagenesis by allelic exchange. Three types of isogenic mutants lacking either GTase-I, GTase-SI or both, respectively were isolated. Sucrose dependent cellular adherence of these mutants were significantly lower than that of the parent. Adherence of GTase-SI deficient mutant was lower than that of GTase-I deficient mutant. We then generated Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle vectors carrying the gtfB and gtfC gene. The shuttle vector containing the gtfB gene was transformed into the GTase-I deficient mutant. Western blot analysis of the transformant revealed that GTase-I protein was fully expressed. Sucrose dependent adherence of the transformant increased but did not reach that of the parent. Similarly, the shuttle vector containing the gtfC gene was transformed into the GTase-SI deficient mutant. The expression of GTase-SI and sucrose dependent adherence of the transformant was revealed to be at a level similar to those by the parent. These results indicated that GTase-SI does play an essential role in the production of adhesive glucan that can lead to firm cellular adherence to solid surfaces.

TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of sucrose phosphorylase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides No. 165.
AB  - The sucrose phosphorylase gene of an isolate, Leuconostoc mesenteroides No. 165,  was amplified by PCR, cloned on pUC118, and expressed in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of the gene showed 96.3% similarity to that of L. mesenteroides ATCC12291 and 67% to that of Streptococcus mutans, but low similarity to the Agrobacterium vitis gene. The cloned gene, which fusing with lacZalpha, was expressed inducibly with IPTG in E. coli to produce an active enzyme in large quantities that accounted for about 50% of the total cell protein.
TI  - Oral colonization by more than one clonal type of mutans streptococcus in children with nursing-bottle dental caries.
AB  - By ribotyping the genetic diversity of mutans streptococci in six 1.5-3-yr-old children with nursing-bottle caries and in six caries-free, age-matched children and in their mothers was examined. The proportion of mutans streptococci in the dental plaque of the children and their levels in the saliva of the mothers were also examined. For ribotyping, chromosomal DNA of isolates obtained from the plaque of the children (3-12 isolates per child) and from the saliva of the mothers (4-13 isolates per mother) was digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII. The DNA fragments were hybridized to the plasmid pKK3535 which contains the rRNA operon of the Escherichia coli chromosome. The results showed that children with nursing-bottle caries exposed to frequent consumption of sucrose had a high proportion of mutans streptococci in plaque and four of them were colonized with more than one ribotype, whereas caries-free children had a low proportion of mutans streptococci in plaque and only one of them harboured more than one ribotype. Mothers of children with nursing bottle caries had similar levels and numbers of ribotypes of mutans streptococci in saliva as the mothers of the caries-free children. In both child groups, mothers were probably the main source of infection with mutans streptococci. Thus, children with nursing-bottle caries were not only heavily infected with mutans streptococci but also often colonized with more than one clonal type. In the child's acquisition of such clones, frequent sugar consumption may have an important role.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the pfl gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We have isolated a sorbitol-negative mutant of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 following random mutagenesis with plasmid pVA891 clone banks. This mutant did not metabolize sorbitol anaerobically but did so aerobically. A 10-kb chromosomal DNA fragment flanking the pVA891 insertion was deleted in this mutant. The corresponding region from the parental strain GS-5 was then recovered by a marker rescue method with Escherichia coli. The pyruvate formate-lyase gene, pfl, was identified within a 3-kb PstI-XbaI fragment located in the middle of the deleted region of the chromosome, and its inactivation in S. mutans produced the same sorbitol-negative phenotype. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the pfl gene revealed a 2.3-kb open reading frame (ORF) preceded by potential ribosome-binding and promoter-like sequences. The ORF specified a putative protein of 775 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 87,533. The amino acid sequence deduced from the ORF exhibited significant similarity to that of the E. coli pfl gene.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - To discover the molecular properties of two distinct NADH oxidases, corresponding to H2O2-forming oxidase (NOX-1) and H2O-forming oxidase (NOX-2) induced in Streptococcus mutans, for the first step we had cloned and sequenced the nox-1 gene encoding NOX-1. In this paper, a nox-2 gene encoding NOX-2 from S. mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The nox-2 gene comprises 1371 base-pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. The deduced relative molecular mass (M(r) = 49919) agreed with the previous value obtained from the purified NOX-2 protein. The nox-2 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the NOX-2 protein sequence with that of the NOX-1 showed that the proteins do not significantly resemble each other. Comparisons with the NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 yield identities of 41%. The redox-active cysteine in the enzyme from S. faecalis was found to correspond to Cys 44 in the NOX-2.
TI  - Immunologic characteristics of a Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase B sucrose-binding site peptide-cholera toxin B-subunit chimeric protein.
AB  - Glucosyltranferases (Gtfs) produced by the mutans streptococci are recognized as  virulence factors in dental caries, and the inhibition of Gtfs by secretory immunoglobulin A is predicted to provide protection against this disease. The basis of such mucosal immunity is linked to the ability to reliably stimulate production of secretory immunoglobulin A against Gtfs. In this regard, we are exploring the immunogenicities of various Gtf peptides genetically fused to the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), a known mucosal adjuvant. In this work, we have created a gene fusion linking the GtfB active-site (AS) peptide DANFDSIRVDAVDNVDADLLQIA to the amino terminus of CTB. This sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of gtfB from Streptococcus mutans GS5, has been found to be strongly conserved in Gtfs from several mutans streptococci. We have purified this recombinant protein (AS:CTB) from Escherichia coli carrying the fusion gene under the control of the lactose operon promoter. This protein was immunogenic in rabbits and produced specific serum antibodies against both the Gtf peptide and the CTB moiety. The antiserum was tested for its ability to inhibit GtfB activity obtained from a mutant of S. mutans able to make only this enzyme and none of the other usual Gtfs or fructosyltransferase. Approximately 50% of the GtfB activity was inhibited in such assays. These results suggest that the AS of this enzyme is accessible to antibody binding and that this region of the protein may be considered a vulnerable target for vaccine design and development. The AS:CTB was able to bind GM1, ganglioside in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, indicating that the recombinant protein retained this property, which is though to be critical to the mucosal immunoadjuvant properties of CTB. Thus, this protein may be promising as a candidate anticaries vaccinogen alone or in combination with other Gtf peptides or conjugates.
TI  - A system to generate chromosomal mutations in Lactococcus lactis which allows fast analysis of targeted genes.
AB  - A system for generating chromosomal insertions in lactococci is described. It is  based on the conditional replication of lactococcal pWV01-derived Ori+ RepA- vector pORI19, containing lacZ alpha and the multiple cloning site of pUC19. Chromosomal AluI fragments of Lactococcus lactis were cloned in pORI19 in RepA+ helper strain Escherichia coli EC101. The frequency of Campbell-type recombinants, following introduction of this plasmid bank into L. lactis (RepA-), was increased by combining the system with temperature-sensitive pWV01 derivative pVE6007. Transformation of L. lactis MG1363 (pVE6007) with the pORI19 bank of lactococcal chromosomal fragments at the permissive temperature allowed replication of several copies of a recombinant plasmid from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of RepA-Ts from pVE6007. A temperature shift to 37 degrees C resulted in loss of pVE6007 and integration of the pORI19 derivatives at high frequencies. A bank of lactococcal mutants was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two mutations: one in the monocistronic 1.3-kb peptidoglycan hydrolase gene (acmA) and one in the hitherto uncharacterized maltose fermentation pathway. Reintroduction of pVE6007 into the Mal- mutant at 30 degrees C resulted in excision of the integrated plasmid and restoration of the ability of ferment maltose. The integration plasmid (pMAL) was rescued by using the isolated plasmid content of a restored Mal+ colony to transform E. coli EC101. Nucleotide sequencing of the 564-bp chromosomal fragment in pMAL revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant homology with ATP-binding proteins MalK of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Enterobacter aerogenes and MsmK of Streptococcus mutans. This combined use of two types of conditional replicating pWV01-derived vectors represents a novel, powerful tool for chromosomal gene inactivation, targeting, cloning, and sequencing of the labelled gene.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (GtfC) expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans constitutively expresses three glucosyltransferases, i.e., GtfB, GtfC, and GtfD; which synthesize glucan polymers from sucrose. To obtain individual GTF without complexing with one another, a purification strategy was developed to recover recombinant GTF expressed from Escherichia coli. The recombinant GtfC was aggregated and associated with the insoluble fraction in E. coli homogenates. GtfC was solublized with the 8M urea, renatured to its biologically active form by serial dialysis against sodium phosphate buffer, and subsequently purified to homogeneity by DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The GtfC enzyme preparation was purified 16.3-fold and the molecular weight was estimated to be 140 kDa. GtfC synthesized water insoluble glucan in a primer independent manner and its enzymatic activities could be enhanced by dextran. Purified GtfC had a pH optimum of 6.5, a K(m) of 9.26 mM for sucrose and a pI of 5.5. Distinct from the previous reports, results from this study offers an alternative for the purification of the recombinant GTFs free from any detergent contamination to make it more suitable for utilization in vivo.
TI  - Insertional inactivation of the Streptococcus mutans dexA (dextranase) gene results in altered adherence and dextran catabolism.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is able to synthesize extracellular glucans from sucrose which contribute to adherence of these bacteria. Extracellular dextranase can partially degrade the glucans, and may therefore affect virulence of S. mutans. In order to isolate mutants unable to produce dextranase, a DNA library was constructed by inserting random Sau3AI-digested fragments of chromosomal DNA from S. mutans into the BamHI site of the streptococcal integration vector pVA891, which is able to replicate in Escherichia coli but does not possess a streptococcal origin of replication. The resultant plasmids were introduced into S. mutans LT11, allowing insertional inactivation through homologous recombination. Two transformants were identified which did not possess dextranase activity. Integration of a single copy of the plasmid into the chromosome of these transformants was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis. Chromosomal DNA fragments flanking the plasmid were recovered using a marker rescue technique, and sequenced. Comparison with known sequences using the BLASTX program showed 56% homology at the amino acid level between the sequenced gene fragment and dextranase from Streptococcus sobrinus, strongly suggesting that the S. mutans dextranase gene (dexA) had been inactivated. The colony morphology of the dextranase mutants when grown on Todd-Hewitt agar containing sucrose was altered compared to the parent strain, with an apparent build-up of extracellular polymer. The mutants were also more adherent to a smooth surface than LT11 but there was no apparent difference in sucrose-dependent cell-cell aggregation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - DnaK expression in response to heat shock of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The oral pathogen, Streptococcus mutans, persistently colonizes human hosts and initiates oral disease despite extreme variations in environmental conditions. To begin to investigate the role of the stress protein, DnaK (Hsp70), in environmental stress responses by S. mutans, pulse-chase experiments were initially used to establish that a functional heat shock response existed in this organism. A C-terminal fragment of the S. mutans dnaK gene was cloned and engineered to be expressed with a histidine tag. Using the recombinant DnaK protein that had been purified by nickel affinity chromatography, an antibody specific for the S. mutans DnaK protein was generated to analyse DnaK expression under homeostatic and heat shock conditions. Western blot analysis indicated that the anti-recombinant DnaK antibody specifically recognized a protein (molecular mass approx. 68 kDa) which was induced in response to thermal stress. Elucidating the role of DnaK in responses by S. mutans to various environmental stressors will provide a better understanding of how DnaK is involved in survival of extreme environments and the contribution of the DnaK protein to the virulence of S. mutans.
TI  - Development of a heterodimer plasmid system for the introduction of heterologous  genes into streptococci.
AB  - We have previously constructed a model secretion system for oral streptococci using the secretory domain of the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 gtfB gene. As an initial step in developing systems for secreting protein fusions containing a glucan-binding polypeptide from streptococci, a DNA fragment corresponding to the glucan-binding domain (GBD) of the glucosyltransferase-S enzyme from strain GS-5 was fused to the gtfB secretory domain. However, it was not possible to clone the hybrid gene into Escherichia coli-streptococcal shuttle plasmids using E. coli as host cells. Integration of the hybrid GBD gene into the Streptococcus gordonii chromosome was directly accomplished utilizing a strategy involving a novel heterodimeric plasmid system. The heterodimer was constructed by ligating together two plasmids each containing DNA fragments homologous with a corresponding region of the S. gordonii chromosome flanking the hybrid GBD gene following a double crossover recombination event. However, this single-copy integrant secreted limited quantities of the GBD protein. In order to achieve high-level expression of the protein, the hybrid GBD gene was integrated into resident plasmids in S. gordonii following construction of intermediate heterodimeric plasmids. These plasmids contained the GBD gene flanked by sequences homologous to regions of the resident plasmids. The presence of the GBD protein in culture fluids from transformants harboring the multicopy plasmids demonstrated the secretion of the functional GBD protein. The strategy successfully developed for secreting the GBD in the streptococci should be adaptable for other organisms for which gene transfer systems are available. In addition, these systems will allow the direct introduction of genetic constructs when the constructs cannot be stably maintained in shuttle vectors within intermediate hosts such as E. coli.
TI  - Use of a novel mobilizable vector to inactivate the scrA gene of Streptococcus sobrinus by allelic replacement.
AB  - The virulence factors of the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus sobrinus have been difficult to assess because of a lack of tools for the genetic manipulation of this organism. The construction of an Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector, pDL289, that can be mobilized into S. sobrinus by the conjugative plasmid pAM beta 1 was described in a previous report. The vector contains pVA380-1 for replication and mobilization in streptococci, the pSC101 replicon for maintenance in E. coli, a kanamycin resistance marker that functions in both hosts, and the multiple cloning site and lacZ from pGEM7Zf(-). pDL289 is stable with or without selection in several species of Streptococcus. In this study, a derivative with a deletion in the minus origin of the pVA380-1 component of pDL289 was constructed. This derivative, pDL289 delta 202, was less stable than pDL289 in Streptococcus gordonii Challis, Streptococcus mutans, and S. sobrinus. Both pDL289 and pDL289 delta 202 were mobilizable by pAM beta 1 into S. sobrinus, with frequencies of 3 x 10(-6) and 1 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient CFU, respectively. The cloned scrA gene of S. sobrinus 6715-10 coding for the EIISuc of the sucrose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system was interrupted by the insertion of a streptococcal spectinomycin resistance gene active in E. coli and streptococci. The interrupted scrA gene was subcloned into both pDL289 and pDL289 delta 202. Each recombinant plasmid was introduced into the DL1 strain of S. gordonii Challis, which was then used as a recipient for the conjugative transfer of pAM beta 1. The latter plasmid was used to mobilize each recombinant plasmid from S. gordonii Challis DL1 to S. sobrinus 6715-10RF. Subsequently, recombinants derived from a double-crossover event were isolated on the basis of resistance to spectinomycin and susceptibility to kanamycin. Recombinational events were confirmed by Southern hybridization, and the inactivation of the EII Suc in double crossovers was confirmed by phosphotransferase system assays. This is the first report of allelic replacement in S. sobrinus.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of a novel G protein, SGP, from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The sgp gene of Streptococcus mutans was recently detected immediately downstream from the dgk gene within the same operon. In this study, the sgp gene was subcloned into the pMAL-c2 vector and SGP (S. mutans G protein) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein at a level of 40% of total cellular protein. One-step amylose affinity chromatography purification of this fusion protein yielded a product of approximately 95% purity. SGP was purified from this fusion protein following cleavage with protease factor Xa and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. In nucleotide binding assays, recombinant SGP showed specific binding for GTP and GDP, but not ATP, CTP, and UTP, and also catalyzed efficient hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Kinetic studies revealed that the SGP Km value for GTP in this reaction was approximately 5.9 microM. Mg2+ also served as a cofactor of SGP in this reaction. In vivo subcellular localization by immunogold labelling demonstrated that SGP was associated with both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. SGP not only had structural similarities with other G proteins but also proved to have high-level intrinsic GTPase activity. Therefore, SGP appears to be a new member of the G protein superfamily and may participate in transmembrane signaling in the responses of S. mutans cells to environmental stimuli.
TI  - Primer extension analysis of Streptococcus mutans promoter structures.
AB  - To characterize the promoter structures of Streptococcus mutans genes, primer extension analysis was carried out with 4 genes previously isolated in this laboratory. An analysis of the transcription start sites for the gtfB, gtfC, gtfD and ftf genes revealed that each transcript was initiated at a purine residue. Based on these sites, the -10 and -35 sequences for each transcript were deduced and compared. For all 4 transcripts, the -10, but not the -35, sequences were homologous to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus sequences.
TI  - Sequence, expression, and function of the gene for the nonphosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We report the sequencing of a 2,019-bp region of the Streptococcus mutans NG5 genome which contains a 1,428-bp open reading frame (ORF) whose putative translation product had 50% identity to the amino acid sequences of the nonphosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPN) from maize and pea. This ORF is located approximately 200 bp downstream of the ptsI gene coding for enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system. Mutant BCH150, in which the putative gapN gene had been inactivated, lacked GAPN activity that was present in the wild-type strain, thus positively identifying the ORF as the S. mutans gapN gene. Another strain of S. mutans, DC10, which contains an insertionally inactivated ptsI gene, still possessed GAPN activity, as did S. salivarius ATCC 25975, which contains an insertion element between the ptsI and gapN genes. Since the wild-type S. mutans NG5 lacks both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADH:NADP oxidoreductase activities, the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is important as a means of generating NADPH for biosynthetic reactions.
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Mucosal immunization with a bacterial protein antigen genetically coupled to cholera toxin A2/B subunits.
AB  - The generation of secretory IgA Abs for specific immune protection of mucosal surfaces depends on stimulation of the mucosal immune system, but this is not effectively achieved by parenteral or even oral administration of most soluble Ags. To harness the exceptional mucosal immunogenicity of cholera toxin (CT), which is largely attributed to the cell-binding property of its B subunit, for the generation of other oral vaccines, we have genetically replaced the toxic A1 subunit of CT with a 42-kDa segment of a streptococcal protein adhesin. This construct was expressed in Escherichia coli as a chimeric protein that retained the GM1 ganglioside-binding activity of CT subunit B and the antigenicity of the streptococcal adhesin, as shown by GM1-ELISA developed with Abs to the steptococcal segment. The protein composition of chromatographically purified chimeric protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with Abs to both antigenic components of the construct. Peroral administration of this chimeric immunogen in mice elicited high levels of mucosal IgA and serum IgG Abs to the streptococcal adhesin, which persisted for at least 6 mo. This strategy allows the development of similar constructs from other candidate Ags for oral immunization against a variety of mucosally acquired infections.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and specificity of dextranase inhibitor (Dei) expressed from Streptococcus sobrinus UAB108 gene cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The dextranase inhibitor gene (dei) from Streptococcus sobrinus UAB108 was previously cloned, expressed, and sequenced. Its gene product (Dei) has now been purified as a single band with apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activity of Dei increased 121-fold upon purification. Most Dei activity (91.2%) was located in the periplasmic fraction from recombinant Escherichia coli cells. Dei competitively inhibits dextranase (Dex). This competitive inhibition mechanism has been further shown by detection and recovery of the intermediate enzyme-inhibitor (Dex-Dei) complex by gel filtration technology using fast protein liquid chromatography. Calibration of their molecular masses indicated that native Dei exists as a tetramer, Dex exists as dimer, and the Dex-Dei complex consists of two Dex molecules with two Dei molecules. Deletion analysis indicates that the intact Dei molecule is essential for Dei activity but not for glucan binding and immune cross-reaction. Dei is a special kind of glucan-binding protein with ability to inhibit Dex with high specificity. It can inhibit endogenous Dex, which can make more branches in glucan with the cooperation of the glucosyltransferase GTF-I. This inhibition cause the accumulation of water-soluble glucan. The latter reaction product can inhibit plaque formation and adherence of the mutans group of streptococcal cells. Dei derived from S. sobrinus UAB108 can inhibit only Dex from S. sobrinus (serotypes d and g), S. downei (previously S. sobrinus, serotype h), and S. macacae (serotype h). This finding suggests that Dei is another important protein existing in some serotypes of the mutans group of streptococci which participates in sucrose metabolism through its interaction with Dex.
TI  - Cross-species complementation of the indispensable Escherichia coli era gene highlights amino acid regions essential for activity.
AB  - Era is an essential GTP binding protein in Escherichia coli. Two homologs of this protein, Sgp from Streptococcus mutans and Era from Coxiella burnetii, can substitute for the essential function of Era in E. coli. Site-specific and randomly generated Era mutants which may indicate regions of the protein that are of functional importance are described.
TI  - Persistence of 99mTc-labelled microorganisms on surfaces of impression materials.
AB  - Impression materials or prostheses can be contaminated with oral microflora and provide a significant source for cross-contamination. A study of such contamination was carried out using an approach different from that of infection control, which has often been investigated in previous studies. The study focused on microorganisms known to cause local and systemic diseases and which are normally found in the oral flora. The persistence of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans (C. albicans) on zinc-oxide eugenol, silicone rubber, irreversible hydrocolloid and polyether-rubber was investigated using 99mTc-labelled microorganisms. Ten specimens from each of the four impression materials were prepared as discs of 3 mm in height and 10 mm in diameter. After the specimens had been placed into a suspension of 99mTc-labelled microorganisms, remaining radioactivity was counted in a gamma counter. According to own findings, S. mutans was the most, and E. coli the least persistent on the specimen surfaces. The number of microorganisms removed after washing was less than the amount remaining on the surfaces. C. albicans was removed most easily from all impression surfaces that bore persistent microorganisms after washing. Other microorganisms showed various degrees of persistence according to the impression material.
TI  - Cold-sensitive conditional mutations in Era, an essential Escherichia coli GTPase, isolated by localized random polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis.
AB  - Conditional cold-sensitive mutations in Era, an essential Escherichia coli GTPase, were isolated. Localized random polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis employing Taq and T7 DNA polymerases under error prone amplification conditions was exploited to generate mutations in the era gene. A plasmid exchange technique was used to identify conditional cold-sensitive mutations in Era that give rise to defective cell growth below 30 degrees C. Three recessive missense mutations in Era, N26S, A156D, and E200K, were isolated. All three mutations are located at residues conserved in Era homologues from Streptococcus mutans and Coxiella burnetti.
TI  - Analysis of glucan synthesis by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Glucan synthesis by Streptococcus mutans GS-5 has been analyzed by examining the  regulation of expression and structure-function relationships of the glucosyltransferases. Primer extension analysis of the gtf genes has identified the putative promoter sequences for these genes and indicated that the -10 sequences are similar to the Escherichia coli consensus sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis as well as deletion analysis of the enzymes have identified amino acid residues as well as functional domains which play important roles in glucan synthesis.
TI  - Transformation of naturally competent Streptococcus mutans with replicative and non-replicative Tn916-containing plasmids: implications for a mechanism of transposition.
AB  - Based on the observations reported here and what is known concerning transformation of naturally competent strains of S. mutans and other streptococcal species such as S. gordonii, we propose the model shown in Figure 2. The Tn916-intermediate transforms S. mutans as originally proposed for B. subtilis by Scott and coworkers [8]. It is not clear in either system (B. subtilis or S. mutans) whether the Tn916 intermediate enters the cell as ds-DNA or ss-DNA. Because it is likely that transformation of B. subtilis via formation of protoplasts involves a mechanism quite different from natural transformation in S. mutans, it would be unwise to extrapolate findings from their studies. If Tn916 enters S. mutans in a manner similar to plasmid or chromosomal DNA, we would assume that Tn916 binds to a cell receptor and as one strand enters, the other is degraded [9]. This leaves open the question of whether Tn916 recircularizes as ds-DNA before it inserts into the chromosome or whether it remains as ss-DNA, if, indeed, it enters as ss-DNA. The transformation efficiency for the Tn916 intermediate (approximately 10(-7) precluded kinetics studies such as those performed with pAM118. Poyart-Salmeron and coworkers [11] however, described a model in which Tn1545 inserts into the target site as a ds-DNA circular molecule, similar to that seen with lambda phage. Perhaps the most interesting finding presented here is that the predominant mechanism of insertion of Tn916 into the chromosome of the recipient occurs after Tn916 enters the cell. The replicative plasmid pAM118 evidently forms by two-hit kinetics followed by intracellular excision and transposition of Tn916. The helper-rescue experiment shows that in this system, the formation of Tcr transformants, and hence the integration of Tn916, was a function of the transformation efficacy of plasmid pAM118. Since intracellular excision of Tn916 probably follows the re-formation of the plasmid pAM118, the rate-limiting step in this system would be the formation of the transient, intracellular plasmid pAM118. (The transient white colony phenotype probably denotes the slower growth rate of transformants that acquire the large replicative plasmid pAM118). Our findings demonstrate that a practical way of promoting Tn916 insertions into chromosomal DNA for the purpose of obtaining mutations is to use a helper-rescue system. Our model supports the concept that the majority of Tn916 inserts arise from a mechanism similar to 'zygotic induction' as proposed for S. sanguis (gordonii) [1]. However, the frequencies for the co-establishment of the replicative plasmid (Emr) and Tn916 inserts (Tcr) in their paper (10(-6)) differ from our observations for S. mutans. We found nearly 100% of Tcr white colonies to be Emr whereas in S. gordonii, only a fraction (approximately 1%) exhibited the TcrEmr phenotype. If both phenotypes arose independently, the frequency of the TcrEmr phenotype would be 10(-8) rather than 10(-6) survivors/recipients as observed. It was surmised that both Tcr and Emr transformants arise dependently [1] where both the Tn916 intermediate and pAM118 contribute to the formation of Tn916 inserts. We conclude from their data, however, that most Tcr arose from the Tn916-intermediate formed in the donor, in agreement with the explanation of these data by Scott [12]. Support for the contention that the Tcr arose in S. gordonii from transformation by the Tn916-intermediate as in S. mutans (yellows), and not from intracellular excision from pAM118, comes from the observation that so few Tcr are Ems and because pAM150 (rep-) yields Tcr at the same frequency as the rep+ pAM118 in their experiments. In summary, the Tn916 intermediate is capable of transforming S. mutans. In contrast to the hypothesis of Scott [12], however, the Tn916 intermediate is not the only form involved in the transformat++t
TI  - Characterization of the dextranase gene (dex) of Streptococcus mutans and its recombinant product in an Escherichia coli host.
AB  - The gene (dex), which encodes the Streptococcus mutans dextranase (Dex), was cloned in Escherichia coli. The E. coli host harboring a recombinant plasmid (pSD2) containing an 8-kb BamHI insert produced a Dex protein of 133 kDa as well as smaller enzymes of 118, 104, and 88 kDa. The Dex produced by the recombinant E. coli was apparently located in the cytoplasmic fraction, not in the periplasmic nor the extracellular fractions. Subcloning and deletion analysis of pSD2 showed that the structural gene of Dex was encoded by a 4-kb BamHI-SalI fragment. The fragment also contained the dex promoter which was effective in the E. coli cell.
TI  - Cloning and DNA sequencing of the dextranase inhibitor gene (dei) from Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - Some dextranase-deficient (Dex-) mutants of Streptococcus sobrinus UAB66 (serotype g) synthesize a substance which inhibits dextranase activity (S.-Y. Wanda, A. Camilli, H. M. Murchison, and R. Curtiss III, J. Bacteriol. 176:7206-7212, 1994). This substance produced by the Dex- mutant UAB108 was designated dextranase inhibitor (Dei) and identified as a protein. The Dei gene (dei) from UAB108 has been cloned into pACYC184 to yield pYA2651, which was then used to generate several subclones (pYA2653 to pYA2657). The DNA sequence of dei was determined by using Tn5seq1 transposon mutagenesis of pYA2653. The open reading frame of dei is 990 bp long. It encodes a signal peptide of 38 amino acids and a mature Dei protein of 292 amino acids with a molecular weight of 31,372. The deduced amino acid sequence of Dei shows various degrees of similarity with glucosyltransferases and glucan-binding protein and contains A and C repeating units probably involved in glucan binding. Southern hybridization results showed that the dei probe from UAB108 hybridized to the same-size fragment in S. sobrinus (serotype d and g) DNA, to a different-size fragment in S. downei (serotype h) and S. cricetus (serotype a), and not at all to DNAs from other mutans group of streptococci.
TI  - [An in-vitro study of the antimicrobial activity of copper and zinc salts on pure and mixed microbial cultures].
AB  - The authors evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of some copper and zinc salts. The results showed high antimicrobial activity of copper salts versus S. mutans and versus the bacterial association tested in this study.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O2-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans induces both H2O2-forming and H2O-forming NADH oxidases in the presence of O2 [M. Higuchi, J. Gen. Microbiol., 130, 1819-1826 (1984)]. In this paper, a nox-1 gene encoding H2O2-forming NADH oxidase (NOX-1) from Streptococcus mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The structural gene of nox-1 consisted of 1530 base pairs, which encode a polypeptide consisting of 510 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,196 Da. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that previously found for the purified NOX-1 protein. The nox-1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of NOX-1 with those of NADH oxidases from other microorganisms showed identities of 55.6%, 20.8%, 20.3%, and 7.3% for those of Amphibacillus xylanus Ep01, Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, Thermoanaerobium brockii Rt8.G4, and Thermus thermophilus HB8, respectively.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - The iron superoxide dismutase of Legionella pneumophila is essential for viability.
AB  - Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, contains two superoxide dismutases (SODs), a cytoplasmic iron enzyme (FeSOD) and a periplasmic copper-zinc SOD. To study the role of the FeSOD in L. pneumophila, the cloned FeSOD gene (sodB) was inactivated with Tn903dIIlacZ, forming a sodB::lacZ gene fusion. By using this fusion, expression of sodB was shown to be unaffected by a variety of conditions, including several that influence sod expression in Escherichia coli: aeration, oxidants, the redox cycling compound paraquat, manipulation of iron levels in the medium, and the stage of growth. A reproducible twofold decrease in sodB expression was found during growth on agar medium containing charcoal, a potential scavenger of oxyradicals, in comparison with growth on the same medium without charcoal. No induction was seen during growth in human macrophages. Additional copies of sodB+ in trans increased resistance to paraquat. Construction of a sodB mutant was attempted by allelic exchange of the sodB::lacZ fusion with the chromosomal copy of sodB. The mutant could not be isolated, and the allelic exchange was possible only if wild-type sodB was present in trans. These results indicate that the periplasmic copper-zinc SOD cannot replace the FeSOD. The data strongly suggest that sodB is an essential gene and that FeSOD is required for the viability of L. pneumophila. In contrast, Sod- mutants of E. coli and Streptococcus mutans grow aerobically and SOD is not required for viability in these species.
TI  - The demonstration by ribotyping of the stability of oral Streptococcus mutans infection over 5 to 7 years in children.
AB  - The distribution of serotypes and ribotypes of mutans streptococcal isolates obtained from seven unrelated children at 5 and at 10 or 12 yr of age was investigated. For ribotyping, chromosomal DNA from 5 to 13 isolates per subject was digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII. The DNA fragments were electrophoretically separated, blotted on to nylon membrane and hybridized to the plasmid pKK3535, which contains the rRNA operon of the Escherichia coli chromosome. The ribotypes were unique for each child. In five children only one ribotype and serotype (c, e or f) was found. In one child two serotypes (c and f) were found at baseline and only one (serotype c) in the follow-up sample. In one child the same serotype was not found in the baseline (serotype e) and in the follow-up (serotype c) samples. Every child except one had a ribotype that was identical to one found 5-7 yr later. The results suggest that, at the age of 5 yr, infection by Streptococcus mutans has already stabilized and the colonizing strain remains permanent.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the Corynebacterium glutamicum mannose enzyme II and analyses of the deduced protein sequence.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the Corynebacterium glutamicum mannose enzyme II (EIIMan) was determined. The gene consisted of 2052 base pairs encoding a protein of 683 amino acid residues; the molecular mass of the protein subunit was calculated to be 72570 Da. The N-terminal hydrophilic domain of EIIMan showed 39.7% homology with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain of Escherichia coli glucose-specific enzyme II (EIIGlc). Similar homology was shown between the C-terminal sequence of EIIMan and the E. coli glucose-specific enzyme III (EIIIGlc), or the EIII-like domain of Streptococcus mutans sucrose-specific enzyme II. Sequence comparison with other EIIs showed that EIIMan contained residues His-602 and Cys-28 which were homologous to the potential phosphorylation sites of EIIIGlc, or EIII-like domains, and hydrophilic domains (IIB) of several EIIs, respectively.
TI  - Sequence and expression of the genes for HPr (ptsH) and enzyme I (ptsI) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - We report the sequencing of a 2,242-bp region of the Streptococcus mutants NG5 genome containing the genes for ptsH and ptsI, which encode HPr and enzyme I (EI), respectively, of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system. The sequence was obtained from two cloned overlapping genomic fragments; one expresses HPr and a truncated EI, while the other expresses a full-length EI in Escherichia coli, as determined by Western immunoblotting. The ptsI gene appeared to be expressed from a region located in the ptsH gene. The S. mutans NG5 pts operon does not appear to be linked to other phosphotransferase transport system proteins as has been found in other bacteria. A positive fermentation pattern on MacConkey-glucose plates by an E. coli ptsI mutant harboring the S. mutans NG5 ptsI gene on a plasmid indicated that the S. mutans NG5 EI can complement a defect in the E. coli gene. This was confirmed by protein phosphorylation experiments with 32P-labeled phosphoenolpyruvate indicating phosphotransfer from the S. mutans NG5 EI to the E. coli HPr. Two forms of the cloned EI, both truncated to varying degrees in the C-terminal region, were inefficiently phosphorylated and unable to complement fully the ptsI defect in the E. coli mutant. The deduced amino acid sequence of HPr shows a high degree of homology, particularly around the active site, to the same protein from other gram-positive bacteria, notably, S. salivarius, and to a lesser extent with those of gram-negative bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence of S. mutans NG5 EI also shares several regions of homology with other sequenced EIs, notably, with the region around the active site, a region that contains the only conserved cystidyl residue among the various proteins and which may be involved in substrate binding.
TI  - Bactericidal action of tachyplesin I against oral streptococci.
AB  - Tachyplesin I, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. The present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 Streptococcus sanguis, 3 Streptococcus mutans, 9 Streptococcus salivarius and 3 Streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin I, whereas 9 S. sanguis strains were resistant. Interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both Kawasaki disease and Behcet patients. According to the time-kill study, tachyplesin I inhibited irreversibly the growth of S. sanguis, S. mutans and S. salivarius strains within 20 min and an S. milleri strain within 80 min. Although it has been suggested that Escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin I, the present results show that only 3 S. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin I in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. Similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin I in saline than these were in a rich medium.
TI  - L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase deficiency is lethal in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The previously cloned gene for L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from Streptococcus mutans was mutagenized in vitro. An Escherichia coli transformant which expressed a thermolabile LDH activity was identified. The ldh(Ts) gene was introduced into S. mutans on a suicide vector to create a heterodiploid expressing both wild-type and thermolabile LDH activities. Self-recombinants which had only one ldh gene were isolated. One of these clones expressed only the thermolabile LDH activity. This isolate grew well at 30 degrees C but did not grow at 42 degrees C under a variety of cultivation conditions, thereby proving that LDH deficiency is lethal in S. mutans in the absence of compensatory mutations.
TI  - Comparative cell targeting in vitro using the CO2 laser.
AB  - In keeping with current interest in bactericidal effects of lasers to treat localized infection, we examined the effect of CO2 laser light on three bacterial species. Cell monolayers were placed atop filters minimizing the presence of extracellular water. Samples were exposed to irradiance values between 0 and 520 W/cm2 for 0.1 s. Cell survival was determined by colony counts. There was logarithmic killing of the bacteria with increasing irradiance; 90% kill was effected at 180 W/cm2 for Escherichia coli, 350 W/cm2 for Streptococcus mutans, and 250 W/cm2 for Bacillus stearothermophilus. However, standard deviations suggest no significant difference between cell types. Our results show the bactericidal effect of the CO2 laser with no remarkable difference between Gram types. However, substantial cell kill was achieved at relatively low irradiance. Whereas selectivity of damage may not be afforded by the CO2 laser, it may minimize collateral damage.
TI  - Inactivation of the Streptococcus mutans wall-associated protein A gene (wapA) results in a decrease in sucrose-dependent adherence and aggregation.
AB  - A 0.8-kb HindIII-BamHI internal fragment of the Streptococcus mutans wall-associated protein A gene (wapA) was ligated to the 5.1-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment of the chimeric Streptococcus-Escherichia coli plasmid pVA891 (Emr Cmr). The resulting construct was used to transform S. mutans GS-5, and erythromycin-resistant mutants were isolated and analyzed. Directed mutagenesis of the wapA gene by plasmid insertion through homologous recombination was demonstrated by Southern blot hybridization with the wapA and pVA891 probes. Stable mutants were obtained, and the alteration of the wapA gene by insertional inactivation was associated with a significant decrease in S. mutans sucrose-dependent aggregation and binding to smooth surfaces. Thus, WapA may play an important role in the colonization of the tooth surface by S. mutans and in the buildup of dental plaque. These findings provided an explanation for previous studies which indicated that WapA was effective in the prevention of dental caries in animal models. Thus, the use of recombinant WapA in the preparation of a safe and effective human dental vaccine should be investigated further.
TI  - Isolation and sequence analysis of the pmi gene encoding phosphomannose isomerase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding a phosphomannose isomerase from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was identified immediately downstream from the fructokinase gene, scrK. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed an open reading frame (ORF) specifying a putative protein of 316 amino acids. The gene cloned in Escherichia coli expressed strong phosphomannose isomerase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of the pmi gene has no significant similarity with any of the previously reported phosphomannose isomerase enzymes. Insertional inactivation of the upstream gene, scrK, in S. mutans also drastically reduced phosphomannose isomerase activity and the ability of the organism to utilize mannose as a sole carbon source. These results suggest that the S. mutans pmi gene constitutes an operon with the scrK gene.
TI  - A protein fragment of streptococcal cell surface antigen I/II which prevents adhesion of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Attachment of Streptococcus mutans to the tooth surface involves a cell surface protein with an M(r) of 185,000, termed streptococcal antigen (SA) I/II. Four overlapping fragments of the gene encoding SA I/II were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant polypeptides were assayed for adhesion-binding activity to salivary receptors and for recognition by a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against SA I/II. Two of the MAbs which are known to prevent colonization of S. mutans in vivo bound the recombinant polypeptide comprising residues 816 to 1161. In vitro adhesion of S. mutans to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also inhibited specifically by a polypeptide (residues 816 to 1213) encompassing the same region. The evidence from the MAbs preventing colonization of S. mutans and the adherence inhibition assay suggests that an adhesion-binding activity resides within the portion of SA I/II comprising residues 816 to 1213, which is highly conserved among oral streptococcal species.
TI  - Construction of recombination-deficient strains of Streptococcus gordonii by disruption of the recA gene.
AB  - Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a region of the recA sequence of Streptococcus gordonii Challis. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the suicide vector pAM6199 and introduced into strain Challis, giving rise to recombination-deficient strains in which the recA gene was specifically inactivated.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a STreptococcus mutans mutant altered in environmental stress responses.
AB  - A mutant defective in aciduricity, GS5Tn1, was constructed following mutagenesis  of Streptococcus mutans GS5 with the conjugative transposon Tn916. The mutant grew poorly at acidic pH levels and was sensitive to high osmolarity and elevated temperatures. These properties resulted from a single insertion of Tn916 into the GS5 chromosome, and the DNA fragment harboring the transposon was isolated into the cosmid vector, charomid 9-20. Spontaneous excision of Tn916 from the cosmid revealed that Tn916 inserted into a 8.6-kb EcoRI fragment. On the basis of the restriction analyses of insert fragments, it was found that Tn916 inserted into a 0.9-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this fragment indicated the presence of two open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2. By using a marker rescue strategy, a 6.0-kb HindIII fragment including the target site for Tn916 insertion and the 5' end of ORF1 was isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences of ORF1 and ORF2 showed significant homology with the diacylglycerol kinase and Era proteins, respectively, from Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Tn916 insertion junction region in the GS5Tn1 chromosome revealed that the transposon inserted near the 3' terminus of ORF1. Restoration of ORF1 to its original sequence in mutant GS5Tn1 was carried out following transformation with integration vector pVA891 containing an intact ORF1. The resultant transformant showed wild-type levels of aciduricity as well as resistance to elevated temperatures and high osmolarity. These results suggest that the S. mutans homolog of diacylglycerol kinase is important for adaptation of the organism to several environmental stress signals.
TI  - Enhanced transformation of Streptococcus mutans by modifications in culture conditions.
AB  
TI  - Genetic organization of the streptokinase region of the Streptococcus equisimilis H46A chromosome.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of four genes and one open reading frame (ORF1) adjacent to the streptokinase gene, skc, from Streptococcus equisimilis H46A were determined. These genes are encoded on the opposite DNA strand to skc and are arranged as follows: dexB-abc-lrp-skc-ORF1-rel. The dexB gene, coding for an alpha-glucosidase (M(r) 61,733), and abc, encoding an ABC transporter (M(r) 42,080), are similar to the dexB and msmK genes, respectively, from the multiple sugar metabolism operon of S. mutans. The lrp gene specifies a leucine-rich protein (M(r) 32,302) that has a leucine-zipper motif at its C-terminus. The function of the Lrp protein is not known but appeared to be detrimental when overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Although lrp appears not to be an essential gene, as judged by plasmid insertion mutagenesis, it is conserved in all streptococcal strains carrying a streptokinase gene. The rel gene showed significant homology to the E. coli relA and spoT genes involved in the stringent response to amino acid deprivation. Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of Rel (M(r) 83,913), RelA and SpoT revealed 59.4% homology of the primary structures. Northern hybridization analyses of the genes in the skc region showed skc to be transcribed most abundantly. In addition to transcripts for skc, monocistronic mRNAs were detected for all three genes divergently transcribed from skc. Although there was also some read-through transcription from lrp into abc, and from abc into dexB, the transcription pattern suggests a high degree of transcriptional and functional independence not only of skc but also abc and dexB. Prominent structural features in intergenic regions included a static DNA bending locus located upstream and a putative bidirectional transcription terminator downstream of skc.
TI  - Glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation in the oral bacterium Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Actinomyces viscosus T14V, a Gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. Basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 U) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. Further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl cAMP. Glucose, on the other hand, stimulated cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Fructose and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on cAMP accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. Other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were without effect. Glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate cAMP accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. Glucose did not stimulate cAMP levels in other Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. salivarius but did cause cAMP accumulation in other strains of A. viscosus. The results suggest that glucose effects on cAMP metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for Escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the A. viscosus bacteria. The results also suggest that glucose stimulates cAMP accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.
TI  - Construction of a model secretion system for oral streptococci.
AB  - A DNA fragment corresponding to the secretory domain from the Streptococcus mutans GS-5 gtfB gene, which encodes the putative 38-amino-acid signal peptide of the glucosyltransferase I (GTF-I) enzyme product, has been constructed. This fragment was fused with the alpha-amylase structural gene from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain 707. This hybrid gene as well as the intact amylase gene were introduced into an Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector consisting of three components: the E. coli replicon p15Aori from pACYC177, an erythromycin resistance gene from pAM beta-1, and the streptococcal replicon from pVA838. Transformation of the oral noncariogenic bacterium Streptococcus gordonii with the chimeric plasmid harboring the hybrid amylase gene resulted in strong extracellular amylase production. By contrast, transformants containing the intact amylase gene exhibited only trace amounts of amylase activity in culture fluids. Since the two signal peptide structures of the GTF-I enzyme and the Bacillus amylase are distinct from each other, these differences might result from the inability of S. gordonii to correctly process the Bacillus signal peptide. Furthermore, culture fluids from transformants of S. mutans as well as Streptococcus milleri harboring the hybrid amylase gene showed only weak amylase activity. Deletion of the gtfB, gtfC, or ftf gene from S. mutans GS-5 did not increase amylase secretion following transformation with the hybrid amylase gene. These results suggest that in contrast to S. gordonii, the inability of S. mutans and S. milleri to secrete hybrid amylase molecules could result from incorrect interaction of the secretory components of these organisms with amylase precursor molecules.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the Neisseria meningitidis asd gene.
AB  - The asd mutants of Gram- and some Gram+ bacteria have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP), an essential constituent of the cell wall of these organisms. In environments deprived of DAP, i.e., mammalian tissues, they will undergo lysis. This has previously been exploited to develop vaccine strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus mutans. As a first step for the development of a biosafe Neisseria meningitidis laboratory strain, we have cloned the asd from wild-type strain B16B6 by complementation of an Escherichia coli asd mutant. By subcloning and insertion mutagenesis, the N. meningitidis asd was localized to a 1.5-kb DNA fragment. In a T7 RNA polymerase-T7 promoter expression system, a 38-kDa protein was strongly expressed from this DNA fragment. The N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence was deduced from the nucleotide sequence, which was determined with the help of an in-frame Asd'::'LacZ protein fusion. A comparison of the N-terminal aa of the Asd proteins from N.meningitidis and E. coli revealed 70% identity, suggesting that the Asd protein may be highly conserved among Gram- bacteria.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a negative regulator of Streptococcus sobrinus surface protein antigen gene.
AB  - Mutans streptococci have been shown to give rise to variants in terms of expression of surface protein antigens by repeated subculturing of the organisms, which in turn induces changes in colonial morphologies. A 2,850-bp upstream region of the gene (pag) for a surface protein antigen, PAg, of Streptococcus sobrinus MT3791 was determined. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the existence of three open reading frames (ORFs) located upstream of the pag gene. ORF1 extended from an undetermined further upstream sequence to the termination codon TAG lying 1,943 bp upstream of the pag gene. ORF2, consisting of 609 bp lying 1,689 bp upstream of the pag gene, encoded a protein of 23,347 Da and a protein of 22,792 Da. The synthesis of these proteins (protein antigen regulators) was demonstrated by using the in vitro T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system. ORF3, extending from 314 bp upstream of the pag gene to 712 bp upstream of the pag gene, encoded a protein of 14,802 Da. Disruption of chromosomal ORF2 of parent strain MT3791 by allelic exchange resulted in isogenic mutants, termed PAREm-1 and PAREm-2, that synthesized larger amounts of cell-free and cell-associated PAg than did the parent strain. RNA dot blot analysis demonstrated that expression of PAg-specific mRNA transcripts by mutants PAREm-1 and PAREm-2 was about 32-fold higher than that by strain 3791. Mutants PAREm-1 and PAREm-2 were found to be more hydrophobic than strain MT3791. Resting cells of these mutants attached in larger numbers to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite than did those of the parent strain. These results suggest that protein antigen regulator regulates the expression of PAg gene in a negative fashion, affecting the colonization of tooth surfaces by the organism. Thus, ORF2 is concluded to be a negative regulator gene of PAg synthesis and was designated par.
TI  - Sequence analysis of scrA and scrB from Streptococcus sobrinus 6715.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 scrA and scrB, which encode sucrose-specific enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, respectively, have been determined. These two genes were transcribed divergently, and the initiation codons of the two open reading frames were 192 bp apart. The transcriptional initiation sites were determined by primer extension analysis, and the putative promoter regions of these two genes overlapped partially. The gene encoding enzyme IIScr, scrA, contained 1,896 nucleotides, and the molecular mass of the predicted protein was 66,529 Da. The hydropathy plot of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that enzyme IIScr was a relatively hydrophobic protein. The gene encoding sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, scrB, contained 1,437 nucleotides. The molecular mass of the predicted protein was 54,501 Da, and the encoded enzyme was hydrophilic. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two open reading frames exhibited approximately 45 and 70% identity with those encoded by scrA and scrB, respectively, from Streptococcus mutans GS5. Homology also was observed between the N-terminal region of the S. sobrinus 6715 enzyme IIScr and other enzyme IIs specific for the glucopyranoside molecule, all of which generate glucopyranoside-6-phosphate during translocation and phosphorylation of the respective substrates. The sequence of the C-terminal domain of the S. sobrinus 6715 enzyme IIScr shared significant homology with enzyme IIIGlc from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and with the C-terminal domain of enzyme IIBgl from E. coli, indicating that the two functional domains, enzyme IIScr and enzyme IIIScr, were covalently linked as a single polypeptide in S. sobrinus 6715. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product of S. sobrinus scrB shared strong homology with sucrase from Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Vibrio alginolyticus, suggesting conservation based on the physiological roles of these proteins.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrK gene encoding fructokinase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding an ATP-dependent fructokinase from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was  identified within a 2 kb DNA fragment immediately downstream from the scrA gene. The gene cloned in Escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. Insertional inactivation of this gene in S. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an ORF starting 199 bp downstream from the scrA gene, preceded by potential ribosome-binding (Shine-Dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. This ORF specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 31,681. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrK, from S. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli plasmid pUR400 or Vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a comparable gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
TI  - Identification of several rod loci and cloning of the rodD locus of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Previous work has shown that Streptococcus mutans is normally a short rod or a sphere, depending on its environment. This paper describes two distinct genetic approaches used to identify multiple loci and isolate one locus, rodD, controlling S. mutans rod shape. The first method involved isolation of a group of rod- mutants caused by transposon Tn916 insertion, and analysis of the inactivated genes by Southern hybridization. The second method involved mutagenesis via a shotgun insertion-duplication technique, isolation of a rod- mutant, and cloning the intact rod locus, employing an integration shuttle plasmid, pVA891. These approaches have led to the identification of multiple rod loci involved in determining the rod shape of S. mutans, and also cloning of one rod locus, rodD. The cloning strategy may also be useful for cloning other streptococcal genes which cannot be detected by their expression in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Identification of a salivary agglutinin-binding domain within cell surface adhesin P1 of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - DNA encoding the alanine-rich region (A-region) of the cell surface adhesin, P1,  from Streptococcus mutans was subcloned and expressed as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) of Escherichia coli. The A-region fusion protein was shown to competitively inhibit both adherence of S. mutans to salivary agglutinin-coated hydroxyapatite and fluid-phase agglutinin-mediated aggregation of this organism. MBP alone or an MBP-paramyosin fusion protein was not inhibitory. Proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein into its component moieties, MBP and A-region, resulted in breakdown of the A-region into three main fragments. Western immunoblot analysis of calcium-dependent agglutinin binding to this preparation revealed binding specificity for a 28-kDa fragment. Thus, the A-region of P1 is an important domain which interacts directly with salivary agglutinin, and this interaction interferes with both the aggregation and the adherence mechanisms in vitro.
TI  - Effects of a streptococcal lipoteichoic acid on complement activation in vitro.
AB  - This study describes activation of serum complement by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Streptococcus mutans OMZ 176, while in solution. Serum from 16 healthy students was taken. Test samples were incubated with increasing doses (1-5,000 micrograms/ml) of LTA or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 for 1 h at 37 degrees C; then assayed for degradation of C3, C4 or factor B by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Each preparation caused a significant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent conversion of C3. The response curves obtained were not statistically different. LPS was a stronger activator of the alternative pathway than LTA, as judged from analysis of C3 degradation in the presence of Mg2+/EGTA, and from their effects on factor B cleavage. LTA caused, however, pronounced alterations in the shape of C4 precipitation in the gels. Functional (hemolytic) assays showed that, when tested at 200 micrograms/ml, LTA and LPS triggered significant (p < 0.05) consumptions of both classical and alternative pathway proteins. LPS was a significantly (p < 0.05) stronger activator than LTA. Apparently, the C3 degradation found for this LTA involved the alternative pathway to a small extent; thus some other mechanism of fluid-phase C3 cleavage seemed also to be operative.
TI  - MsmE, a lipoprotein involved in sugar transport in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Metabolic labelling by [14C]palmitic acid showed that growth of Streptococcus mutans LT11 in raffinose, an inducer of the msm operon, resulted in increased production of a 45-kDa lipoprotein corresponding to MsmE, which is believed to be a sugar-binding protein. MsmE was also labelled when an msmE clone was expressed in Escherichia coli. The presence of a lipid anchor on MsmE provides a likely explanation of how the sugar-binding protein component of the msm binding protein-dependent multiple sugar transport system is retained at the cell surface.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the multiple sugar metabolism (msm) operon of Streptococcus mutans in heterologous streptococcal hosts.
AB  - The multiple sugar metabolism (msm) operon of Streptococcus mutans is responsible for the uptake and metabolism of a variety of sugars. In order to further characterize the substrate specificities of the transport system, a 12-kb region of DNA containing the entire msm operon was cloned, via a novel two-step integration strategy, into the chromosomes of two heterologous streptococcal strains, Streptococcus gordonii Challis and Streptococcus anginosus Is57, as well as the chromosome of a natural isolate of S. mutans with a deletion of the msm region. These strains are unable to transport or ferment melibiose, raffinose, or isomaltosaccharides, but the newly constructed recombinants gained the ability to ferment all of these sugars. The S. gordonii Challis construct containing msm was shown to transport radiolabelled melibiose, raffinose, isomaltotriose, and isomaltotetraose, and the transport function was also subjected to induction by raffinose, an inducer of the msm operon in S. mutans. The results confirm the role of the msm operon in the transport and metabolism of melibiose, raffinose, and isomaltosaccharides.
TI  - Genetic diversity within isolates of mutans streptococci recognized by an rRNA gene probe.
AB  - A total of 79 clinical isolates of mutans streptococci and five laboratory strains representing serotypes c, d, e, f, and g were genotyped by a nonradioactive hybridization method with the rrnB rRNA operon of the Escherichia coli chromosome as a probe. The hybridization patterns of chromosomal DNA fragments obtained by digestion with restriction endonucleases HindIII, SmaI, and BamHI revealed genotypic heterogeneity among the serotypes and among isolates of the same serotype recovered from unrelated subjects. Diversity also existed among isolates obtained from a single subject. For 5 of 13 subjects studied, two or three genotypes within serotypes were found, while eight subjects harbored the same number of genotypes as serotypes. The data show that the method utilizing the rRNA gene probe is of value in determining the molecular epidemiology of isolates of mutans streptococci.
TI  - Biotin-containing protein as a cause of false positive clones in gene probing with streptavidin/biotin.
AB  - Using a streptavidin/biotin labeling technique, we unintentionally cloned a gene  encoding a biotin carboxyl carrier protein, a subunit of biotin-dependent enzymes, from a genomic library of Streptococcus mutans strain UT-041. In colony lifts, the clone reacted positively to the streptavidin-containing detection system but could not be detected in Southern blot analysis. The amino acid sequence of the gene product, deduced from its nucleotide sequence, demonstrated all the features common to biotin carboxyl carrier proteins from other bacteria, indicating that the biotin carboxyl carrier protein in the clone had produced a "false-positive" (DNA probe-independent) reaction by binding to the streptovidin. To circumvent this problem with the detection system in gene probing in the future, we recommend that all positive clones be screened by direct incubation with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (SA-AP) in the absence of biotin-labeled probe DNA. Clones binding to SA-AP would be considered false positives.
TI  - Effect of monoclonal antibodies on the colonization of rats by Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - Local passive immunization has been suggested as a method of preventing colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. In this study we describe the effect of local application of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) on the colonization of Streptococcus sobrinus. The rats, 37 days old, were divided in 4 groups: group 1 received Mab OMVU10 (Mab reactive with Antigen B of S. sobrinus, IgG2b), group 2 received Clone 24 (Mab reactive with lipid A of Escherichia coli, IgG2b), group 3 received uninoculated culture medium, and group 4 received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mabs were applied 6 times on the surfaces of the molars and the labial surfaces of the incisors of the rats, on days 37, 40, 44, 46, 49 and 54 after birth. After the third application of Mabs, all rats were inoculated with S. sobrinus (day 45). Subsequently, the rats were fed a cariogenic diet containing 20% sucrose and 5% glucose. The rats were killed 34 days after inoculation and the maxillary molars were extracted and homogenized in order to determine the numbers of S. sobrinus. The proportions of S. sobrinus, expressed as a percentage of the total cultivable microflora, in rats which received OMVU10 (group 1) were 23.1 +/- 14.8%, whereas in rats which received Clone 24, culture medium or PBS the levels were 34.5 +/- 11.3%, 40.7 +/- 14.9% and 36.7 +/- 9.7%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the level of colonization of rats which received OMVU10 was significantly lower than that of rats which received Clone 24, culture medium or PBS (p < 0.001, p < 0.013 and p < 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative effectiveness of the cholera toxin B subunit and alkaline phosphatase as carriers for oral vaccines.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether the B subunit of cholera toxin (CtxB) has adjuvant activity over and above serving as a carrier protein for orally administered vaccines. An oligonucleotide that encodes an antigenic determinant (GtfB.1) from the glucosyltransferase B gene (gtfB) of Streptococcus mutans was genetically fused to the 5' terminus of either the CtxB gene (ctxB) or the Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase gene (phoA). The resulting chimeric proteins were expressed in a phoA mutant strain of E. coli and then purified. The antigenicities of the proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using antisera specific for GtfB, CtxB, or PhoA. An equimolar amount of peptide on each carrier was administered by gastric intubation to mice three times at 10-day intervals. Antibody titers to the peptide, CtxB, and PhoA (in the serum, intestine, vagina, saliva, and bronchus) were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Antibody to the peptide was detected only in the sera of mice immunized with the peptide fused to CtxB. No antipeptide antibody was detected in mice immunized with the peptide fused to PhoA. The lack of detectable levels of antipeptide antibody in intestinal lavage fluid was attributed to dilution of the sample beyond the sensitivity of the assay. This was confirmed by cultivation of Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph node tissue from mice orally immunized with the GtfB.1::CtxB chimera. Using this method, antipeptide antibody was detected in the culture fluid. We conclude that CtxB possesses unique properties that allow it to act as more than a simple carrier protein.
TI  - Production, characterization, and application of monoclonal antibodies which distinguish three glucosyltransferases from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Thirty-three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the three glucosyltransferases (GTFs) (GTF-I, -SI, and -S) from Streptococcus mutans were obtained by the fusion of murine myeloma cells (P3X63-Ag8-U1) with spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized with pure GTF-S or partially purified GTF-I from serotype c S. mutans PS14. The immunoreactivities of these MAbs were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting (immunoblotting) with various GTF preparations. GTF-I and GTF-SI were expressed from two Streptococcus milleri or Escherichia coli transformants harboring gtfB or gtfC, respectively. All of the five MAbs raised against the GTF-S from PS14 reacted only with the homologous enzymes. Of these, 8 MAbs reacted only with the gtfB gene product (GTF-I), 4 MAbs reacted only with the gtfC gene product (GTF-SI), and the remaining 16 MAbs reacted with both gene products. The existence of GTF-SI in the purified GTF-I from PS14 was demonstrated by Western blot analysis using the representative monospecific MAbs. Further, the relative levels of the three GTFs in the extracellular and cellular fractions of S. mutans clinical isolates were examined by immunoblot analysis. The findings indicated that the relative level of GTF-SI, unlike that of GTF-I or GTF-S, differed markedly among isolates although the three GTFs were synthesized extracellularly by all the strains.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of the catalytic site of Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases.
AB  - In the present communication molecular genetic approaches have been utilized to confirm the nature of the catalytic site of Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases (GTF)s. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the putative sucrose binding Asp-451 of the GTF-I enzyme from S. mutans GS5 to Glu, Asn, and Thr. All three of the resulting mutated enzymes displayed no detectable sucrase or GTF activities. By contrast, mutation of nearby Asp residues did not markedly reduce enzymatic activity. The inactive enzymes also appear to bind acceptor dextrans as well as the parental enzyme. These results confirm the essential role of Asp-451 of the GTF-I from strain GS5 and analogous Asp residues in other related GTFs in enzymatic activity.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Enhancement of antimicrobial properties of cavity varnish: a preliminary report.
AB  - Bacterial contamination beneath amalgam restorations has been a problem in restorative dentistry. Cavity varnish improves the marginal seal but possesses no antibacterial properties, and chlorhexidine gluconate is a known antimicrobial substance. This study investigated the efficacy of a chlorhexidine gluconate/cavity varnish mixture against Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius, and Escherichia coli. The in vitro results indicated that the addition of chlorhexidine gluconate to cavity varnish improved its antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacR, lacABCD, and lacFE genes encoding the repressor, tagatose 6-phosphate gene cluster, and sugar-specific phosphotransferase system components of the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of lacRABCDF and partial nucleotide sequence of lacE from the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans are presented. Comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. The deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of Lactobacillus casei. Additionally, LacR has sequence homology with the repressor (DeoR) of the Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while LacC is similar to phosphokinases (FruK and PfkB) from E. coli. The primary translation products of the lacRABCDFE genes are polypeptides of 251 (M(r) 28,713), 142 (M(r) 15,610), 171 (M(r) 18,950), 310 (M(r) 33,368), 325 (M(r) 36,495), 104 (M(r) 11,401), and 123 (NH2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. As inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (LacR), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (LacA and LacB), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (LacC), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (LacD), and the sugar-specific components enzyme III-lactose (LacF) and enzyme II-lactose (LacE) of the S. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The nucleotide sequence encompassing the S. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of S. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans serotype c tagatose 6-phosphate pathway gene cluster.
AB  - DNA cloned into Escherichia coli K-12 from a serotype c strain of Streptococcus mutans encodes three enzyme activities for galactose utilization via the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway: galactose 6-phosphate isomerase, tagatose 6-phosphate kinase, and tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. The genes coding for the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway were located on a 3.28-kb HindIII DNA fragment. Analysis of the tagatose proteins expressed by recombinant plasmids in minicells was used to determine the sizes of the various gene products. Mutagenesis of these plasmids with transposon Tn5 was used to determine the order of the tagatose genes. Tagatose 6-phosphate isomerase appears to be composed of 14- and 19-kDa subunits. The sizes of the kinase and aldolase were found to be 34 and 36 kDa, respectively. These values correspond to those reported previously for the tagatose pathway enzymes in Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Molecular characterization and expression of the cell-associated glucosyltransferase gene from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding cell-associated glucosyltransferase (CA-GTase) was cloned from Streptococcus mutans MT8148 into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha by using a low-copy-number plasmid, pMW119. After screening of a gene library with the oligonucleotide probe designed on the basis of a partial amino acid sequence of CA-GTase, a recombinant plasmid, pSK6, that had a 5.6 kb insert carrying the CA-GTase gene was selected. The gene product (recombinant CA-GTase) of pSK6 was expressed by using a lac promoter in pMW119. Western blotting revealed that rCA-GTase reacted with antibody to CA-GTase. rCA-GTase was found to synthesize water-insoluble glucans. Southern blotting indicated that the MT8148 chromosome contained another gene which was homologous to pSK6. A plasmid harboring this gene (pSK16) was also isolated from the gene library, the gene product of pSK16 exhibited GTase activity but ten times lower than that of pSK6.
TI  - Characteristics and cariogenicity of a fructanase-defective Streptococcus mutants strain.
AB  - Polymers of D-fructose produced by a variety of oral bacteria are believed to function as extracellular carbohydrate reserves. Degradation of these polysaccharides in plaque following exhaustion of dietary carbohydrates is thought to contribute to the extent and duration of the acid challenge to the tooth surface and thus to the initiation and progression of dental caries. Streptococcus mutans produces a fructanase, the product of the fruA gene, which is capable of degrading beta(2,6)- and beta(2,1)-linked fructans that are commonly synthesized by dental plaque microorganisms. To evaluate the role of the FruA protein in exopolysaccharide metabolism and to assess the contribution of this enzyme to the pathogenic potential of S. mutans, a fructanase-deficient strain of S. mutans was constructed. Inactivation of a cloned fruA gene was accomplished in Escherichia coli by using a mini-Mu dE transposon, and then an isogenic mutant of S. mutans UA159 was constructed by allelic exchange. Successful inactivation of fruA was confirmed through the use of biochemical assays, Western blotting (immunoblotting) with anti-recombinant FruA antisera, and Southern hybridization. The data indicated that FruA was the only fructan hydrolase produced by S. mutans UA159. Inactivation of fruA had no significant effects on glucosyltransferase or fructosyltransferase activity. In the rat caries model using animals fed a high-sucrose diet and ad libitum, there were no significant differences in the number or severity of smooth surface, sulcal, or root caries elicited by the fruA mutant and the wild-type organism.
TI  - Isolation, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans  mannitol-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the mannitol-specific factor III gene of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, utilizes carbohydrates by means of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS facilitates vectorial translocation of metabolizable carbohydrates to form the corresponding sugar-phosphates, which are subsequently converted to glycolytic intermediates. The PTS consists of both sugar-specific and sugar-independent components. Complementation of an Escherichia coli mtlD mutation with a streptococcal recombinant DNA library allowed isolation of the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (mtlD) and the adjacent sugar-specific mannitol factor III gene (mtlF) from S. mutans. Subsequent transposon mutagenesis of the complementing DNA fragment with Tn5seq1 defined the region that encodes the mtlD-complementing activity, the streptococcal mtlD gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed two complete open reading frames (ORFs) from within the streptococcal mannitol PTS operon. One ORF encodes the mtlD gene product, a 43.0-kDa protein which exhibits similarity to the E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases. The second ORF encodes a 15.8-kDa protein which exhibits similarity to mannitol factor III proteins from several bacterial species. In vitro transcription-translation assays were used to produce proteins of the sizes predicted by the streptococcal ORFs. These data indicate that the S. mutans mannitol PTS utilizes an enzyme II-factor III complex similar to the mannitol system found in other gram-positive organisms, as opposed to that of E. coli, which utilizes an independent enzyme II system.
TI  - Cloning of a locus involved in Streptococcus mutans intracellular polysaccharide  accumulation and virulence testing of an intracellular polysaccharide-deficient mutant.
AB  - The streptococcal transposon Tn916 (Tcr) was used to isolate mutants of Streptococcus mutans altered in glycogen accumulation to investigate whether glycogenlike intracellular polysaccharides (IPS) play an important role in S. mutans-induced caries formation. S. mutans UA130 (serotype c) was transformed with the Escherichia coli plasmid pAM620 (Tn916), and the resultant transposon libraries were screened for glycogen content by iodine staining. A transposon mutant, designated SMS201, demonstrated a glycogen-deficient phenotype on glucose-enriched medium. Quantitative electron microscopy confirmed that IPS concentrations were significantly reduced in SMS201 relative to the wild-type progenitor strain, UA130. Importantly, reversion to wild type correlated at all times with loss of the transposon. Transposon excisants were used to facilitate cloning of the streptococcal gene(s) involved in glycogen biosynthesis and storage. A 2.1-kb chromosomal determinant (glgR) which encodes a putative regulator of S. mutans glycogen accumulation was isolated. A stable deletion mutation (delta glgR) was subsequently generated in E. coli and introduced into S. mutans by allelic exchange. The resultant glycogen synthesis-deficient mutant, SMS203, demonstrated a significantly reduced cariogenic potential (P less than 0.01) on the buccal, sulcal, and proximal surfaces of teeth in germfree rats, relative to animals challenged with the glycogen synthesis-proficient progenitor strain, UA130. These observations confirm previous reports (J. M. Tanzer, M. L. Freedman, F. N. Woodiel, R. L. Eifert, and L. A. Rinehimer, p. 597-616, in H. M. Stiles, W. J. Loesche, and T. L. O'Brien, ed., Proceedings in Microbiology. Aspects of Dental Caries. Special Supplement to Microbiology Abstracts, vol. 3, 1976) which implicate IPS as significant contributors to the S. mutans cariogenic process.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of Streptococcus mutans superoxide dismutase gene and isolation of insertion mutants.
AB  - A gene (sod) encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD) was cloned from Streptococcus mutans in Escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The presumptive amino acid sequence of its product revealed that the SOD is basically of Mn type. Insertional inactivation of the sod gene resulted in the loss of SOD activity in crude extracts, indicating that the gene represents the only functional gene for SOD in S. mutans. Moreover, Southern blot analysis indicated that the S. mutans chromosome had no additional gene which was hybridizable with an oligonucleotide probe specific for an SOD motif. The SOD-deficient mutants were able to grow aerobically, albeit more slowly than the parent strains.
TI  - In vivo inactivation of the Streptococcus mutans recA gene mediated by PCR amplification and cloning of a recA DNA fragment.
AB  - The inactivation of the RecA protein in pathogenic oral streptococci would facilitate genetic analysis of potential virulence factors in these strains. Comparison of recA nucleotide (nt) sequences from a number of bacteria has suggested that two regions of highly conserved RecA amino acid (aa) sequence could be used as a basis for synthesizing degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers with which to amplify recA homologues from the streptococci. Accordingly, primer mixtures were used to amplify a 693-bp fragment of the Streptococcus mutans chromosome by PCR. The amplified fragment was cloned and its identity confirmed via hybridization to an Escherichia coli recA gene probe and by nt sequence determination. The recA homologue fragment from S. mutans GS-5 was 63% and 75% homologous to the deduced aa sequences of the E. coli and Bacillus subtilis RecA enzymes, respectively. The S. mutans recA fragment was mutagenized in vitro via insertional inactivation and returned to the chromosome using allelic exchange. The resulting strains of S. mutans were shown to be substantially more sensitive to UV irradiation than the wild-type strain. Further, the ability to incorporate linear markers into the chromosome was abolished in putative S. mutans recA strains, thus indicating the functional inactivation of RecA in these microorganisms.
TI  - Expression of Streptococcus mutans gtf genes in Streptococcus milleri.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (GTF) genes gtfB and gtfC were ligated into Escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids and introduced into Streptococcus milleri. gtfB transformant KSB8 formed an S. mutans-like rough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed an extracellular GTF-I, of 158 kDa, and two cell-bound GTF-Is, of 158 and 135 kDa. gtfC transformant KSC43 formed a semirough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed primarily an extracellular GTF-SI, of 146 kDa, and two cell-bound GTF-SIs, of 146 and 152 kDa. The extracellular GTFs from KSB8 and KSC43 were purified and characterized. The two types of GTF also reacted specifically with monoclonal antibodies directed against each enzyme. Both enzymes synthesized significant amounts of oligosaccharides, consisting primarily of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well as water-insoluble glucans, containing alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. Insoluble-glucan-synthesizing activities of both enzymes were stimulated (three- to sixfold) by the addition of dextran T10 and were inhibited in the presence of 1.5 M ammonium sulfate. The Km(s) for sucrose and the optimal pHs were also similar for both enzymes. However, when the transformants were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, KSC43 cells, expressing GTF-SI activity, adhered to glass surfaces in vitro, while KSB8 cells, expressing GTF-I activity, did not. These results are discussed relative to the potential role of the gtfB and gftC genes in S. mutans cariogenicity.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for enzymatic amplification of recA sequences  from gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas.
AB  - RecA protein in gram-negative bacteria, especially in Escherichia coli, has been  extensively studied, but little is known about this key enzyme in other procaryotes. Described here are degenerate oligonucleotide primers that have been used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) recA sequences from several gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas. The DNA sequences of recA PCR products from Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Mycoplasma pulmonis were determined and compared. These data indicate that the M. pulmonis recA gene has diverged significantly from recA genes of other eubacteria. It should be possible to use cloned recA PCR products to construct recA mutants, thereby providing the means of elucidating homologous genetic recombination and DNA repair activities in these organisms.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a Streptococcus mutans strain exhibiting polymorphism in the tandem gtfB and gtfC genes.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans UA101, which was previously demonstrated to be highly cariogenic in gnotobiotic rats, exhibited much lower water-insoluble glucan (IG) synthetic activity compared with that of S. mutans GS5 and was unable to express sucrose-dependent colonization of smooth surfaces in vitro. On the basis of Southern and Western blot (immunoblot) analyses, it was demonstrated that, unlike most S. mutans strains, strain UA101 contained a single copy of a gene coding for IG synthesis. The gene was isolated from a clone bank constructed with the plasmid pTH10 clone bank in Escherichia coli and had apparently evolved after homologous recombination of the gtfB and gtfC genes present on the chromosome of a recent ancestor of strain UA101. The enzyme expressed from the gene, gtfBC, was purified to near homogeneity by utilizing a single-step preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system and was characterized. A derivative of strain UA101, UA101LBS, containing a chromosomal insertion of the GS5 gtfC gene was constructed after transformation. UA101LBS exhibited high IG synthetic activity and colonized smooth surfaces in vitro. By utilizing a conventional rat model system involving animals fed a high-sucrose diet, strain UA101 exhibited low levels of smooth surface caries activity relative to Streptococcus sobrinus 6715. By contrast, UA101LBS was as cariogenic as strain 6715. However, sulcal caries occurred equally well with all of the strains tested. These results are evaluated relative to the role of gtf gene products in cariogenicity.
TI  - Cloning of the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene in Escherichia coli from lactose-negative mutants of Streptococcus mutans isolated following random mutagenesis with plasmid pVA891 clone banks.
AB  - In order to mutagenize Streptococcus mutans a marker rescue plasmid, pVA891, was  employed. The plasmid was ligated with Sau3AI digested chromosomal DNA fragments from S. mutans GS-5IS3 and the resultant plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli. These plasmids were then randomly integrated into the chromosome of strain GS-5IS3 following transformation. Lactose-negative transformants were isolated as white colonies on lactose-BTR-Xgal agar plates containing erythromycin. Six lactose-negative mutants representing three different chromosomal sites of integration were isolated from about eight thousand transformants. Mutant chromosomal DNA fragments flanking the plasmids were recovered by a marker-rescue method in E. coli and exhibited phospho-beta-galactosidase activity.
TI  - Efficacy of different irrigation methods and concentrations of root canal irrigation solutions on bacteria in the root canal.
AB  - The effectiveness of two different root canal irrigating solutions, each in two different concentrations or formulations, with two different irrigation methods was compared in vitro by means of bacterial survival determinations. 75 human root canals were enlarged, sterilized and inoculated with a mixed culture of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans. After inoculation, the root canals were irrigated either manually or with an ultrasonic device for equal times (20s) with the same amount (5 ml) of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 2%), Fokalhydran I and Fokalhydran II. Sodium hypochlorite (1% and 2%) was used in a 1:100 dilution. Fokalhydran I and II were used in a 1:10 dilution. In the sodium hypochlorite group, the 1% concentration applied with a syringe proved to be most effective against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans. The least effective concentration and application method against both bacteria species was obtained with 2% NaOCL and ultrasonics. Against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus mutans, a significantly lower effectiveness was found with 2% NaOCL applied with ultrasonics with respect to the rest of the sodium hypochlorite group. Fokalhydran I was significantly better than Fokalhydran II against Escherichia coli. However, no significant differences could be seen against Streptococcus mutans within this group.
TI  - Dye-mediated bactericidal effect of He-Ne laser irradiation on oral microorganisms.
AB  - Little attention has been given to the bactericidal effect of laser irradiation,  particularly using low-power energy lasers. It has been demonstrated that He-Ne laser light has an inhibitory action on dental plaque. The purpose of this study was to investigate the bactericidal effect of He-Ne laser irradiation on cariogenic microorganisms. The bactericidal effect was determined by the formation of a growth-inhibitory zone or by the counting of viable bacterial colonies. Streptococcus sobrinus AHT that is a Gram-positive microorganism was sensitive to He-Ne laser light, but Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative microorganism, was resistant. The effect of several dyes necessary to instigate a bactericidal action was also examined. A growth-inhibitory zone was observed using 10 kinds of blue, purple, or green dyes, which were mainly phenylmethane dyes. The leakage of potassium from S. sobrinus AHT following laser irradiation was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The leakage began to increase following irradiation for 2 min, and reached a plateau following irradiation for 30-60 min. Moreover, to examine some changes in the dye itself following laser irradiation in the absence of bacteria, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and 1H NMR spectra were recorded. In this study, it was indicated that the bactericidal effect on cariogenic bacteria by He-Ne laser irradiation was efficient only in the presence of specific dyes. It is suggested that this laser may be suitable for clinical applications in preventive dentistry.
TI  - Cloning of dapD, aroD and asd of Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae, and nucleotide sequence of the asd gene.
AB  - Metabolites such as diaminopimelate and some aromatic derivatives, not synthesized in mammalian cells, are essential for growth of bacteria. As a first step towards the design of a new human live vaccine that uses attenuated strains of Leptospira interrogans, the asd, aroD and dapD genes, encoding aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, 3-dehydroquinase and tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase, respectively, were cloned by complementation of Escherichia coli mutants. The complete nucleotide sequence of the asd gene was determined and found to contain an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 349 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 38,007. Comparison of this deduced L. interrogans aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase amino acid sequence with those of the same enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Corynebacterium glutamicum revealed 46% and 36% identity, respectively. By contrast, the identity between the L. interrogans enzyme and the Streptococcus mutans or E. coli enzymes was less than 31%. Highly conserved sequences within aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase from the five organisms were observed at the amino and carboxyl termini, and around the cysteine of the active site.
TI  - DNA sequence and in vitro mutagenesis of the gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Previously, the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene of Streptococcus mutans JH1000 was cloned into Escherichia coli (J. D. Hillman, M. J. Duncan, and K. P. Stashenko, Infect. Immun. 58:1290-1295, 1990). In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of 1.29 kb of S. mutans DNA which contained the promoter and protein-coding region of the gene was determined. In vitro disruption of the gene was achieved by deletion of the promoter and a major portion of the protein-coding sequence. Subsequently, a tetracycline resistance gene from S. mutans was inserted at the deletion site as a marker for selection. In addition, evidence from Southern hybridization showed that S. mutans JH1000 contained a single copy of the lactate dehydrogenase gene.
TI  - The carboxyl terminal domain of Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases prevents secretion in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The extracellular glucosyltransferases (GTFs) of Streptococcus mutans are not secreted into the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli when the corresponding gtf genes are isolated in the latter organism. The utilization of both deletion analysis and gtfB: phoA fusions indicate that the signal sequences of the GTFs are functional in E. coli. However, these results further suggest that amino acid sequences present in the carboxyl terminus of the GTFs inhibit secretion through the cytoplasmic membrane in E. coli.
TI  - Construction of scrA::lacZ gene fusions to investigate regulation of the sucrose  PTS of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The scrA gene coding for sucrose EnzymeII of the phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system previously isolated from Streptococcus mutans was fused in vitro to the promoterless lacZ' gene to monitor the expression of the scrA gene. The scrA::lacZ gene fusion was introduced back into S. mutans GS-5IS3 by two independent transformation procedures involving either linear or plasmid DNA to produce both scrA and scrA+ mutants. These mutants should prove useful for analyzing the regulation of sucrose transport in S. mutans.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the Arthrobacter dextranase gene and its expression in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - A bacterial strain, which assimilated dextran and water-insoluble glucan produced by Streptococcus mutans, was isolated from soil. The bacterium produced and secreted potent dextranase activity, which was identified as Arthrobacter sp. and named CB-8. The dextranase was purified and some enzymatic properties were characterized. The enzyme efficiently decomposed the water-insoluble glucan as well as dextran. A gene library from the bacteria was constructed with Escherichia coli, using plasmid pUC19, and clones producing dextranase activity were selected. Based on the result of nucleotide sequencing analysis, it was deduced that the dextranase was synthesized in CB-8 cells as a polypeptide precursor consisting of 640 amino acid residues, including 49 N-terminal amino acid residues which could be regarded as a signal peptide. In the E. coli transformant, the dextranase activity was detected mostly in the periplasmic space. The gene for the dextranase was introduced into Streptococcus sanguis, using an E. coli-S. sanguis shuttle vector that contained the promoter sequence of a gene for glucosyltransferase derived from a strain of S. mutans. The active dextranase was also expressed and accumulated in S. sanguis cells.
TI  - Identification and initial characterization of glucose-repressible promoters of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Three catabolite-repressible promoters from Streptococcus mutans have been isolated. These promoters were identified by utilizing the vector pRQ200 which contains a promoterless amylase-encoding gene, a Gram- origin of replication, and an erythromycin-resistance determinant. A library of S. mutans DNA was constructed in pRQ200, amplified in Escherichia coli and integrated by Campbell-type insertion into the S. mutans chromosome following transformation. Colonies exhibiting amylase production on media lacking an extraneous carbohydrate source were screened for diminished amylase production on media containing glucose. The effect of glucose on these promoters has been characterized using a quantitative spectrophotometric assay of amylase activity.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic analysis of Streptococcus mutans alpha-galactosidase.
AB  - The aga gene coding for alpha-galactosidase in Streptococcus mutans was detected  in a recombinant gene library constructed in phage lambda. The gene was subcloned into plasmid vectors and shown to specify a novel protein of Mr 80,000. Characterization of alpha-galactosidase from S. mutans and from recombinant Escherichia coli expressing aga indicated that the enzyme functions as a tetramer. The amino acid composition of the alpha-galactosidase, deduced from nucleotide sequencing of aga, gave a predicted Mr of 82,022 and revealed regions of homology to alpha-galactosidases encoded by the E. coli Raf plasmids and by Bacillus stearothermophilus. Inactivation of the aga gene in S. mutans resulted in loss of all alpha-galactosidase activity and abolished the ability to ferment melibiose; alpha-glucosidase activity was also lost, due to an indirect effect on the dexB gene.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects from incorporation of disinfectants into gypsum casts.
AB  - Five microorganisms--Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Bacillus subtilis--were placed into the canine, first premolar, first molar, and second molar of sterilized quadrant addition-reaction silicone impressions. Four disinfectant solutions--iodophor, neutral glutaraldehyde, phenol, and sodium hypochlorite--were spatulated with sterilized Type IV stone and vibrated into the intentionally contaminated impressions. The casts were removed at 1 and 24 hours, and the surfaces were swabbed, plated on BHI agar, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 days. Colony forming units were counted. At 1 hour, only sodium hypochlorite and glutaraldehyde effectively reduced the number of bacteria to the negative control. Incorporation of sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, and iodophor into gypsum casts reduced viable bacteria to a level equal to the negative controls at 24 hours.
TI  - Carriage of oral flora on irreversible hydrocolloid and elastomeric impression materials.
AB  - This study assessed the carriage and persistence of oral flora on irreversible hydrocolloid and elastomeric impression materials. In the first part of the study, a single isolate each of Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans were inoculated onto each of two elastomeric and two irreversible hydrocolloid impression surfaces artificially created in vitro. Then the inoculum was discarded, samples of impression material (13 mm in diameter) were removed over a 5-hour period, and the remainder of viable organisms were estimated. In the second part of the study, impressions were made from 21 dentate and eight edentulous patients, and bacterial counts were estimated as described. The results showed twofold to fivefold retention of bacteria on the irreversible hydrocolloids compared with the elastomeric impression surfaces. With all impression materials, the number of viable bacteria retained within 5 hours decreased 65% to 98% except for the "disinfectant" irreversible hydrocolloid Blueprint Asept, which totally destroyed the organisms in less than 3 minutes. It is concluded that the total bacterial "load" on impression surfaces is relatively low and decreases rapidly after impression making. However, disinfection of impression surfaces should be mandatory to prevent cross-infection.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, sequence determination and homologies of streptococcal ATPase-encoding DNAs.
AB  - The highly conserved portion of the catalytic subunit (beta-subunit) of the membrane-bound, proton-translocating ATPase from three strains of oral streptococci has been amplified via the polymerase chain reaction. Hybridization studies demonstrated the existence of homology between Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium beta-subunit probes at the streptococcal DNA level. Highly degenerate primers, based on the E. coli and B. megaterium amino acid (aa) sequences, were used to amplify the homologues in Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis and S. sobrinus. The 600 bp fragment from S. sobrinus has been cloned and its nucleotide (nt) sequence determined. Comparison of its nt and deduced aa sequence to that of E. coli and B. megaterium reveals a high degree of homology at the aa level.
TI  - Purification and characterization of recombinant cell surface protein antigen A of Streptococcus sobrinus B13N.
AB  - 1. It has been reported that immunization of rhesus monkeys with the surface protein antigen I/II from Streptococcus mutans significantly reduced dental caries. 2. The surface protein antigen A (SpaA) from Streptococcus sobrinus is known to correspond antigenically to I/II. MD51 is an Escherichia coli host containing pMD51, a plasmid encoding the SpaA gene from Streptococcus sobrinus B13N. 3. The recombinant SpaA (rSpaA) was purified from cell extracts of Escherichia coli clone MD51. 4. The purified recombinant SpaA was homogeneous with a molecular weight of 210 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and had an isoelectric point of 4.2 based on isoelectric focusing. 5. Amino acid composition of rSpaA showed a relatively high amount of hydrophobic amino acids (39.7%).
TI  - Use of transposon Tn916 to inactivate and isolate a mutacin-associated gene from  Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Among the attributes thought to contribute to the virulence of Streptococcus mutans is its ability to elaborate bacteriocinlike substances, which may provide a selective force enhancing its colonization potential. One such inhibitory substance, mutacin II, is produced by certain plasmid-containing strains of S. mutans. We introduced insertional mutations into a mutacin II-producing strain of S. mutans (UA96) by transformation with a plasmid carrying Tn916, resulting in transformants bearing single inserts of the transposon at different sites within the chromosome. The insertions identify five different EcoRI fragments required for production of mutacin II (Bac phenotype; bac-1 to bac-5 genotypes). The EcoRI fragments, containing bac-1::Tn916 was ligated into a cosmid vector, pJC74, and transduced into Escherichia coli DH1, where Tn916 is known to be unstable. The loss of Tn916 resulted in a 30-kb plasmid, pPC974, containing approximately 15 kb of S. mutans DNA. A Bac-associated DNA fragment was then subcloned into the streptococcus-E. coli shuttle vector pVA838 and transformed into S. mutants, where it was capable of complementing the bac mutation in the Bac- parent. These findings suggest that we have isolated at least one gene associated with mutacin production.
TI  - Aspartokinase genes lysC alpha and lysC beta overlap and are adjacent to the aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene asd in Corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  - A 2.1 kb DNA fragment of the recombinant plasmid pCS2, isolated from an aminoethyl cysteine (AEC)-resistant and lysine-producing Corynebacterium glutamicum mutant strain, and which confers AEC resistance and lysine production on the wild-type G. glutamicum ATCC 13032 was analysed. DNA sequence analysis of this fragment revealed three large open reading frames (ORFs). The incomplete ORF1 does not contain the 5' end of the coding region. ORF2, which uses the same reading frame as ORF1, is identical to the 3' end of ORF1 and encodes a putative protein of 172 amino acids (aa) and of Mr 18,584. ORF3 encodes a putative protein of 344 aa and of Mr 36,275. The amino acid sequences deduced from ORF1 and ORF2 display strong homologies to those of the alpha- and beta-subunits of the Bacillus subtilis aspartokinase II. It is therefore proposed that the incomplete ORF1, termed lysC alpha, encodes part of the alpha-subunit of the C. glutamicum aspartokinase whereas the complete ORF2, termed lysC beta, encodes the beta-subunit of the same enzyme. ORF2 is responsible for AEC resistance and lysine production due to a feedback-resistant aspartokinase. The amino acid sequence deduced from ORF3, termed asd, is highly homologous to that of the Streptococcus mutans aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASD). Plasmids carrying the C. glutamicum asd gene complemented Escherichia coli asd mutants. Increase in ASD activity by a factor of 30-60 was measured for C. glutamicum cells harbouring high copy-number plasmids with the C. glutamicum asd gene.
TI  - Early response in neonatal septicemia. The effect of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and tumor necrosis factor on the generation of lactoferrin.
AB  - Using an in vitro model, we report the early effect of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Streptococcus agalactiea (group B streptococci, GBS) and recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) on the release of lactoferrin (LF) and the generation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) due to E. coli, using heparinized whole blood from healthy full-term newborns. We wanted to find a dose response relationship between lactoferrin generation on the one hand and the amount of E. coli, GBS and TNF on the other hand. In a final concentration of 10(7) per ml both bacteria increased the release of LF significantly. The response to E. coli was immediate and mg/l +/- 0.29 mg/l, E. coli 1.83 mg/l +/- 0.76 mg/l, p less than 0.001). GBS was a less potent stimulant than E. coli and the response was only apparent after 20 minutes (mean +/- S.D.: 1.06 mg/l +/- 0.49 mg/l, p less than 0.01). TNF in a concentration of 10000 pg/ml as well as 1000 pg/ml increased the release of LF significantly (after 20 minutes mean +/- S.D.: 1.09 mg/l +/- 0.42 mg/l and 0.97 mg/l +/- 0.36 mg/l, respectively), whereas a concentration of 100 pg/ml had no effect. Whole blood incubated with different preparations of LF for 20 minutes did not increase the generation of LF significantly. No significant changes in IL-1 levels were observed. Lactoferrin had bacteriostatic but no bactericidal effect on GBS and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Bacterial adherence and contamination during radiographic processing.
AB  - Oral fluids are potential contaminants of radiographic processors. This investigation measured bacterial contamination in a radiographic processing room during times of high and low clinical activity and processing effects on five types of microorganisms. Cultures in the clinical setting, during high and low activity, were taken by brain-heart infusion agar plates placed near automatic processors. Site samples were taken of entrance, developer, fixer, water, and exit surfaces. Measurements of processing effects were accomplished by intentional contamination of films run in series through an automatic processor. Site samples were again taken of the processor. In the clinical setting colony-forming units increased with activity. Radiographic processing after intentional contamination decreased colony-forming units on films, but they increased for all processing solutions. Bacteria on radiographic film survived processing. Although processing procedures significantly reduce the number of bacteria on films, the potential for contamination and cross-contamination remains.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of the Vibrio alginolyticus sucrose uptake-encoding region.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Vibrio alginolyticus sucrose uptake-encoding region was determined, and contained two genes, scrA and scrK. The scrA gene encodes an enzyme IISucrose (EIIScr) protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system and the scrK gene encodes a fructokinase. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence for the V. alginolyticus EIIScr protein was homologous with the EIIScr proteins from Streptococcus mutans, Salmonella typhimurium (pUR400 system) and Bacillus subtilis. The deduced aa sequence for the V. alginolyticus fructokinase was homologous with the Escherichia coli enzymes, 6-phosphofructokinase (isoenzyme 2) and ribokinase. Transposon phoA mutagenesis experiments indicated that the EIIScr protein was a membrane-bound protein with a region that extended into the periplasm.
TI  - A IIIman protein is involved in the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by oral streptococci.
AB  - We show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called IIIman. This protein was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-TSK, hydroxyapatite, and Dyematrex Green A. The purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. However, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and Western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of S. salivarius of 2 different forms of IIIman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. The presence of the high-molecular-weight form of IIIman was observed by immunodiffusion, Western blot and phosphorylation by [32]PEP in S. salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus lactis but not in Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei. Antibodies directed against the IIIman of S. salivarius did not react with the IIIman of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the asd gene of Salmonella typhimurium: use in stable maintenance of recombinant plasmids in Salmonella vaccine strains.
AB  - The asd mutants of Salmonella typhimurium have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and will undergo lysis in environments deprived of DAP. This has allowed the development of a balanced-lethal system for the expression of heterologous antigens in vaccine strains using vectors containing the wild-type asd gene from Streptococcus mutans and asd mutant Salmonella hosts [Nakayama et al., Biotechnology 6 (1988) 693-697]. We have cloned the asd gene from S. typhimurium, characterized the gene product and used this gene to construct Asd+ expression cloning vectors. In addition we have constructed an asd cassette and a transposon derived from Tn5 that allow the rapid modification of other vectors for use with delta asd vaccine strains of S. typhimurium adding versatility to the Asd+ vector/delta asd host system of plasmid maintenance.
TI  - The RNA polymerases of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Western blot analysis that used antisera to the E. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the RNA polymerase of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Both antisera reacted with proteins in A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. mutans whole-cell extracts. Reactions were seen with some F. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core RNA polymerase antisera were used, but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. No reaction with F. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to E. coli sigma factor. There were no cross-reacting proteins detected in P. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. These results suggest that E. coli RNA polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase for E. coli RNA polymerase to recognize P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum promoters. Partially purified P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase exhibited a specificity for a P. gingivalis DNA template, while having a decreased activity from an E. coli DNA template. The antibiotic sensitivity profile of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum RNA polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of E. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. We conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum genes in E. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Streptococcus lactis carrying the Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen gene.
AB  - A recombinant Streptococcus lactis strain which carries the structural gene for a surface protein antigen (PAc) of 190,000 daltons from Streptococcus mutans serotype c was constructed for development of an oral vaccine against dental caries. The gene from S. mutans MT8148 joined to shuttle vector pSA3 was successfully transformed into S. lactis IL1403. A small amount of PAc was detected in the cell homogenate and cytoplasmic fraction of the recombinant S. lactis, but not in the culture supernatant of the recombinant, by Western immunoblotting and dot immunoblotting. The level of PAc-specific mRNA in the recombinant strain was lower than that in S. mutans MT8148. However, significant salivary immunoglobulin A and serum immunoglobulin G responses to PAc were induced in mice immunized orally with the recombinant S. lactis.
TI  - Characterization of the product of the gtfS gene of Streptococcus downei, a primer-independent enzyme synthesizing oligo-isomaltosaccharides.
AB  - The gtfS gene, coding for a glucosyltransferase which synthesizes water-soluble glucan and previously cloned from Streptococcus downei strain MFe28 (mutans serotype h) into a bacteriophage vector, was subcloned into a plasmid vector. The gtfS gene products expressed in Escherichia coli were compared to the primer-independent, oligo-isomaltosaccharide synthase in Streptococcus sobrinus strain AHT (mutans serotype g) and shown to resemble it closely in molecular mass, isoelectric point, immunological properties, optimum pH and Km values. The glucans produced from sucrose by the gtfS gene products are alpha-1,6-linked linear oligo-isomaltosaccharides without any branching sites. A similar gtfS gene was also detected on chromosomal DNA from S. sobrinus strain AHT.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between the immunodominant determinant of the antigen I component of Streptococcus sobrinus SpaA protein and surface antigens from other members of the Streptococcus mutans group.
AB  - Most members of the Streptococcus mutans group of microorganisms specify a major  cell surface-associated protein, SpaA, that is defined by its antigenic properties. The region of the spaA gene from Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 encoding the immunodominant determinant of the major antigenic component (antigen I) of the SpaA protein has recently been characterized. This study examined whether recognition of the immunodominant determinant is independent of the immunized animal host and whether antibodies elicited by the immunodominant determinant cross-react with cell surface proteins from S. mutans of various serotypes. Mouse and rabbit antisera to the undenatured SpaA protein reacted similarly both with the immunodominant determinant and with other antigenic structures of the protein in Western immunoblots with SpaA polypeptides that were specified by spaA gene fragments expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli. This suggests that the antibody responses of inbred and outbred animals were similar. Furthermore, antibodies raised against both the S. sobrinus SpaA immunodominant determinant expressed by recombinant E. coli and the purified protein from S. sobrinus displayed similar strain specificities and protein band profiles towards cells surface proteins from S. mutans of various serotypes in immunodot and Western blot analyses, respectively. This suggests that for S. sobrinus serotype g, the immune response against the SpaA protein is governed by the immunodominant determinant of antigen I. In addition, it indicates that the SpaA protein domain containing the immunodominant determinant overlaps the domain conferring cross-reactivity to cell surface proteins of S. mutans of various serotypes.
TI  - Regions of the Streptococcus sobrinus spaA gene encoding major determinants of antigen I.
AB  - Surface protein antigen A (SpaA), also called antigen B, antigen I/II, or antigen P1, is an abundant cell envelope protein that is the major antigenic determinant of Streptococcus sobrinus and other members of the Streptococcus mutans group of cariogenic bacteria. This laboratory has previously reported the cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a BamHI restriction fragment of S. sobrinus DNA containing most of the spaA gene (pYA726) and encoding antigen I. Regions of spaA encoding immunodeterminants of antigen I were analyzed by either deletion mapping or expressing selected restriction fragments from the trc promoter. SpaA proteins produced by mutants harboring nested deletions, constructed by BAL 31 exonuclease treatment at a unique SstI site located towards the 3' end of the gene, were examined by Western immunoblot with rabbit serum against SpaA from S. sobrinus. Only SpaA polypeptides larger than 56 kilodaltons reacted with anti-SpaA serum. Various restriction fragments of the region of spaA encoding the antigenic determinants were cloned into an expression vector. The immunoreactive properties of the polypeptides encoded by those fragments indicated that expression of the immunodominant determinant required topographically assembled residues specified by noncontiguous regions located within 0.48-kilobase PvuII-to-SstI and 1.2-kilobase SstI-to-HindIII fragments which were adjacent on the spaA map.
TI  - Sequence and structural characteristics of the trypsin-resistant T6 surface protein of group A streptococci.
AB  - The gene for the trypsin-resistant surface T6 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes D471 (M type 6) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene (tee6) and its flanking regions was determined and found to include only one major open reading frame coding for a protein of 537 amino acids (Mr, 57,675). The N terminus of the deduced protein sequence exhibits features of a typical signal sequence, and the C-terminal segment was found to have a high degree of homology with the membrane anchor region of other gram-positive surface proteins, such as streptococcal M protein, wapA protein from Streptococcus mutans and staphylococcal protein A. A hexapeptide having the consensus sequence LPSTGE and located immediately upstream of the C-terminal hydrophobic segment showed the highest degree of conservation at both the protein and DNA levels, with nearly all reported surface proteins from gram-positive cocci. The amino acid composition of the T6 protein revealed 21% serine and threonine residues distributed nearly regularly throughout the molecule, and analysis of the secondary structure predicted a conformation composed of greater than 70% beta-sheet potential interrupted by beta-turns or random coils. Localization experiments in E. coli show very little T6 protein in the periplasmic space. When found here, however, this T6 protein had a molecular mass of 55 kilodaltons, similar to that extracted from the streptococci by nonionic detergent. Most of the T6 protein was found localized in the membrane fraction, where it was composed of a triple band of 60, 58, and 57 kilodaltons. The coexistence of streptococcal surface proteins which are either resistant (T protein) or sensitive (M protein) to proteolytic enzymes may offer a new dimension to the modulation of these antigens under specific biological conditions.
TI  - [Molecular cloning and expression of a dextranase gene from Arthrobacter in Streptococcus sanguis].
AB  - The gene coding for a dextranase activity of Arthrobacter CB-8, named dex gene, was isolated and cloned into Escherichia coli and into Streptococcus sanguis. The gene library was screened by transparent halo formation around the colonies grown on agar medium containing blue dextran. DNA fragment consisting of about 3,200 base pairs was prepared for further cloning procedures. Dextranase activity was detected in the periplasmic space of E. coli clones, using pUC19, pVA 838 and their derivatives. Dex gene was also introduced into S. sanguis Challis using pVA 838, a plasmid that is able to replicate in both E. coli and S. sanguis. But the clones did not express the dex gene. For the expression of dex gene in S. sanguis, a new shuttle vector was constructed, which contained the promoter region of a glucosyltransferase gene from S. mutans as well as the terminator region of ribosomal RNA from E. coli. The plasmid was designated pMNK. Using pMNK as vector, dex gene was expressed in S. sanguis. Dextranase activity was detected in the cellular fraction of the clones.
TI  - Streptococcal-host interactions. Structural and functional analysis of a Streptococcus sanguis receptor for a human salivary glycoprotein.
AB  - Colonization of oral tissues by Streptococcus sanguis may be influenced by a mucin-like salivary glycoprotein (SAG) through a calcium-dependent interaction with a specific bacterial receptor. We report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the S. sanguis receptor (SSP-5) and show that this protein may bind sialic acid residues of SAG. The SSP-5 protein contains three unique structural domains, two of which consist of repetitive amino acid sequences. The N-terminal domain is comprised of four tandem copies of an 82-residue repeat which exhibits homology to M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. This region is highly charged and predicted to be alpha-helical. A second hydrophilic repetitive domain consists of three copies of a 39-amino acid sequence containing 30% proline flanked by nonrepetitive proline-rich sequence. The third domain consists of 48% proline and resides near the C terminus of the protein. Secondary structure analysis of the SSP-5 sequence also identified four potential helix-turn-helix motifs that resembled E-F hand calcium binding domains. The SSP-5 protein is highly homologous to a surface antigen expressed by the mutans streptococci and the domain structure of SSP-5 is conserved within this family of proteins. The interactions of SSP-5 and of intact S. sanguis with SAG were inhibited by neuraminidase digestion of the salivary glycoprotein and by simple sugars containing sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is the primary ligand involved in the binding reaction.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus mutans JH1000 was purified by a modification of published methods. The sequence of 27 amino-terminal amino acids was determined, which allowed us to construct a 17-base DNA probe that had 32-fold degeneracy. The probe was used to screen a genomic library in pBR322. Of 18 reactive clones, 1 was found that expressed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity identical to that of S. mutans with regard to dependence on fructose-1,6-diphosphate, thermal inactivation profile, and inhibition by sodium oxamate. Extracts of this clone possessed a protein band that comigrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with purified LDH from JH1000. Compared with controls, the clone was shown to produce elevated amounts of L-(+)-lactic acid during growth in the presence of glucose, thereby indicating that the activity was expressed in vivo. This result was substantiated by demonstrating that the activity could complement a mutation in the fermentative D-(-)-LDH of Escherichia coli. Subcloning showed that the S. mutans LDH subunit is encoded by a 1.2-kilobase gene. Our ability to clone this gene is expected to have great practical significance in the construction of an effector strain for use in the replacement therapy of dental caries.
TI  - Conservation of the regulatory subunit for the Clp ATP-dependent protease in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
AB  - Bacteria, tomatoes, and trypanosomes all contain genes for a large protein with extensive homology to the regulatory subunit, ClpA, of the ATP-dependent protease of Escherichia coli, Clp. All members of the family have between 756 and 926 amino acids and contain two large regions, of 233 and 192 amino acids, each containing consensus sequences for nucleotide binding. Within these regions there is at least 85% similarity between the most distant members of the family. The high degree of similarity among the ClpA-like proteins suggests that Clp-like proteases are likely to be important participants in energy-dependent proteolysis in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Humoral immunity in root caries in an elderly population. 1.
AB  - IgA, IgG and IgM antibody activity (ELISA Units/ml) to Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscous and Escherichia coli CF8 in serum, parotid saliva and whole saliva was measured using the amplified ELISA (a-ELISA) while the concentration (microgram/ml) of each isotype of immunoglobulin as well as albumin and lactoferrin, was determined using sandwich ELISAs. Selection of suitable reagents from those commercially available was based on specificity tests using purified human immunoglobulin; most polyclonal reagents required further absorption to attain class specificity. Cross-absorption studies indicated the absence of patient antibodies that were cross-reactive among the bacteria studied, except for IgM in some cases. Expression of response in ELISA Units (E.U.) per microgram of immunoglobulin, i.e. specific activity, revealed that IgG specific activity was significantly higher in parotid saliva than in either whole saliva or serum for all bacteria studied; serum and whole saliva did not differ except for the higher specific activity in whole saliva to E. coli. The value of one E.U. was determined using the Comparative Antibody-immunoglobulin Capture Assay (CACA). Using this novel method, we estimated that about 0.05 percent of serum IgA was specific for Streptococcus mutans, 0.008 for Actinomyces viscosus and 0.004 for Escherichia coli CF8. The percentage of specific IgM antibodies was higher than for IgA and IgG. The concentration of IgA anti-Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Escherichia coli levels are approximately 92 ng/ml, 25 ng/ml and 16 ng/ml in whole saliva and 46 ng/ml, 9.4 ng/ml and 6.3 ng/ml in parotid saliva.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Surface hydrophobicity, adherence, and aggregation of cell surface protein antigen mutants of Streptococcus mutans serotype c.
AB  - The pac gene of the serotype c strain Streptococcus mutans MT8148 encodes a cell  surface protein antigen (PAc) of approximate 190 kilodaltons. The serotype c strain S. mutans GS-5 does not produce the 190-kilodalton PAc but produces a lower-molecular-weight protein that reacts with anti-PAc serum. The SphI-BamHI fragment of the pac gene was ligated with the S. mutans-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pSA3. The chimeric shuttle vector was transformed into strain GS-5, and two transformants (TK15 and TK18) were isolated. These transformants produced a large amount of cell-free and cell-bound PAc of 190 kilodaltons. No plasmid was isolated from these transformants, and the EcoRI fragments of their chromosomal DNA hybridized with the erythromycin resistance gene in the shuttle vector DNA, indicating insertion of the chimeric shuttle vector DNA into the chromosomal DNA. The cell hydrophobicity of strains TK15 and TK18 as well as PAc-defective mutants constructed by inserting an erythromycin resistance gene into the pac gene of strain MT8148 was analyzed. Strains MT8148, TK15, and TK18 were hydrophobic. On the other hand, strain GS-5 and PAc-defective MT8148 transformants were hydrophilic. Resting cells of the hydrophobic strains attached in larger numbers to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite than did the hydrophilic strains. Human whole saliva induced the aggregation of cells of the hydrophobic strains but not that of cells of the hydrophilic strains. These results suggest that cell surface PAc of S. mutans serotype c participates in attachment of the streptococcal cell to experimental pellicles.
TI  - [Bacterial penetration of bovine dentinal tubules. 1].
AB  - The penetration by bacteria through dentinal tubules was studied using a device that included portion of bovine anterior teeth. Strains of 4 genera, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, were used for the experiment, and the effects of acid etching of dentin on the penetration of bacteria through the dentin was examined. The time required for penetration through dentinal tubules of acid-etched samples was shorter than that of unetched samples. The minimum time required for half the samples to become positive for bacterial penetration through dentin MPT50 was 4 hours for all strains chosen when the acid-etched dentin was the target. In non-acid etched samples, the MPT50 varied among the genera and ranged from 20 hours to 48 hours; the speed of penetration was Sta. aureus = L. casei greater than Str. mutans greater than E. coli. Observation under the scanning electron microscope indicated that the smeared layer was completely coated on the surface of the prepared cavity, and when bacterial penetration occurred, a portion of the smear layer on the dentin disappeared. In longitudinal sections, the penetration by the bacteria into the tubules was visible. From these results, it is suggested that the smeared layer have an important effects on bacterial penetration through these tubules.
TI  - [Disinfection of toothbrushes. Experimental research].
AB  - Aim of the present paper is to verify in a vitro study, the possible disinfection of the toothbrushes with an UV instrument (Dentec 4000). The modifications in microbic concentration after a contamination with microbial suspension of oral cavity have been estimated.
TI  - Cloning and inactivation of the gene responsible for a major surface antigen on Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - To understand more fully the biological function(s) and investigate the reported  cross-reactivity with heart tissue of antigen P1 (I/II) of Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), this molecular biological study of the responsible gene, spaP, was undertaken. A 5.2 kb Hin dIII fragment of strain NG5 was cloned into Escherichia coli JM109 by a shotgun procedure with pUC18 as the vector. Recombinant SM2949 expressed a P1 fusion protein under the control of the streptococcal promoter. Southern analysis revealed hybridization of pSM2949 with DNA from Strep. mutans (serotypes c, e, f), Strep. cricetus (a) and Strep. sobrinus (d), but not Strep. sobrinus (g), Strep. rattus (b) or Strep. downei (h). Recombinant (r) antigen was detected in E. coli periplasm, indicating the presence of a signal sequence. This product (of Mr 155K) showed partial identity to the native streptococcal P1 antigen by Ouchterlony double-diffusion analysis. The N-terminal 28 amino acid residues of rP1 were determined by Edman degradation analysis and an end-labelled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to residues 8-13 was used to determine the 5'-3' orientation of spaP by Southern hybridization with restriction enzyme digests of pSM2949. Rabbit antisera made against native and rP1 did not cross-react with human heart tissue. Isogenic mutants of strain NG8 were isolated after transformation with insertionally inactivated spaP. Each mutant was non-reactive with anti-P1 antisera. Selected mutants were shown to have a defective spaP gene incorporated into their chromosomal DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cholera toxin B-subunit gene fusion: structural and functional analysis of the chimeric protein.
AB  - A synthetic peptide, encoding amino acid residues 345 to 359 of the glucosyltransferase B enzyme of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, was genetically fused to the N-terminal end of the B-subunit gene of cholera toxin. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and retained the antigenicity associated with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) as well as that associated with glucosyltransferase B. The addition of 15 amino acids to the N-terminal end of CTB did not appear to affect the gross structure of the protein significantly. The chimeric protein monomers assembled into a functional oligomer which exhibited only minor conformational differences from native CTB as measured by circular dichroism. The chimera bound to GM1 ganglioside and thus retained the biological activity of CTB. These results demonstrate that genetic fusion of small peptides to the N terminus of CTB has only a minimal effect on the structure and function of the protein. Furthermore, the chimera was shown to be immunogenic when fed to mice. This work has important implications in the construction of CTB chimeras for use as oral vaccines.
TI  - Immunolocalization of Streptococcus mutans sr gene product in recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - A direct post-embedding immunogold method was used to determine the subcellular localization of the expression product of Streptococcus mutans sr gene in Escherichia coli cells. Immunolabelling was principally localized in the cytoplasm and was absent in the periplasmic space and extracellular compartment. We observed no difference in the localization of the labelling between bacteria originated from solid or liquid cultures. No difference in saliva binding could be observed between recombinant E. coli or control E. coli cells. These results showed that the cloned SR protein was not accessible at the surface of the host cell.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the cloned streptococcal cell surface antigen I/II.
AB  - The gene spa P (formerly designated as spa P1) encoding the Mr 185,000 surface antigen (I/II) of Streptococcus mutans, serotype c (NG5), has been sequenced. The gene (4683 bp) encodes a protein of 1561 amino acid residues including putative signal peptide (residues 1-38) and transmembrane (residues 1537-1556) sequences. The N-terminal region (60-550) has alanine-rich repeats and is predicted to be alpha-helical. However, the C-terminal region (800-1540) is proline-rich and favours an extended structure. Except for a short central variable region the sequences appear to be highly conserved for S. mutans serotype c. N-Terminal sequencing of separated antigen I and antigen II polypeptides suggests that the former represents the N-terminal and the latter the C-terminal portions of the intact antigen.
TI  - Construction and characterization of isogenic mutants of Streptococcus mutans deficient in major surface protein antigen P1 (I/II).
AB  - The gene (spaP) coding for the Streptococcus mutans major surface protein antigen P1 (or I/II) has been cloned into Escherichia coli (S. F. Lee, A. Progulske-Fox, and A. S. Bleiweis, Infect. Immun. 56:2114-2119, 1988). In the present study, this gene has been disrupted in vitro by insertional inactivation with pVA981, which carries a Tcr marker, and transformed into S. mutans NG8 (serotype c) by electroporation. Upon homologous recombination, the defective spaP was integrated into the genome as demonstrated by Southern hybridization analysis. One Tcr mutant, designated 834, selected by its nonreactivity with anti-P1 monoclonal antibodies, was found to lack the cell surface fuzzy layer which was clearly present on the parent cells. Analysis of extracellular fluids, sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized membranes, and cytoplasmic fractions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that 834 had protein profiles identical to the parent. However, a 185-kilodalton protein which reacts with anti-P1 antibodies was missing from the wall of 834, suggesting that spaP has been specifically inactivated. This mutant displayed levels of glucosyltransferase and fructosyltransferase activities similar to those of the parent. It was much less hydrophobic than the parent. S. mutans NG8 aggregated readily in the presence of clarified whole saliva or a high-molecular-weight salivary agglutinin. This strain also adhered to agglutinin-coated hydroxyapatite. The P1-negative mutants, however, did not display these two properties, suggesting that P1 may play a role in saliva-mediated aggregation and adherence.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the Streptococcus mutans gene specifying antigen A.
AB  - A gene encoding a Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen has been isolated  from a strain GS-5 gene bank constructed via the Streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pSA3. This E. coli recombinant clone, designated 4B2, expressed S. mutans proteins, as shown by Western immunoblot analysis with a specific rabbit antibody to S. mutans surface antigens. Three bands were observed, including a 52-kilodalton (kDa) protein (pI 5.7), a 29-kDa protein (pI 4.2), and a 20-kDa protein usually present in lower amounts. The 52- and 29-kDa proteins both reacted with a monoclonal antibody to S. mutans antigen A, a 29-kDa protein which has been characterized and used as a vaccine for the prevention of induced caries in rodents and monkeys. The 52-kDa protein, but not the 29-kDa protein, showed a capacity to bind to a broad number of carbohydrate polymers. The results from this study suggest that the recombinant 4B2 clone specifies a 52-kDa protein which is a precursor to the 29-kDa antigen A.
TI  - Plasmid vectors for constructing translational fusions to the B subunit of cholera toxin.
AB  - A family of plasmid cloning vectors has been developed for creating translational fusions to the ctxB gene encoding the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) in Escherichia coli. These vectors permit insertion of transcriptionally and translationally competent gene sequences upstream from ctxB. To test the utility of the system, a portion of the glucosyltransferase B (GTF) gene (gtfB) from the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans GS-5 (Bratthall serotype c), encoding the N-terminal one-third of the protein, was inserted into each vector. E. coli lysates containing the constructs were partially purified by passage over a GM1 ganglioside affinity column. Western blotting analysis of the column retentate from one of the lysates revealed the presence of a novel 58-kDa protein which cross-reacted with antisera to GTF and CTB. These vectors are of general use for making other translational fusions to ctxB. The high binding affinity of CTB can be exploited in purifying large polypeptides fused to this relatively small protein. Moreover, these vectors can be used to create neoantigens with altered immunogenicity for use in polypeptide-based vaccines.
TI  - IgA subclasses of human colostral antibodies specific for microbial and food antigens.
AB  - The distribution of total and antigen-specific IgA1 and IgA2 antibodies in human  colostrum was determined by ELISA using subclass-specific monoclonal reagents. In 18 samples of colostrum the mean ratio of total IgA1 to IgA2 was found to be 53:47, respectively, but significant individual variations were observed. In two samples we found unusually low levels of IgA1, while IgA2 was in the normal range. IgA1 and IgA2 antibody activities were determined against the following antigens: bovine gamma-globulin and beta-lactoglobulin, tetanus toxoid, protein antigen I/II of Streptococcus mutans, influenza virus vaccine, polysaccharides of pneumococcal, meningococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b origin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli K235. The IgA antibody activity directed against the polysaccharides was almost equally distributed between the two subclasses. However, antibody activity specific for protein antigens was found predominantly in the IgA1 subclass while anti-LPS activity was mostly of the IgA2 subclass.
TI  - Serum IgG antibodies reactive with lipoteichoic acid in adult patients with periodontitis.
AB  - IgG antibody levels to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), prepared from Streptococcus mutans cells, were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples from 149 subjects. An extract from Bacteroides gingivalis and lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 055:B5 served as control antigens. The reference group comprised 28 systemically and periodontally healthy adults. The main test groups were: 52 persons with gingivitis only, and 69 patients with periodontitis. Within those groups, 37 patients had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, another 20 patients were prospective or renal transplant recipients. The periodontitis patient group showed significantly (p less than 0.05) higher mean antibody value and higher frequency of extreme antibody responses to both LTA and B. gingivalis than the gingivitis group. LPS did not discriminate between the groups. Multiple regression analysis with gingivitis scores as the dependent variable selected plaque scores, anti-LTA antibody values and general health status as significant (p less than 0.05) regressors. The variance in radiographical alveolar bone loss was significantly (p less than 0.05) explained by age and by antibody values to B. gingivalis and to LTA. The patients with extreme immunological responsiveness to LTA or to B. gingivalis had about twice as much alveolar bone loss as those with normal serological reactivity. The results support the contention that LTA modulates the progression of periodontitis in humans.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of the Vibrio alginolyticus sucrase gene (scrB).
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.119-kb DNA fragment containing the Vibrio alginolyticus sucrase gene (scrB) was determined. The complete sequence (484 aa residues) of the sucrase was deduced and homology was detected between the sucrase enzymes from V. alginolyticus and the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus mutans. In Escherichia coli cells the cloned V. alginolyticus sucrase is translocated to the periplasm. Transposon phoA mutagenesis experiments strongly suggested that V. alginolyticus sucrase in E. coli is not exported across the cytoplasmic membrane by means of a typical signal sequence.
TI  - Molecular and immunochemical characterization of recombinant Escherichia coli containing the spaA gene region of Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - We identified and characterized a recombinant Escherichia coli containing the entire gene for surface protein antigen A (spaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715. The recombinant E. coli was isolated from a cosmid gene bank of size-fractionated S. sobrinus DNA fragments, and recombinants expressing the SpaA protein were detected immunologically. Subcloning experiments showed that the DNA sequences encoding the SpaA protein could be isolated on two contiguous EcoRI fragments, 3.7 and 3.3 kilobases (kb) in size, both contained on a 16.2-kb BglII fragment. Southern blot hybridization experiments using the EcoRI fragments to probe genomic DNAs from various serotypes of the mutans group of streptococci revealed DNA sequence homology not only to S. sobrinus 6715 (serotype g) chromosomal DNA but also to S. sobrinus serotype d DNA. Weak hybridization signals to Streptococcus mutans serotypes c, e, and f and to Streptococcus cricetus serotype a were observed with the 3.3-kb EcoRI fragment. These results suggest that the coding sequence for the spaA gene is probably conserved in S. sobrinus strains. Plasmid-encoded polypeptides made in E. coli minicells revealed that transcription of the spaA gene was initiated on the 3.7-kb EcoRI fragment and that its product size was about 210 kilodaltons. The cloned SpaA protein was purified from the periplasmic protein of E. coli, and monospecific antiserum against the cloned product was prepared in rabbits. The data obtained from various physiochemical and immunological procedures allowed us to conclude that the coding sequence for the entire spaA gene of S. sobrinus 6715 had been successfully cloned in E. coli and that faithful expression of the cloned product could be obtained.
TI  - Homology between surface protein antigen genes of Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The structural gene (pag gene) for a 210 kDa protein antigen of Streptococcus sobrinus serotype g was cloned and compared with that (pac gene) of a 190 kDa protein antigen of Streptococcus mutans serotype c. Immunodiffusion analysis revealed that the product of the pag gene immunologically cross-reacted with that of the pac gene. Southern blot and nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that a significant homology existed between the middle regions of the two structural genes.
TI  - Genetic and antigenic comparison of Streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase and glucan-binding protein.
AB  - The genes for fructosyltransferase (ftf) and glucan-binding protein (gbp) of Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt have been cloned in E. coli using bacteriophage and plasmid vectors. A single ftf gene appears to be responsible for the appearance of several FTF of different electrophoretic mobilities. Despite the fact that both ftf and gbp proteins synthesise fructans from sucrose in S. mutans and shown closely similar electrophoretic mobilities and isoelectric points, the restriction maps of the two genes are distinct, their DNAs do not hybridise and there is no immunological cross-reaction between the two proteins.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the expression product of the sr gene of Streptococcus mutans OMZ 175.
AB  - The subcloning in pBR322 of the gene of the S. mutans OMZ 175 74K SR protein, was performed after in vitro reconstitution, from two recombinant EMBL3 phages, lambda SmAD9 and lambda SmAD10. The gene is expressed in E. coli HB101 under the control of its own promoter and produces a protein with a molecular weight of 195 kDa. A strong immunological relationship between the expressed protein and the 74K SR protein was observed in ELISA, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. The 195 kDa protein was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. Its reactivity with monoclonal anti 74K SR antibodies indicates that it is probably a precursor form of the 74K SR protein produced in S. mutans. The adhesion properties of the two proteins, tested in solid phase adherence assays, are quite similar. This indicates that the additional peptide present in the precursor protein has little or no role in the adherence properties of protein 74K SR.
TI  - Cloning of a surface protein antigen gene from serotype c Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The structural gene for a 190 kD protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans MT8148 (serotype c) was cloned into the plasmid vector pUC118. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting showed that the Escherichia coli harbouring the chimaeric plasmid produced multiple polypeptides of 190-210 kD. Immunodiffusion analysis revealed that the cloned PAc had the same specific determinants as S. mutans PAc. The cloned pac gene was mapped, and its transcriptional orientation was determined by characterizing deletion mutants of the chimaeric plasmid. Southern blot analysis with the cloned gene sequence as a probe revealed the presence of a homologous sequence in DNAs from serotypes e and f S. mutans. PAc-defective mutants were constructed by inserting an erythromycin-resistance gene into the pac gene. The cell-surface hydrophobicity of the mutants was lower than that of the parent strain.
TI  - Cloning of the gene for cell-surface protein antigen A from Streptococcus sobrinus (serotype d).
AB  - A gene library of Strep. sobrinus B13N (serotype d) chromosomal DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli, with the bacteriophage vector lambda L47.1. A recombinant phage, lambda MDSM49, containing a 15.5 kb DNA insert, directed the expression of a 210 kDa antigenic protein. The recombinant 210 kDa protein was shown by Western blot analysis to be identical with cell-surface protein antigen A (spaA) from a serotype g strain. However, the restriction patterns of a subclone plasmid, pMD51, from lambda MDSM49 differed from those of serotype g strain. The cell-surface protein antigen I/II from serotype c Streptococcus mutans is a potential immunogen for vaccination against dental caries and corresponds to the spaA from serotype d and g strains. A recombinant clone, pDM51, will be a useful tool for serological and molecular biological studies. The recombinant spaA provides useful material for assessment of its diagnostic and immunogenic potential.
TI  - Characterization and sequence analysis of the scrA gene encoding enzyme IIScr of  the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans GS-5 scrA gene coding for enzyme IIScr of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system (PTS) was localized upstream from the scrB gene coding for sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase activity after Mu dE transposon mutagenesis of plasmid pMH613. The cloned scrA gene product was identified as a 68-kilodalton protein by minicell analysis after isolation of the gene in plasmid pD4. In addition, the membrane fraction from Escherichia coli cells containing pD4 exhibited sucrose PTS activity upon complementation with enzyme I and HPr from strain GS-5. The nucleotide sequence of the scrA region revealed that this gene was located immediately upstream from the scrB gene and divergently transcribed from the opposite DNA strand. The scrA gene was preceded by potential Shine-Dalgarno and promoterlike sequences and was followed by a transcription terminator-like sequence. The scrA gene coded for an enzyme IIScr protein of 664 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 69,983. This enzyme IIScr protein was larger than the comparable proteins from Bacillus subtilis and E. coli containing sucrose-metabolizing plasmid pUR400. The 491-amino-acid N-terminal sequence of the S. mutans enzyme IIScr was homologous with the B. subtilis and E. coli sequences, and the 173-amino-acid C-terminal sequence of the S. mutans protein was also homologous with the Salmonella typhimurium enzyme IIIGlc and the 162-amino-acid C terminus of E. coli enzyme IIBgl. These results suggest that the sucrose PTS system of S. mutans is enzyme III independent.
TI  - Tn916 insertional inactivation of multiple genes on the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans GS-5.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was transformed with the Escherichia coli plasmid pAM150 containing the cloned streptococcal transposon Tn916. Southern blot analyses with the tetracycline-resistant determinant of Tn916 showed that Tn916 was inserted into the chromosome of S. mutans at a variety of different sites. Tn916 insertions resulted in the inactivation of genes that code for various steps in the biosynthesis of several different amino acids. Two auxotrophs which contained a single copy of Tn916 were shown to revert to prototrophy at frequencies of about 10(-8). All of the revertant prototrophs were susceptible to tetracycline, indicating regeneration of the functional gene by excision of Tn916.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans gtfA gene specifies sucrose phosphorylase.
AB  - The ethanol-insoluble product formed from sucrose by purified enzyme encoded by the gtfA gene from Streptococcus mutans, expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli, was analyzed by 13C and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. The product was identified as alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate, and it was concluded that the GTF-A enzyme is sucrose phosphorylase (sucrose:orthophosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase [EC 2.4.1.7]).
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of a Streptococcus mutans major surface protein  antigen, P1 (I/II), in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Antigen P1, also called I/II, is one of the most abundant cell wall proteins of the mutans streptococci. It has been suggested that P1 may be involved in cell adherence to tooth surfaces and in sucrose-induced cell aggregation. As a first step toward fully understanding its biological functions, the P1 gene, which has been designated spaP1, from Streptococcus mutans NG5 (serotype c) has been cloned into Escherichia coli JM109 by a shotgun procedure with pUC18 as the vector. The recombinant strain expressing P1 carries a 5.2-kilobase DNA insert whose restriction map has been determined. This map is completely different from that of spaA of Streptococcus sobrinus (serotype g), even though P1 and SpaA are antigenically related. Southern hybridization revealed that DNA sequences closely homologous to spaP1 were present in serotypes c, e, and f, and similar sequences also existed in strains of serotypes a and d. The expression of the cloned spaP1 was found to be independent of the lac inducer and the orientation of the DNA insert, suggesting that it carries its own promoter. Western blotting (immunoblotting) revealed at least 20 bands reacting with a mixture of three anti-P1 monoclonal antibodies. The highest-molecular-weight reactive band was comparable in size to the parent P1 (185 kilodaltons [kDa]); however, the major reactive bands were smaller (approximately 160 kDa). Expression of cloned P1 in E. coli LC137 (htpR lonR9) resulted in the increased prominence of the 185-kDa protein reactive band. Ouchterlony immunodiffusion showed partial identity between the parent and cloned P1. In E. coli, P1 was detected primarily in the periplasm and extracellular fluid.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the Streptococcus mutans gtfC gene, coding for  synthesis of both soluble and insoluble glucans.
AB  - The intact gtfC gene from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was isolated in Escherichia coli in plasmid vector pUC18. The glucosyltransferase activity expressed by the gene synthesized both low-molecular-weight water-soluble glucan and insoluble glucan in a primer-independent manner. Purification of the enzyme by procedures that minimize proteolytic digestion yielded a purified preparation with a molecular weight of 140,000. Insertional inactivation of the gtfC gene with a streptococcal erythromycin resistance gene fragment followed by transformation of strain GS-5 suggested that the gtfC gene product was required for sucrose-dependent colonization in vitro. In addition, evidence for the presence of a third gtf gene coding for soluble glucan synthesis was obtained following the construction of mutants containing deletions of both the gtfB and gtfC genes.
TI  - Molecular basis for the spontaneous generation of colonization-defective mutants  of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Spontaneous mutants of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 defective in sucrose-dependent colonization of smooth surfaces are generated at frequencies above the spontaneous mutation rate. Southern blot analysis of such mutants suggested rearrangement of the genes coding for glucosyltransferase (GTF) activity. Two strain GS-5 homologous tandem genes, gtfB and gtfC, coding for GTF-I and GTF-S activities respectively, were demonstrated to undergo recombination when introduced into recombination-proficient Escherichia coli transformants. However, the two genes were quite stable when transformed on a single DNA fragment into a recA mutant of E. coli. The DNA fragment coding for GTF activity from one S. mutans colonization-defective mutant, SP2, was isolated and shown also to have undergone recombination between the gtfB and gtfC genes, resulting in reduced GTF activity. These results are discussed relative to the in vivo generation of colonization-defective mutants in cultures of S. mutans.
TI  - Cloning of the saliva-interacting protein gene from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Genomic libraries from Streptococcus mutans OMZ175 were constructed in bacteriophage vectors. DNA fragments 1 to 2 kilobases in length were cloned in expression vector lambda gt11. S. mutans DNA fragments 15 to 20 kilobases in length were inserted in the BamHI site of phage EMBL3. Rabbit antiserum raised against an S. mutans saliva-interacting protein with a molecular weight of 74,000, designated 74K SR, was used to screen the lambda gt11 library. A recombinant phage carrying an S. mutans DNA sequence of 1.45 kilobases, lambda SmAD2, was detected and isolated. This fragment, named SmAD2, was used to construct the recombinant expression plasmid pSAD2-4 which encoded for the expression of a 60,000-molecular-weight protein controlled by the beta-galactosidase promoter from plasmid pUC8. The SmAD2 fragment and polyclonal anti-74K SR antibodies were used to screen the EMBL3 library. A total coincidence between the screening with antibodies and the DNA probe was observed, and two phages, lambda SmAD9 and lambda SmAD10, were isolated. They contained a common S. mutans DNA sequence of about 11.8 kilobases and coded for a protein with a molecular weight of about 195,000, which comigrated with a protein of an S. mutans cell wall extract. The expressed protein was purified, and a very strong relationship with the S. mutans 74K SR protein was found by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Thus, cloning of the 74K SR gene allowed us to demonstrate that the saliva receptor appears to be a part of an S. mutans precursor molecule with a molecular mass of 195,000 daltons.
TI  - Expression, purification, and characterization of an exo-beta-D-fructosidase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A genetic library of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, constructed in an Escherichia coli plasmid vector, was screened for cells which could utilize sucrose as the sole carbon and energy source. The recombinant plasmid pFRU1, containing a 4.2-kilobase pair insert of S. mutans DNA, was shown to confer this phenotype. Further characterization of the gene product encoded by pFRU1 revealed that the enzyme was a beta-D-fructosidase with the highest specificity for the beta (2----6)-linked fructan polymer levan. The enzyme could also hydrolyze inulin [beta (2----1)-linked fructan], sucrose, and raffinose with 34, 21, and 12%, respectively, of the activity observed for levan. The gene (designated fruA) appeared to be expressed under its own control in E. coli, as judged by the lack of influence on gene product activity of induction or repression of the beta-galactosidase promoter adjacent to the insertion site on the cloning vector. The protein was purified to homogeneity, as judged by silver staining of purified protein in denaturing and reducing conditions in polyacrylamide gels, from sonic lysate of E. coli, as well as from culture supernatants of S. mutans GS-5 grown in a chemostat at low dilution rate with fructose as the sole carbohydrate source. Both purified proteins had an apparent molecular mass of 140,000 daltons in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were immunologically related and comigrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as determined by Western blotting with antisera raised against the cloned gene product, and were identical in all physical and biochemical properties tested. The pH optimum of the enzyme acting on fructan polymers was 5.5, with a significant amount of activity remaining at pH 4.0. The optimum pH for sucrose degradation was broader and lower, with a peak at approximately 4.5. Enzyme activity was inhibited almost completely by Hg2+ and Ag2+, inhibited partially by Cu2+, not inhibited by fluoride ion or Tris, and slightly stimulated by Mn2+ and Co2+. Fructan polymers were attacked exohydrolytically by the enzyme, fructose being the only product released. With sufficient time, both levan and inulin were degraded to completion, with no evidence of product inhibition.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of Streptococcus mutans LM7 plasmid pAM7.
AB  - The 5.6-kilobase-pair cryptic plasmid, pAM7, of Streptococcus mutans LM7 was cloned into Escherichia coli plasmids or a shuttle plasmid to examine whether the plasmid encodes bacteriocin. Plasmid pAM7 encoded proteins with molecular weights of 30,000, 22,000, and 12,000, but none of them appeared to be bacteriocin.
TI  - The phospholipid components of bacteria related to periodontitis.
AB  
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the glucosyltransferase C gene (gtfC) from Streptococcus mutans LM7.
AB  - A glucosyltransferase (GTF) gene, designated gtfC, was cloned from Streptococcus  mutans LM7. Its gene product was detected by screening a bacteriophage lambda library with rabbit antiserum raised against S. mutans LM7 extracellular proteins. DNA isolated from the immunopositive recombinant phage revealed two S. mutans chromosomal EcoRI fragment inserts, 8.1 and 4.7 kilobase pairs in size. Escherichia coli minicell analyses revealed the approximate position and direction of transcription of the gtfC gene. The gene product was determined to be a polypeptide of about 150 kilodaltons which synthesized a water-soluble glucan. Restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA hybridization indicated a repeated region of DNA corresponding to a portion of the coding region of gtfC immediately downstream from the intact gtfC locus on the chromosome. A 300-base-pair gtfC-specific probe showed that the gene and the putative duplicated sequence were present in S. mutans serotypes c, e, and f, but not in other related oral streptococci which had GTF activity. In addition, the gtfC determinant displayed homology to sequences corresponding to the carboxy-terminal coding region of a gene (gtfB) encoding a GTF activity that synthesized water-insoluble glucans. These data suggest that at least one class of GTF genes may be present in multiple copies in S. mutans and, further, that GTF genes may contain conserved sequences internal to their coding regions.
TI  - Utilization of a mini-mu transposon to construct defined mutants in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The gtfB gene coding for glucosyltransferase-I (GTF-I) activity previously isolated from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was insertionally inactivated with the newly constructed transposon MudE in an Escherichia coli background. Insertion of MudE into various regions of the gtfB gene led to inactivation of GTF-I activity. The altered gene was introduced back into S. mutans GS-5 by transformation and produced mutants defective in insoluble glucan synthesis as well as the ability to colonize smooth surfaces in the presence of sucrose. Therefore, the MudE transposon can be utilized to produce specific mutants in oral streptococci as well as in other transformable Gram-positive bacteria expressing an erythromycin-resistance marker.
TI  - Deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a Salmonella plasmid cloned in  Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - The sucrose operon from pUR400, a 78-kbp conjugative Salmonella plasmid, was cloned in Escherichia coli K12. The operon was located in a 5.7-kbp SalI restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector pUC18. The insert DNA was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. Additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease Bal31. Cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. The scrA (enzyme IIScr) and scrR (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp SmaI-SalI DNA fragment and were assigned the order scrB, scrA, scrR. An amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, Mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. This protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 M sodium chloride, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The protein did not appear to be the product of either the scrA, scrB, or scrR gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. A new gene, scrC, is proposed. In addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp SalI and 2.5-kbp SmaI-SalI DNA fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to DNA from a sucrose plasmid from Salmonella tennessee. However, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of a Streptococcus sanguis DNase necessary for repair of DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate.
AB  - We developed a method for cloning cellular nucleases from streptococci. Recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophage containing streptococcal nuclease determinants were identified by the production of pink plaques on toluidine blue O DNase plates. We used this technique to clone a 3.2-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment with DNase activity from the chromosome of Streptococcus sanguis. The locus was designated don (DNase one) and could be subcloned and stably maintained on plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli. Minicell analyses of various subclones of the don locus allowed us to determine the coding region and size of the Don nuclease in E. coli. The don gene product had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kilodaltons and degraded native DNA most efficiently, with lesser activity against denatured DNA and no detectable activity against RNA. S. sanguis don deletion mutants were constructed by transformation of competent cells with in vitro-prepared plasmid constructs. S. sanguis don deletion mutants retained normal transformation frequencies for exogenously added donor DNA. However, when compared with Don+ wild-type cells, these mutants were hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by UV light and methyl methanesulfonate. An S. sanguis don-specific DNA probe detected homology to chromosomal DNA isolated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans Bratthall serogroups d and g. Our results suggested that the don locus was the S. sanguis allele of the previously described S. pneumoniae major exonuclease and was involved in repair of DNA damage. Furthermore, hybridization studies suggested that the don locus was conserved among species of oral streptococci.
TI  - Membrane-associated and solubilized ATPases of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The proton-translocating, membrane ATPases of oral streptococci have been implicated in cytoplasmic pH regulation, acidurance, and cariogenicity. Membranes were isolated from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 following salt-induced lysis of cells treated with lysozyme and mutanolysin. The ATPase activities of these membranes were 1.8 and 1.1 units per mg membrane protein, respectively. F1 ATPases were washed free from the membranes and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Hydrolytic activities of the F1 ATPases were maximal at pH values between 6.0 and 6.6, whereas the membrane-bound enzymes had pH maxima of 7.5 (S. sanguis) and 6.0 (S. mutans). The F1 ATPases of the streptococci were similar to the well-characterized enzyme of Escherichia coli; they consisted of five different polypeptides and had apparent, aggregate molecular weights of from 335 to 350 Kd. The membrane-bound ATPases were characterized biochemically and found to be similar to those of proton-translocating ATPases of E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. Km values for the membranes with respect to ATP were found to be 0.9 and 1.0 mmol/L for S. mutans and S. sanguis, respectively. Both enzymes had specificities for purine triphosphates and were active with a variety of divalent cations, although optimal activity occurred with ATP and Mg. The membrane-associated enzymes were sensitive to the inhibitors dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and azide, but insensitive to ouabain and vanadate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Characterization of glucosyltransferase expressed from a Streptococcus sobrinus gene cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding a glucosyltransferase which synthesized water-insoluble glucan, gtfI, previously cloned from Streptococcus sobrinus strain MFe28 (mutans serotype h) into a bacteriophage lambda vector, was subcloned into the plasmid pBR322. The recombinant plasmid was stable in Escherichia coli and gtfI was efficiently expressed. The GTF-I expressed in E. coli was compared to the corresponding enzymes in S. sobrinus strains MFe28 (serotype h), B13 (serotype d) and 6715 (serotype g) and shown to resemble them closely in molecular mass and isoelectric point. The insoluble glucan produced by GTF-I from recombinant E. coli consisted of 1,3-alpha-D-glycosyl residues (approximately 90%). An internal fragment of the gtfI gene was used as a probe in hybridization experiments to demonstrate the presence of homologous sequences in chromosomal DNA of other streptococci of the mutans group.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the asd gene of Streptococcus mutans. Identification of the promoter region and evidence for attenuator-like sequences preceding the structural gene.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the asd gene of Streptococcus mutans encoding aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.11), an enzyme comprised of 357 amino acids, having an Mr of 38,897 and active in the biosynthetic pathway of lysine, threonine, methionine, diaminopimelic acid, and isoleucine, has been determined. In addition we report the 276 nucleotides upstream of the structural gene which contain a highly efficient promoter identified by both RNA polymerase binding and in vitro transcription analysis. A leader transcript which terminates at a fixed point immediately preceding the asd promoter region was identified in the DNA sequence and confirmed by in vitro transcription analysis as well. The close proximity of this transcript and its p-independent transcriptional terminator to the asd coding sequence suggests involvement in a mechanism of regulation. Message stability experiments indicate the half-life of asd specific messages to be comparable to that of Escherichia coli messages. Conditions of varying concentrations of lysine, threonine, and methionine exert no apparent control over expression of the S. mutans asd gene in Escherichia coli suggesting the requirement of an accessory regulatory element specific for the S. mutans asd gene.
TI  - A comparison of IgA in portal and peripheral venous blood.
AB  - A comparison of IgA in portal and peripheral venous blood was made to elucidate further any possible role of the liver in IgA functions in man. Over fifty paired samples of portal and peripheral blood were obtained from patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The samples were examined for total IgA and secretory IgA content, IgA immune complexes, and the proportion of polymeric IgA and IgA antibodies to Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli. No significant differences in the overall IgA concentration in portal and peripheral venous blood were found, but the concentration of secretory IgA was raised in portal blood (P less than 0.02). The IgA content of immune complexes (PEG precipitates) was significantly raised in portal sera compared with peripheral sera. Antibody levels to S. mutans or E. coli were not significantly different in the paired samples. A mean of 18.1% of the IgA in portal blood was greater than 7S in size compared with a mean of 15.3% in peripheral blood (P less than 0.01). Detectable differences between IgA in portal and peripheral venous blood could indicate some role of the liver in the transport of polymeric IgA and IgA complexes from serum to bile in man, but could represent increased production of these types of IgA in tissues drained by the portal vein.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of 2 aliphatic amines and chlorhexidine in vitro and in  saliva.
AB  - The surfactants tetradecylamine, hexadecylamine and chlorhexidine have been compared with regard to their ability to inhibit microbial growth. Antibacterial activity was assessed by tube dilution methods. Tetradecylamine and chlorhexidine were similar in antibacterial activity, being effective at low concentrations against most organisms tested. Hexadecylamine also inhibited growth but at higher concentrations. Viable counts of salivary organisms were monitored in volunteers over 48 h after one rinse with the agents. The initial reduction in numbers of total viable salivary bacteria and streptococci by tetradecylamine and of streptococci by hexadecylamine had disappeared 3 h after a single mouth rinse, but the reduction in numbers of all salivary bacteria by chlorhexidine was more prolonged.
TI  - Infection with the bacterium Streptococcus mutans and salivary IgA antibodies in  mothers and their children.
AB  - Salivary IgA-antibody titres against different streptococcal antigens were measured in 64 mothers and their first-born children. Their presence and the level of Streptococcus mutans had been monitored for several years. The children had carried this bacterium for various lengths of time and now had varying numbers of salivary Strep. mutans. The subjects had participated in a longitudinal study completed one and a half years before, concerning prevention of early colonization of the child's mouth by Strep. mutans through measures undertaken by the mother. Whole-saliva samples were collected from all subjects and analysed by ELISA techniques for total IgA, and for IgA antibodies to whole cells of Strep. mutans serotype c and d, whole cells of Strep. sanguis, purified polysaccharide and protein antigens of Strep. mutans serotype c and d; a pool of Escherichia coli antigens was used as a control. No significant differences were found in the level of any of the specific IgA antibodies in children with different levels of indigenous Strep. mutans. A tendency to higher IgA antibody activity was found in children who had levels of Strep. mutans first detectable after three years of age and who had carried the bacterium for six months or less. The IgA antibody activity to Strep. mutans specific serotype c antigen and to whole cells of Strep. mutans serotype c (JC 2) was significantly higher in children with no caries experience when compared to children with more than two df-surfaces. This study offers no clear evidence for a protective role of salivary IgA antibodies against Strep. mutans colonization.
TI  - The relationship between IgA antibodies to Streptococcus mutans antigens in human saliva and breast milk and the numbers of indigenous oral Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The influence of indigenous Streptococcus mutans on naturally-occurring levels of IgA antibodies was studied in 42 lactating females. Breast milk, parotid and whole-saliva samples were collected and analysed by the ELISA method for IgA antibodies, reacting with antigens from Strep. mutans. All salivas and breast milk showed IgA antibody activity to five antigenic preparations from Strep. mutans and to a pool of Escherichia coli antigens. No correlation was observed between the IgA antibody level in breast milk and that in saliva. The total IgA in breast milk was, however, considerably higher than in the salivas. In subjects with active caries and subjects with high DMFS scores, there was a tendency toward lower levels of IgA antibodies in whole saliva than in subjects with low caries experience. The levels of specific IgA antibodies in saliva did not reflect the amount of indigenous Strep. mutans present in the mouth at the time of sampling.

TI  - Tight genetic linkage of a glucosyltransferase and dextranase of Streptococcus mutans GS-5.
AB  - A genetic library consisting of over 5000 clones with an average insert size of 6.9 kilobasepairs (kbp) of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 has been constructed in a bivalent plasmid vector pMK3, which is capable of replicating in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The recombinant plasmid pSUCRI, containing a 6.0 kbp fragment of S. mutans GS-5 DNA, was the focus of this study. Using Southern hybridization, in vitro and in vivo gene expression techniques, and biochemical analysis, this clone was shown to encode the 55 kiloDalton (kDal) GS-5 gtfA gene product, as well as a 38 and a 66 kDal polypeptide. In addition to the gtfA gene, pSUCRI encodes a dextranase activity with specificity for alpha(1----6)-linked glucans, and with no detectable activity on mutan. The dextranase enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 66 kDal as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins produced by a dextranase-negative deletion derivative. The pH optimum of the enzyme was approximately 6.0, and there was no detectable activity below pH 5.0. By subcloning various combinations of DNA fragments from pSUCRI, it was demonstrated that the dextranase gene (designated dexB) can be separated from the gtfA gene and still be efficiently expressed in both E. coli and B. subtilis. The dexB gene contained its own promoter and ribosome-binding site. The genetic linkage of the gtfA and dexB genes in the S. mutans GS-5 chromosome was confirmed by Southern hybridization and by the independent isolation of four distinct clones containing the gtfA gene and common flanking sequences. In addition to a glucosyltransferase and dextranase, an invertase-like activity is also encoded on pSUCRI, indicating that there is a cluster of genes on the S. mutans GS-5 chromosome which is devoted to the dissimilation of sucrose and concomitant synthesis or modification of glucans into a water-insoluble form, perhaps constituting an operon for glucan modification which can be coordinately regulated in response to environmental alterations.
TI  - Transformation of Streptococcus mutans with chromosomal and shuttle plasmid (pYA629) DNAs.
AB  - Transformation (i.e., DNase-sensitive genetic transfer) of strains of Streptococcus mutans representing serotypes c and e was accomplished by using chromosomal DNA from a Rifr Strr Spcr isolate of strain GS5 (UAB525) and a chimeric plasmid, pYA629. Shuttle plasmid pYA629 comprises the S. mutans plasmid pVA318, an inducible erythromycin resistance determinant originally isolated from a group A streptococcal strain, the tetracycline resistance gene and replication region of the Escherichia coli plasmid pBR322, and the promoter region of the S. mutans gene for aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. The strains examined for recipient ability included those known to lack a cryptic plasmid (GS5, UA130, UA159, and MT8148) and those known to contain a widely disseminated 5.8-kilobase cryptic plasmid (LM7, V318, UA101, UA174, and 3098791). The transformation frequencies in GS5 for GS5 chromosomal antibiotic resistance markers were comparable to those reported by others, but UA101, UA130, UA159 and UA174 were transformed with both chromosomal and plasmid markers at much higher efficiencies. In a larger strain survey, strains containing the 5.8-kilobase cryptic plasmid were more frequently transformable with both chromosomal and pYA629 DNAs than were strains lacking this cryptic plasmid. All plasmid-containing strains except LM7 lost their resident cryptic plasmids when transformed with pYA629. LM7 transformed with pYA629 retained pLM7. There are therefore at least two incompatibility groups among S. mutans cryptic plasmids. yPA629 DNA isolated from either E. coli or S. mutans transformed S. mutans with equal efficiency. pYA629 DNA isolated from S. mutans transformed both restriction-deficient and restriction-proficient E. coli recipients. Therefore, the strains of S. mutans used lack a restriction-modification system for pYA629 DNA sequences. S. mutans strains that are readily transformable, display maximal cariogenicity in gnotobiotic rats, and give high scores for in vitro measures of important virulence attributes have been identified to facilitate studies on the genetic basis and control of virulence.
TI  - Molecular organization and expression of the gtfA gene of Streptococcus mutans LM7.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans LM7 gene gtfA was cloned in Escherichia coli along with  flanking regions of the chromosome as a fragment representing 10.3 kilobases (kb) of streptococcal DNA. Restriction endonuclease mapping revealed that the cloned DNA consisted of four EcoRI fragments with gtfA sucrase activity localized to one fragment, EcoRI-B (2.4 kb). Subsequent analysis with E. coli minicells indicated that three polypeptides were encoded on the 10.3-kb insert (55 [GtfA], 45, and 35 kilodaltons). Neither the 45- nor 35-kilodalton polypeptide exhibited any detectable sucrase activity. The approximate positions and directions of transcription of the two larger proteins were determined from minicell protein profiles displaying truncated versions of these polypeptides. The restriction endonuclease data for the cloned gtfA gene were used to develop a strategy for insertional inactivation of this locus in vivo. An internal HincII fragment of the gtfA gene was removed and replaced with a DNA fragment containing a tetracycline resistance determinant. This new recombinant plasmid was linearized and then transformed into S. mutans GS5 and S. mutans V403 where it was incapable of replication. It was predicted that Tcr colonies would result from double-crossover recombinational events involving homologous regions flanking the gtfA gene. This was verified by Southern DNA hybridization analyses. The inactivation of the gtfA gene in both S. mutans GS5 and S. mutans V403 resulted in a decrease of water-soluble exopolysaccharide but no detectable changes in the amounts of water-insoluble polymers.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  patients with cirrhosis.
AB  - To determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females) with 16 Gram-negative infective episodes (12 Escherichia coli and 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. Ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. All organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). Serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). Ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). Although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. Three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; Streptococcus faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to Streptococcus equinus and Streptococcus mutans in the other two. Aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. Serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. A negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. The high mortality rate was attributable to the generally poor underlying condition of the patients.
TI  - Molecular and genetic characterization of lactose-metabolic genes of Streptococcus cremoris.
AB  - Lac+ plasmid DNA from Streptococcus cremoris H2 was subcloned with an Escherichia coli vector on a 3.5-kilobase-pair PstI-AvaI fragment. Genetic analysis of the cloned DNA was possible because linear Lac+ DNA fragments were productive in the S. sanguis transformation system. Complementation of S. sanguis Lac-mutants showed that the 3.5-kilobase-pair fragment included the structural gene for 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosidase and either enzyme II-lac or factor III-lac of the lactose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Expression of the S. cremoris-like 40,000-dalton 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosidase in S. sanguis Lac+ transformants, rather than the 52,000-dalton wild-type S. sanguis enzyme, demonstrated the occurrence of gene replacement and not gene repair. The evidence supports chromosomal integration as the mechanism by which S. sanguis Lac- recipients are converted to a Lac+ phenotype after transformation with Lac+ DNA. Southern blot data suggest that the Lac+ DNA does not reside on a transposon, but that integration always occurs within a specific HincII fragment of the recipient chromosome. Hybridization experiments demonstrate homology between the S. cremoris Lac+ DNA and cellular DNA from Lac+ strains of Streptococcus lactis, S. mutans, S. faecalis, and S. sanguis.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Cloning of a Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase gene coding for insoluble glucan synthesis.
AB  - The gtfB gene coding for a glucosyltransferase (GTF) activity of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was isolated on a 15.4-kilobase DNA fragment by using a lambda L47.1 gene library. The activity was catalyzed by gene products of 150 and 145 kilodaltons which reacted with antibodies directed against both soluble and insoluble glucan-synthesizing GTFs. The enzyme present in crude Escherichia coli extracts synthesized both soluble and insoluble glucans. The enzyme was partially purified from lysates of the lambda DS-76 clone and synthesized both types of glucans in a primer-independent fashion. In addition, the purified enzyme exhibited a pI of approximately 5.0. Southern blot analysis indicated that the cloned GTF gene represented a contiguous nucleotide sequence on the strain GS-5 chromosome. Furthermore, evidence for the existence of a distinct gene sharing partial homology with gtfB was also obtained. The gtfB gene was subcloned into plasmid pACYC184 into E. coli and exhibited GTF activity when carried on GS-5 inserts as small as 5 kilobases. The approximate location of the GTF promoter and the direction of gene transcription were also determined. The cloned enzyme was not secreted through the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli, since most of the activity was found in the cytoplasm and, in lesser amounts, associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. The gtfB gene was insertionally inactivated by introducing a gene fragment coding for erythromycin resistance into the GTF coding region. After transformation of strain GS-5 with the altered gene, transformants defective in insoluble glucan synthesis were identified. These results indicate that the gtfB gene codes for a GTF involved in insoluble glucan synthesis in strain GS-5.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase gene from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The Streptococcus mutans GS-5 gene, scrB, coding for sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase activity has been cloned into Escherichia coli utilizing the bacteriophage replacement vector lambda L47.1. DNA sequences containing the gene were initially subcloned into the moderate-copy-number plasmid vector pLG339 to yield active subclones. However, due to the instability of the resultant chimeric plasmids, the gene was subsequently subcloned into the low-copy-number vector pOU61 to yield the stable hybrid plasmid pMH613. Both plasmids contain a 6.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment from strain GS-5 and express both hydrolase and sucrase activities. The relative position of the gene in the insert has been determined after Tn5 mutagenesis and deletion analysis. The cloned enzyme was purified to near homogeneity after gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme displayed a molecular mass of 58 kilodaltons, which is significantly higher than the 48-kilodalton enzyme previously purified from S. mutans GS-5. These results suggest that processing of the hydrolase occurs in S. mutans.

AB  
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of scrB, the structural gene for the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  - A DNA fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the Streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain GS5. The locus, designated scrB, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pVA1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). Minicell analysis of pVA1343-directed translation products revealed that the scrB product synthesized in Escherichia coli V1343 was a single peptide of Mr 57,000. This polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against S. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an Mr of 43,000 to 48,000. The basis of this difference in Mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in S. mutans but not in recombinant V1343. Sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from V1343 exhibited Michaelis constants of 180 mM for sucrose and 0.08 mM for sucrose-6-phosphate. Deletion analysis of pVA1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for the transcription of scrB. scrB-defective strains of S. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrB locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. Similar loci were detected by DNA-DNA hybridization in additional strains of S. mutans and two strains of Streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of S. rattus, S. sobrinus, S. sanguis I and II, S. salivarius, or S. mitis.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a fructosyltransferase gene from Streptococcus  mutans GS-5.
AB  - A fructosyltransferase (FTF) gene from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 has been isolated from a lambda L47.1 clone bank. The gene was contained on an 11.7-kilobase GS-5 DNA fragment and was initially subcloned into plasmid pACYC184 as a 5.4-kilobase HindIII fragment. However, further analysis revealed that transcription of the FTF gene was initiated at the P1 promoter contained on the vector. It was possible to subclone the FTF gene with its presumed promoter as a 3.4-kilobase EcoRI fragment to produce the chimeric plasmid pSS22 expressing FTF activity. The cloned enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity after ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and DEAE-Bio-Gel-A chromatography followed by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme displayed a lower molecular weight (63,000) compared with the multiple activities detected in the culture fluids of strain GS-5. In addition, storage of the purified enzyme resulted in the formation of even lower-molecular-weight enzymatically active species. These results suggested that proteolytic degradation of the FTF occurs both in S. mutans and in Escherichia coli. In addition, a comparison of the properties of the cloned enzyme with those previously characterized from another serotype c S. mutans strain suggests that multiple FTF genes may be present in these organisms.
TI  - In vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmid molecules for analyses of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterial genomic libraries.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli K-12 were constructed that permitted the amplification of in vitro-packaged recombinant cosmid-transducing particles by in vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmid molecules. Thermal induction of these thermoinducible, excision-defective lysogens containing recombinant cosmid molecules yielded high titers of packaged recombinant cosmids and low levels of PFU. These strains were used to amplify packaged recombinant cosmid libraries of Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium vaccae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Streptococcus mutans DNA. Contiguous and noncontiguous libraries were compared for the successful identification of cloned genes. Construction of noncontiguous libraries allowed the dissociation of desired genes from genes that were deleterious to the survival of a cosmid recombinant and permitted selection for unlinked traits that resulted in a selected phenotype. In vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmids permitted amplification of the original in vitro-packaged collection of transducing particles, storage of cosmid libraries as phage lysates, facilitation of complementation screening, expression analysis of repackaged recombinant cosmids after UV-irradiated cells were infected, in situ enzyme or immunological screening, and facilitation of recovery of recombinant cosmid molecules containing transposon inserts.
TI  - Expression of Mycobacterium leprae genes from a Streptococcus mutans promoter in  Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Genomic libraries of Mycobacterium leprae DNA partially digested with Pst I were  constructed in the expression vector pYA626, which contains the promoter region from the Streptococcus mutans gene encoding aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is very efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. We have detected several clones that complement a mutation in the citrate synthase gene of E. coli. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the complementing DNA was M. leprae DNA. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel analysis of polypeptides produced by minicells containing the citrate synthase-complementing recombinant molecules demonstrated the production of a 46-kDa polypeptide. When the citrate synthase-complementing fragment was cloned in pYA626 in the reverse orientation, the recombinant molecule was no longer able to complement the mutation in the citrate synthase gene and no longer produced the 46-kDa polypeptide. When the DNA fragment was cloned in the Pst I site of pHC79, so as to allow expression from the beta-lactamase promoter, the resulting recombinant failed to complement the mutation in the E. coli citrate synthase gene yet still produced the 46-kDa polypeptide, but in one-fourth the amount than when expressed from the S. mutans asd promoters. This demonstrates that M. leprae translational sequences can be recognized by E. coli translational machinery. Promoter expression vectors can be used to obtain expression of protein antigens to be used for early diagnosis of leprosy or components of a vaccine and proteins that are targets of potential antileprosy drugs.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Salivary immunoglobulin A and serum antibodies to Streptococcus mutans ribosomal  preparations in dental caries-free and caries-susceptible human subjects.
AB  - Caries-free subjects or individuals with low caries susceptibility exhibited significantly higher (P less than 0.001) levels of naturally occurring salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to a Streptococcus mutans ribosomal preparation than subjects with high caries susceptibility. Absorption of saliva and serum samples with S. mutans ribosomal preparations, but not with other S. mutans antigens or with Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ribosomal preparations, removed the antibody activity. Absorption with Streptococcus sanguis ribosomes and NH4Cl-washed S. mutans ribosomes partially removed the anti-S. mutans ribosome antibody activity. These results provide evidence that naturally occurring salivary and serum antibodies to the S. mutans ribosomal preparation correlate with susceptibility to dental caries.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase gene in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The gtfA gene of Streptococcus mutans GS-5, which encodes a 55-kDa glucosyltransferase has been isolated from a genetic library in an Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector, pMK3. The construction containing the gene enables E. coli JM83 and a sucrase-deficient mutant of B. subtilis to grow on sucrose as the sole carbohydrate source. The gene is expressed under its own control in both organisms. The level of biochemical activity detectable in B. subtilis carrying the clone is approx. 50% of that found in E. coli harboring the same construction. In Bacillus, the gene is expressed through exponential and stationary phases of growth with a decrease in activity as the culture enters stationary phase, corresponding to increases in intracellular protease levels. The enzyme produced in E. coli or B. subtilis harboring the cloned gene is identical to the enzyme produced by S. mutans GS-5 as determined by migration in native polyacrylamide gels.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of Streptococcus mutans: purification of HPr and enzyme I and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Enzyme I and HPr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. To determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in Streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme I and HPr from S. mutans ATCC 27352. Using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme I and HPr in cells of S. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of S. mutans. HPr was purified by the procedure reported by Gauthier et al. (L. Gauthier, D. Mayrand, and C. Vadeboncoeur, J. Bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. Enzyme I was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-Streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. The protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. The subunit molecular weight of enzyme I determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. In gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees C, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme I is a dimer. In double immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against HPr reacted with several oral streptococci, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus casei, but not with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Antibodies against enzyme I of S. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme I from all the other oral streptococci tested. No cross-reaction was observed with other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The levels of enzyme I and HPr determined by rocket electrophoresis in S. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. Glucose-grown cells of other S. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme I and HPr which were similar to those found in S. mutans 27352.
TI  - Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 and Escherichia coli K-12 strain 37 were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In cell extracts of both strains, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate, coenzyme A, and NAD was shown. The enzyme was induced by pyruvate in the growth medium, and there was higher activity in aerobically grown cells than in anaerobically grown cells. Acetyl phosphate was a potent inhibitor of the activity. This inhibition was partly overcome by inorganic phosphate.
TI  - Cloning and expression of two Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA from Streptococcus mutans strain MFe28 (serotype h) was cloned in the bacteriophage vector lambda L47.1. Two classes of recombinants were found which expressed glucosyltransferase activity in phage plaques: (i) gtfS, which expressed a glucosyltransferase synthesizing a water-soluble, dextranase-sensitive glucan, and (ii) gtfI, which expressed a primer-dependent glucosyltransferase synthesizing an insoluble glucan.
TI  - Immunoglobulin A subclass distribution of naturally occurring salivary antibodies to microbial antigens.
AB  - The distribution of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) and IgA2 antibodies to various microbial antigens was determined in human parotid saliva by using monoclonal antibodies to the IgA subclasses in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. In 12 subjects examined, antibodies to Streptococcus mutans glucosyl transferase, protein antigen I/II, and cell wall carbohydrate, as well as dextrans B1355 fraction S and B512 and phosphorylcholine, occurred predominantly in the IgA1 subclass. In contrast, antibodies to lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes and whole lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli were predominantly of the IgA2 subclass. The data indicate that in most individuals naturally occurring antibodies to a given antigen are predominantly associated with one of the two subclasses of IgA.
TI  - Cloned gtfA gene of Streptococcus mutans LM7 alters glucan synthesis in Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans LM7 (Bratthall serotype e) chromosomal DNA was partially digested with EcoRI and ligated into the positive-selection plasmid vector pOP203(A2+). The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli, and transformants were selected for tetracycline resistance. Recombinant-bearing clones were screened for their ability to ferment raffinose, using the procedure of Robeson et al. (J. Bacteriol. 153:211-221, 1983). One raffinose-fermenting clone was isolated and found to contain a plasmid with an insert consisting of four EcoRI fragments totalling approximately 10.3 kilobases (kb). This strain was capable of growth on defined medium plus raffinose or sucrose and generated reducing sugars from a sucrose substrate. Southern hybridization analysis of the four EcoRI fragments revealed homology not only to S. mutans LM7 chromosomal DNA but also to S. mutans serotypes b, c, and f. Subcloning of this fragment array into a streptococcal E. coli shuttle vector indicated that a 2.4-kb EcoRI fragment was essential for sucrase activity. E. coli minicell experiments revealed a gene product of 55 kilodaltons. These data along with restriction endonuclease analysis and Southern hybridizations suggested that the cloned S. mutans LM7 gene was closely related to the gtfA gene cloned by Robeson et al. from S. mutans PS13 (Bratthall serotype c). The shuttle plasmid containing the 2.4-kb fragment was transformed into Streptococcus sanguis, which subsequently displayed increased sucrase activity in both intracellular and extracellular fractions. Elevated levels of synthesis of alcohol-insoluble and water-insoluble glucans were observed with crude extracellular fractions of the S. sanguis strain bearing the 2.4-kb fragment. An isolate cured of the shuttle plasmid plus the 2.4-kb fragment displayed wild-type S. sanguis glucan synthesis. In S. sanguis, this gtfA allele may play a role in glucan synthesis by interacting with extant high-molecular-weight glucosyltransferases.
TI  - Chemical properties and immunobiological activities of streptococcal lipoteichoic acids.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) were chromatographically purified from crude phenol-water extract of whole cells of some streptococcal species, which included Streptococcus pyogenes Sv, Streptococcus mutans 6715, and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Among these, special attention was paid to S. pyogenes LTA for analyses of chemical composition and biological activities. All LTA preparations contained equimolar amounts of glycerol and phosphorus. Chemical analyses showed that S. pyogenes LTA contained glycerophosphate, alanine, glucose, and fatty acids (as palmitic acid) at molar ratio of 1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.25. The crude phenol-water extract and isolated LTA from S. pyogenes Sv were found to be mitogenic for spleen cells of BALB/c and BALB/c (nu/nu) mice, but not for thymus cells of BALB/c mice. The mitogenicity of deacylated LTA (dLTA) was significantly lower than that of LTA. It was also found that various LTA preparations possessed polyclonal B cell activation ability and adjuvant activity both in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by using hemolytic plaque assay. LTA, but not dLTA, induced macrophage activation which resulted in tumor cytotoxicity in mice. Limulus lysate activity of S. pyogenes LTA was approximately 1,000 fold lower than that of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. These results indicate that streptococcal LTA possesses various immunobiological activities that modulate lymphoreticular system in vivo and in vitro.
TI  - Molecular analysis of DNA and construction of genomic libraries of Mycobacterium  leprae.
AB  - Molecular analysis of DNA from Mycobacterium leprae, "Mycobacterium lufu," and Mycobacterium vaccae has demonstrated that the G + C (guanine plus cytosine) contents of the DNAs are 56, 61, and 65%, respectively, and that the genome sizes are 2.2 X 10(9), 3.1 X 10(9), and 3.1 X 10(9) daltons, respectively. Because of the significant differences in both G + C content and genome size among M. leprae, "M. lufu," and M. vaccae DNAs, these species are not related, although hybridization experiments under nonstringent conditions, with two separate cloned M. leprae DNA inserts as probes, indicate that there are some conserved sequences among the DNAs. The G + C content of Dasypus novemcinctus (armadillo, the animal of choice for cultivating M. leprae) DNA was determined to be 36%. Genomic libraries potentially representing more than 99.99% of each genome were prepared by cloning into the cosmid vector, pHC79, in Escherichia coli K-12. A genomic library representing approximately 95% of the genome of M. vaccae was prepared in pBR322. M. leprae DNA was subcloned from the pHC79::M. leprae library into an expression vector, pYA626. This vector is a 3.8-kilobase derivative of pBR322 in which the promoter region of the asd (aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) gene from Streptococcus mutans has been inserted in place of the EcoRI-to-PstI fragment of pBR322. Several (44% of those tested) pYA626::M. leprae recombinants and one pBR322::M. vaccae recombinant synthesized new polypeptides in minicells of E. coli, indicating that mycobacterial DNA can be expressed in E. coli K-12, although expression is probably dependent upon use of nonmycobacterial promoters recognized by the E. coli transcription-translation apparatus.
TI  - Expression of a gene for glucan-binding protein from Streptococcus mutans in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The structural gene for a glucan-binding protein (GBP) of Streptococcus mutans has been inserted into a bacteriophage lambda vector and expressed in Escherichia coli K12. Lysates of E. coli infected with the recombinant phage contain an antigenic protein of the same size as S. mutans GBP. The GBP synthesized in E. coli can be affinity-purified on immobilized glucan and antiserum raised against it has been shown to precipitate fructosyltransferase activity from S. mutans.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics on adherence of microorganisms to epithelial cell surfaces.
AB  - Microbial adherence to epithelial cell surfaces has been implicated as the first  step in the initiation of several infectious diseases. Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics affect the adherence properties of microorganisms in various ways. They can inhibit the expression of fimbriae and the synthesis of other surface components, and they may also cause the release of constituents from the cell. The ability of antibiotics to affect the properties of microbial adherence to cell surfaces may be an important criterion in selecting an antibiotic for therapy.
TI  - Streptococcus-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pSA3 and its use in the cloning of  streptococcal genes.
AB  - A shuttle vector that can replicate in both Streptococcus spp. and Escherichia coli has been constructed by joining the E. coli plasmid pACYC184 (chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance) to the streptococcal plasmid pGB305 (erythromycin resistance). The resulting chimeric plasmid is designated pSA3 (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistance) and has seven unique restriction sites: EcoRI, EcoRV, BamHI, SalI, XbaI, NruI, and SphI. Molecular cloning into the EcoRI or EcoRV site results in inactivation of chloramphenicol resistance, and cloning into the BamHI, SalI, or SphI site results in inactivation of tetracycline resistance in E. coli. pSA3 was transformed and was stable in Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans in the presence of erythromycin. We have used pSA3 to construct a library of the S. mutans GS5 genome in E. coli, and expression of surface antigens in this heterologous host has been confirmed with S. mutans antiserum. A previously cloned determinant that specifies streptokinase was subcloned into pSA3, and this recombinant plasmid was stable in the presence of a selective pressure and expressed streptokinase activity in E. coli, S. sanguis (Challis), and S. mutans.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.

TI  - Effect of peroral immunization of humans with Streptococcus mutans on induction of salivary and serum antibodies and inhibition of experimental infection.
AB  - Naturally occurring antibodies reactive with Streptococcus mutans whole cells were assayed in whole saliva, parotid saliva, and blood samples collected from eight human volunteers. The levels and serotypes of indigenous S. mutans in plaque and whole saliva samples were also determined. After baseline sampling the teeth were cleaned and the subjects were inoculated with streptomycin-resistant S. mutans strains Ingbritt (serotype c) and OMZ65 (serotype g). The level of implantation and duration of colonization were determined in plaque and saliva, and antibodies reactive with these strains were monitored in saliva and serum. After the implanted bacteria were shed, the subjects wee immunized by the daily ingestion of an enteric-coated capsule containing 25 mg of Formalin-killed, freeze-dried OMZ65 cells for 3 days and inoculation was repeated. The levels of antibodies and of implantation and the duration of colonization were monitored as before. One month after the bacteria could no longer be detected, the immunization and inoculation cycle was repeated except that the subjects were immunized for 7 days. Five of the eight subjects were successfully colonized by strains Ingbritt and OMZ65. The remaining three did not become colonized with either strain. Strain OMZ65 implanted at a higher level than did strain Ingbritt. Oral immunization did not result in a detectable antibody response in saliva or serum to whole bacterial cells. However, after both the first and second immunizations there were marked reductions in the peak levels of infection and the duration of colonization of both OMZ65 and Ingbritt.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Characterization and expression of a cloned tetracycline resistance determinant from the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A chromosomal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinant previously cloned from Streptococcus mutans into Streptococcus sanguis (Tobian and Macrina, J. Bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982) was characterized by using restriction endonuclease mapping, deletion analysis, and Southern blot hybridization. Deletion analysis allowed localization of the Tcr determinant to a 2.8-kilobase region of the originally cloned 10.4-kilobase sequence. This cloned determinant hybridized to a representative of the tetM class of streptococcal Tcr determinants but not to representatives of the tetL and tetN classes and, like other tetM determinants, mediated high-level resistance to tetracycline and low-level resistance to minocycline. A portion (approximately 3 kilobases) of the isolated streptococcal fragment was subcloned into Escherichia coli, where it conferred resistance to tetracycline and minocycline. Two proteins with apparent molecular weights of 33,000 and 35,000, encoded by the S. mutans DNA, were synthesized in E. coli minicells. Insertion of DNA into a unique SstI site of the cloned S. mutans fragment resulted in inactivation of Tcr expression in E. coli and S. sanguis, as well as loss of production of both the 33,000- and 35,000-dalton proteins in E. coli minicells. Incubation of minicells in subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline did not result in changes in the levels of synthesis of either protein. Our data suggest that at least one of these proteins is involved in the expression of Tcr.
TI  - Resolution of the phosphotransferase enzymes of Streptococcus mutans: purification and preliminary characterization of a heat-stable phosphocarrier protein.
AB  - The sucrose phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus mutans catalyzes the phosphorylation of sucrose to sucrose-6-phosphate with concomitant translocation of this disaccharide across the cytoplasmic membrane in reactions requiring intracellular phosphoenolpyruvate. Soluble proteins released by vigorous homogenization of cells with glass beads are shown to be necessary for the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of sucrose in combination with one or more proteins that remain tightly associated with the membrane fraction. We have partially purified phosphotransferase enzyme I and have purified a heat-stable phosphocarrier protein (HPr) to apparent homogeneity, by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography from the soluble fraction. HPr from S. mutans has an apparent molecular weight larger than that of Escherichia coli HPr but has properties similar to those of Staphylococcus aureus HPr. Furthermore, it appears to be partially complexed with a heat-stable enzyme III-like protein in cell-free fractions from S. mutans, and we also report the purification of this complex. Enzyme I from S. mutans is a protein (native Mr greater than 100,000) that cross-complements enzyme I from S. aureus. Preliminary characterizations of homogeneous HPr and its complex with the putative enzyme III are also presented.
TI  - [Compatibility and efficacy of Meditonsin].
AB  - Heavy metals, including mercury, have recently been in discussion in connection with ecology and therapy. As Meditonsin represents a 0,004% solution of mercury cyanide the following were investigated: absorption, excretion, effect on the kidneys and the chemical behaviour of mercury cyanide and other mercury salts as well as the antimicrobial effectivity in in vitro tests. With the dose recommended for adults neither an increase of mercury ions nor an increased excretion of these could be detected in the blood or the urine respectively. Even in minimal inhibitory concentrations Meditonsin is characterised in the in vitro tests by an excellent antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Physical and genetic analyses of streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 and cloning of  its replication region.
AB  - Plasmid pAM beta 1, originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis DS5, mediates resistance to the MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B alpha) group of antibiotics. A restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pAM beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes AvaI, HpaII, EcoRI, PvuII, Kpn1, BstEII, HpaI, HhaI, and HindIII. A comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pAM beta 1 located the MLS resistance determinant within a 2-kb DNA segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb Escherichia coli plasmid vector, pACKC1, and used to transform E. coli HB101. The 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform Streptococcus sanguis Challis with concurrent expression of the E. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of Streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid DNA. Subcloning experiments, using a HindIII partial digest of pAM beta 1 DNA, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.

TI  - Ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  - The present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (PFN). Avid binding of 125I-PFN was found for Streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), Streptococcus sanguis, group A Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible PFN binding ability. Two gram-negative bacterial species, Bacteroides gingivalis and Escherichia coli, did not significantly bind PFN. 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled PFN, and the radiolabeled PFN bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled PFN. Strong inhibition of 125I-PFN binding to S. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. These results suggest that PFN binding to S. mutans cells is reversible and that PFN receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.
TI  - Purification of proteins similar to HPr and enzyme I from the oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius. Biochemical and immunochemical properties.
AB  - The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is made of several  proteins. Two of them are designated general proteins because they are required for the transport and phosphorylation of all sugars of the PTS. These two proteins are found in the soluble fraction of cellular extracts and are termed HPr and enzyme I (EI). We reported in this work the purification and the characterization of these two proteins from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975. HPr was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA44, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the presence of urea revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 6700. The protein contained no tryptophan and had a pI of 4.8. The purification scheme of EI was as follows: DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA34. The five-step purification for EI produced a 199-fold purified preparation with a specific activity of 530 mumol of HPr phosphorylated per minute per milligram of protein at 37 degrees C. The fraction obtained after filtration on Ultrogel AcA34 gave one band (68 000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 135 000, suggesting that it was a dimer. Enzyme I had a pI of 4.2, a pH optimum of 6.7, a Km for HPr of about 27 microM, a Km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.48 mM, and kinetics that were consistent with a Ping-Pong mechanism. Evidence had been obtained which indicated that S. salivarius enzyme I was antigenically very similar to enzyme I from various strains of Streptococcus mutans, but not to the enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli.

TI  - Isolation, partial purification and preliminary characterization of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans Rm-10.
AB  - An extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of Streptococcus mutans Rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. There was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. Vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. It was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase C. The inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions of the bactericidal material. The results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. Activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. It was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli.

TI  - Salivary immunoglobulin A antibodies and recovery from challenge of Streptococcus mutans after oral administration of Streptococcus mutans vaccine in humans.
AB  - Heat-killed Streptococcus mutans was administered orally in two periods of 1 week to six subjects in an attempt to affect the salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) response to this bacterium. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect specific IgA antibody activity, and an immunofluorescent assay was used for measurement of total IgA in parotid saliva. The salivary IgA response to S. mutans was compared with that against a noncross-reacting antigen preparation from Escherichia coli and with antibody responses in five sham-immunized subjects. No change in salivary IgA response to S. mutans was observed after oral administration of this organism. Significantly less streptomycin-resistant S. mutans could be recovered from the six test subjects than from the five controls after the first of two challenges with streptomycin-resistant microorganisms. At the day of the first challenge, a significantly higher IgA antibody response to all tested antigens was observed in the test group than in the control group. The data show that this difference was not related to the oral administration of S. mutans but rather was an occasional finding. The coincidence of a rapid elimination of the challenge strain and a high IgA antibody response to S. mutans supports the concept that salivary IgA antibodies could have a biological significance in the human defense against cariogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Regulation of hexitol catabolism in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Regulation of hexitol catabolism was investigated in Streptococcus mutans, a cariogenic human dental plaque bacterium. Induction of hexitol catabolic enzymes and phosphoenolpyruvate:hexitol phosphotransferase and hexitol phosphate dehydrogenase activities was regulated by an inducer exclusion mechanism initiated by D-glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Kinetic analysis of the inhibitory effect of 2-deoxy-D-glucose on initial hexitol uptake illustrated that this was a noncompetitive type of inhibition. In mutant strains of S. mutans lacking phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase activity, 2-deoxy-D-glucose was unable to inhibit hexitol uptake. These observations provide evidence for possible molecular mechanisms for the exclusion process.
TI  - Clustered genes for galactose metabolism from Streptococcus mutans cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - DNA cloned into Escherichia coli from a serotype c strain of Streptococcus mutans allowed a galKTE mutant to utilize galactose for growth. However, the DNA does not appear to encode enzymes of the Leloir pathway used by E. coli, but rather appears to encode enzymes of the tagatose phosphate pathway.
TI  - Expression of a Streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA from Streptococcus mutans strain UAB90 (serotype c) was cloned into Escherichia coli K-12. The clone bank was screened for any sucrose-hydrolyzing activity by selection for growth on raffinose in the presence of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside. A clone expressing an S. mutans glucosyltransferase was identified. The S. mutans DNA encoding this enzyme is a 1.73-kilobase fragment cloned into the HindIII site of plasmid pBR322. We designated the gene gtfA. The plasmid-encoded gtfA enzyme, a 55,000-molecular-weight protein, is synthesized at 40% the level of pBR322-encoded beta-lactamase in E. coli minicells. Using sucrose as substrate, the gtfA enzyme catalyzes the formation of fructose and a glucan with an apparent molecular weight of 1,500. We detected the gtfA protein in S. mutans cells with antibody raised against the cloned gtfA enzyme. Immunologically identical gtfA protein appears to be present in S. mutans cells of serotypes c, e, and f, and a cross-reacting protein was made by serotype b cells. Proteins from serotype a, g, and d S. mutans cells did not react with antibody to gtfA enzyme. The gtfA activity was present in the periplasmic space of E. coli clones, since 15% of the total gtfA activity was released by cold osmotic shock and the clones were able to grow on sucrose as sole carbon source.
TI  - Proteinaceous bacterial adhesins and their receptors.
AB  - The adhesion of bacteria to surfaces is an ecologically important property which  enables them to colonize their natural habitats. Adhesion between bacteria mediated by sex pili and aggregation substances may also promote gene transfers. In this review, we describe the adhesive properties of bacteria (to eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, and inert surfaces) and emphasize the characteristics of adhesins (structure, function, genetics, and morphology) and their cognate receptors on target surfaces. The physiochemical interactions between bacteria and surfaces can be described by the DLVO theory, but the interaction between bacterial adhesins and their receptor is better described as a ligand receptor interaction. The DLVO theory predicts that no physical contact can occur between bacteria and surface and, hence, predicts that adhesins must be filamentous in order to bridge the space between the two bodies and allow attachment of the bacteria. Adhesins are primarily proteinaceous, although adhesins of streptococci may involve dextrans or lipoteichoic acids. The cognate receptors for adhesins all appear to contain carbohydrates and as such as likely to be glycoconjugates with carbohydrate moieties acting as the receptor sites.
TI  - Effect of 2-alkynoic acids on in vitro growth of bacterial and mammalian cells.
AB  - 3-Decynoyl-N-acetylcystamine is known to inhibit the in vitro growth of Escherichia coli but not of yeasts or mammalian cells. Neither the free acid nor the 2 positional isomer is active (L. R. Kass, J. Biol. Chem. 243:3223-3228, 1968). Other studies have shown that 2-hexadecynoic acid is fungitoxic whereas most of the shorter chain isomers are inactive (H. Gershon and L. Shanks, Can J. Microbiol. 24:591-597, 1978). Since these studies suggested that positional or chain length isomers of the acetylenic acids may selectively inhibit the growth of microorganisms, the effect of the alkynoic acids on the in vitro growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. 2-Hexadecynoic acid was found to be the most active species. This acid was bacteriostatic for all gram-positive bacteria tested. The acid was readily taken up by the treated cells and incorporated into the phospholipid fraction. When added to the culture medium, 2-hexadecynoic acid inhibited the growth of HeLa cells, but when mixed with an equivalent amount of palmitic acid, growth inhibition was not observed.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans genes that code for extracellular proteins in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Chromosomal DNA from Streptococcus mutans 6715 (serotype g) was cloned into Escherichia coli K-12 by using the cosmid pJC74 cloning vector and a bacteriophage lambda in vitro packaging system. Rabbit antiserum against S. mutans extracellular proteins was used for immunological screening of the clone bank. Twenty-one clones produced weak to strong precipitin bands around the colonies, but only after the lambda c1857 prophage was induced by being heated to lyse the E. coli cells. None of the clones expressed enzyme activity for several known S. mutans extracellular enzymes. One of these clones contained a 45-kilobase recombinant plasmid designated pYA721. An 8.5-kilobase fragment of S. mutans DNA from pYA721 was isolated and recloned into the BamHI restriction site of the plasmid vector pACYC184 to construct pYA726. pYA726 contained all, or nearly all, of the gene for a surface protein antigen (the spaA protein) of S. mutans 6715. This was deduced from immunological studies in which extracts of cells harboring pYA726 reacted with antisera against both purified 6715 spaA protein (about 210,000 daltons) and the immunologically similar antigen I/II of serotype c strains of S. mutans. In addition, the S. mutans spaA protein was found to possess at least one antigenic determinant not present on the protein specified by pYA726. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of E. coli clone extracts revealed that pYA726 produced a polypeptide with a molecular mass of about 180,000 daltons which was predominantly found in the periplasmic space of E. coli cells. Antisera to the spaA protein of S. mutans reacted with extracellular protein from representative strains of S. mutans serotypes a, c, d, e, f, and g, but not b.

AB  - In the presence of endodontic gutta-percha cones, several species of bacteria were killed in vitro. Silver points, when compared with gutta-percha cones, were not or were considerably less effective against the target organism. Staphylococcus aureus, in our assay system. Growth of bacteria in serum could be abolished by the mere presence of gutta-percha, especially when time was allowed for previous contact between the serum and the cones. It is concluded that gutta-percha cones possess a slowly acting, relatively weak, but, in our opinion, significant inherent antimicrobial property.
TI  - Expression of Streptococcus mutans aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene cloned into plasmid pBR322.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans chromosomal DNA cloned into the vector plasmid pBR322 in Escherichia coli is able to complement the metabolic defect of an aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.11) gene (asd) deletion in the host strain. We constructed two Asd+ recombinant plasmids, pYA570 and pYA571, containing 4.7 and 4.5 kilobases, respectively, of S. mutans chromosomal DNA inserted into the HindIII restriction endonuclease site of pBR322 in the same orientation. The S. mutans UAB62 Asd+ DNA did not hybridize with E. coli DNA which contained an intact asd gene, but did not hybridize with S. mutans UAB62 chromosomal DNA. Derivative Asd+ plasmids were then constructed from pYA570. One, pYA574, had a 4.5 kilobase S. mutans insert DNA in the opposite direction from pYA570. In another pYA575, the S. mutans insert DNA was reduced in size to 1.3 kilobases. It was seen that the orientation of the S. mutans DNA fragment inserted into the promotor region of the pBR322 tetracycline resistance (Tcr) gene affected expression of Tcr. Orientation of the S. mutans insert also affected the stability of the plasmid in certain E. coli strains. Restriction maps for pYA570, pYA571, pYA574 and pYA575 using the endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, PstI and SalI were determined, Asd+ plasmid-directed protein synthesis was studied in E. coli minicells. The plasmids pYA570, pYA574 and pYA575 each produced large amounts of a protein with a monomeric molecular weight of about 45000, that was distinct from both pBR322 and E.coli specified proteins: this protein is the S. mutans asd gene product. Smaller derivatives of recombinant plasmid pYA575 that were Asd- allowed the location of the S. mutans asd gene promotor and the direction of transcription to be determined.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate protect bacteria from hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate were shown to protect Escherichia coli and three  oral streptococcal species from the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic conditions. Lactoperoxidase in the absence of thiocyanate was also protective for two of the bacterial species in a dilution medium but potentiated hydrogen peroxide toxicity for the other two under the same conditions. The products of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate in the presence of lactoperoxidase were not bactericidal except in the case of E. coli, and then only under special conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate in protecting living cells from hydrogen peroxide toxicity. Although the effect on human cells was not examined in this study, extrapolation of these results to the cells of the oral mucosa would suggest an important protective role of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate against the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide in the oral cavity.
TI  - Effect of linolenyl alcohol on the in-vitro growth of the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The effect of primary aliphatic alcohols of varying chain length and degree of unsaturation on bacterial growth was assessed, using Strep. mutans BHT as the main test organism. Unsaturated alcohols, linoleyl and linolenyl, effectively inhibited bacterial growth. Of the saturated alcohols, only lauryl and myristyl alcohols inhibited the growth of Strep. mutans BHT, but at concentrations much higher than those required for the unsaturated alcohols. All Gram-positive organisms tested were sensitive to linolenyl alcohol. Gram-negative bacteria did not exhibit the sensitivity. Linoleic and linolenic acid were inactive as antibacterial agents at the same concentration as the related alcohol. Repeated exposure of Strep. mutans BHT to linolenyl alcohol produced no change in the sensitivity of the organism to the alcohol. Significant amounts of linolenyl alcohol were found in bacteria grown in the presence of this lipid for 24 h but linolenic acid was not detected. Thus the primary polyunsaturated aliphatic alcohols, particularly linolenyl alcohol, could be effective antibacterial agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.
TI  - Fluorescent bacterial rosetting of lymphocyte subpopulations. I. Methodology.
AB  - Fluorochrome-labelled bacteria were tested for their rosette-forming properties with human lymphocytes in suspension. Acridine orange stained human buffy coat cells or isolated mononuclear cells are rosetted with tetramethyl-rhodamine-isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labelled bacterial strains alone (mono-bacterial rosetting test) or simultaneously with a TRITC-labelled strain and a mutant or taxonomically different strain, labelled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (double bacterial rosetting test [D-BRT]). Suspensions are centrifuged, washed, finally counterstained with ethidium bromide and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The bacterial binding properties of B cells may be studied by using anti-Ig pretreated mononuclear cells and TRITC bacteria (anti-Ig/BRT). In this study the methodology for bacterial staining, mono-, double- and anti-Ig/BRT is given. Estimation of rosette-forming cells is very accurate, easy and quick due to the bright fluorescence of the bacterial 'beads'. Furthermore, broad applicability of the bacterial rosetting phenomenon to study lymphocyte heterogeneity is gained with the fluorescent assay system.
TI  - Bacterial adherence: adhesin-receptor interactions mediating the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surface.
AB  - Recent studies have indicated that the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surfaces is the initial event in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases due to bacteria in animals and humans. An understanding of the mechanisms of attachment and a definition of the adhesive molecules on the surfaces of bacteria (adhesins) as well as those on host cell membranes (receptors) have suggested new approaches to the prevention of serious bacterial infections: (1) application of purified adhesion or receptor materials or their analogues as competitive inhibitors of bacterial adherence; (2) administration of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics that suppress the formation and expression of bacterial adhesins; and (3) development of vaccines against bacterial surface components involved in adhesion to mucosal surfaces. Progress has already been made in the development of antiadhesive vaccines directed against the fimbrial adhesins of several human bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Simple filter paper procedure for estimation of glucose uptake via group translocation by whole-cell suspensions of bacteria.
AB  - A simple and rapid filter paper technique is described for processing samples from glucose uptake studies with whole cells of gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria that transport glucose via group translocation. The procedure yields results equivalent to those obtained with a conventional membrane filtration method and requires no special filtration equipment or source of vacuum.
TI  - Characterization of the Streptococcus mutans plasmid pva318 cloned into Escherichia coli.
AB  - We further characterized the cryptic plasmid pVA318 of Streptococcus mutans. It had a contour length of 5.64 +/- 0.26 kilobases and a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 32 to 34 mol %. Upon cloning the pVA318 plasmid into the vector pBR322 in Escherichia coli, we made the following observations. The expression of tetracycline resistance by HindIII-cloned chimeras, where the insert was in the tetracycline resistance promotor, depended on the orientation of the pVA318 insert. Both HindIII-cloned chimeras segregated from polA(Ts) cells at a nonpermissive temperature. Chimeric molecules cloned with PstI initially showed much instability; the reason for this is unknown, although stable variants were obtained. Both HindIII-cloned variants and a PstI-cloned chimera produced a pVA318-specific protein of approximately 20,000 molecular weight in E. coli minicells. The biological function of this protein is not known; it had no bacteriocin activity against S. mutans or group A Streptococcus indicator strains, and it did not appear in the E. coli periplasm. We constructed a map of pVA318 for restriction endonucleases HindIII, HpaI, PstI, and HaeIII. A previously reported BamHI site in pVA318 did not appear in the pVA318 portion of any of our chimeric clones.
TI  - Effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - We examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (S. mitis, A. viscosus, S. aureus, E. coli). We observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. Heat treatment (80 degrees C, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. Supplementation of saliva with H(2)O(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. S. mitis and A. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by H(2)O(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by S. mutans and S. mitis required ca. 10 muM H(2)O(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. Loss of the inhibitory action of saliva occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. Supplementation of saliva dilutions with SCN(-) and H(2)O(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca. 0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. We suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. Furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and SCN(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. The resistance of A. viscosus, S. aureus, and E. coli to the inhibitory potential of saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. The resistance of S. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on H(2)O(2) accumulation by this organism compared with S. mutans and S. sanguis. The basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. The role of the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.
TI  - Molecular cloning in streptococci: physical mapping of the vehicle plasmid pSM10  and demonstration of intergroup DNA transfer.
AB  - The streptococcal resistance plasmid pSM10 (8.3 kb), a deletion derivative of pSM10419 (22.9 kb) determining constitutive erythromycin and lincomycin resistance, was physically mapped with the restriction endonucleases AvaI, AvaII, EcoRI, HpaI, KpnI, PvuII (one site each), HindIII, HaeII (three sites each), HincII (four sites), and HhaI (five sites). Using the cryptic plasmid pVA318 as cloning vehicle, the largest HindIII fragment of pSM10 (3.3 kb) was shown to contain the erythromycin/lincomycin resistance gene(s) of the plasmid. The AvaII site of pSM10 proved to be suitable as a site for cloning AvaII-generated chromosomal DNA fragments from a group C streptococcal strain in the Challis strain of Streptococcus sanguis (group) H). A detailed physical map of the chimeric plasmid pSM10221 (12.8 kb), a fusion product of pSM10 and the staphylococcal chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pC221 (4.5 kb), is also presented. The plasmid chimera has properties making it potentially useful in development of a doubly selective streptococcal cloning vehicle by searching for insertional inactivation.
TI  - Immunotherapy of the guinea pig line 10 hepatocarcinoma with a variety of nonviable bacteria.
AB  - A variety of heat-killed bacteria were tested for their capacity to induce regressions of established line 10 hepatocarcinomas in syngeneic guinea pigs. Multiple intralesional injections of heat-killed Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes resulted in complete regression of the tumor in a majority of guinea pigs. Repeated injections of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin caused no regressions. Surviving animals were immune to subsequent challenge with line 10 cells but not L2C cells, another syngeneic tumor.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of human lactoferrin: sensitivity of a variety of microorganisms.
AB  - Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that has been detected in secretions that  bathe human mucosal tissues. Previous studies have shown that, when this protein is in the iron-free state, it is capable of a direct bactericidal effect on Streptococcus mutans and Vibrio cholerae. The present study demonstrates variable susceptibilities for a variety of different microorganisms. The list of susceptible organisms includes gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, rods and cocci, facultative anaerobes, and aerotolerant anaerobes. Similar morphological and physiological types are represented among the lalctoferrin-resistant bacteria. S. mutans was more resistant to lactoferrin when grown on a sucrose-contaning medium than when it was grown on brain heart infusion broth without added scurose. When a lactoferrin-sensitive, avirulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was passed through mice, the resultant virulent culture became lactoferrin resistant. Since organisms of the same species and even of the same strain (S. pneumoniae) can differ in susceptibility to lactoferrin, it appears that accessibility to the lactoferrin target site may account for differences in susceptibility. It appears that there may be a relation between virulence and resistance to lactoferrin.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of dental cements.
AB  - It was observed that some of the cements tested had bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal action. The cements listed in decreasing order of effectiveness are (1) zinc oxide-eugenol, (2) silicophosphate, (3) zinc phosphate, and (4) silicate. The two newer cements, polycarboxylate and composite resin, exhibited no measurable antimicrobial action.
TI  - Adenylate energy charge: a method for the determination of viable cell mass in dental plaque samples.
AB  - The biochemical function, adenylate energy charge (AEC), correlates with the viable count of S. mutans. AEC may be used to estimate the percent viable fraction of bacteria in dental plaque samples. An interactive computer program designed to process the AEC data is described.
TI  - Binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by Streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  - Lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (GTase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)C]sucrose. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to GTase. These cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than did the cells of the remaining serotypes. Lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to GTase than did the controls without added enzyme. Lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of GTase. Lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. These results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated GTase does not create additional GTase binding sites in S. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. Ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the S. mutans strains after exposure to GTase. Of these species, S. sanguis, Actinomyces viscosus, and A. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. Three mutant strains of S. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of GTase as the control. These results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of S. mutans. The results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than S. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free GTase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. The results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of S. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.
TI  - Use of extractable adenosine triphosphate to estimate the viable cell mass in dental plaque samples obtained from monkeys.
AB  - The viable cell mass in plaque samples obtained from monkeys was estimated by determining the concentration of extractable adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and total cell mass was estimated by measuring the protein content. The results were expressed in terms of the specific ATP and protein contents of Streptococcus sanguis. The viable counts estimated by these techniques were comparable to or exceeded viable counts obtained by other investigators using conventional bacteriological methods.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. It contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. Its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Mycobacterium lepraemurium. When used as an antigen in rabbits, the S. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. This antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of S. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other streptococci, such as S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. lactis. The inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of S. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of O(2) (-). A variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. The iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of H(2)O(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. Some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. Indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. There was no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their Gram-stain reaction.
TI  - Cellular adherence, glucosyltransferase adsorption, and glucan synthesis of Streptococcus mutans AHT mutants.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans AHT mutants M1, M2, and M13 failed to adhere to a glass surface, whereas mutants M9 and M35 exhibited decreased and increased adherence, respectively, as compared with the parent strain, when grown in sucrose broth. Extracellular glucosyltransferase prepared from glucose-grown cultures of the adherent strains (wild type, M9, and M35) induced adherence of heat-killed cells of the homologous and heterologous streptococcal strains as well as of Escherichia coli K-12 and uncoated resin particles. The glucosyltransferase was adsorbed on all the streptococcal cells and glucan-coated resins, but not on E. coli cells and the uncoated resins. Glucosyltransferase from the nonadhering mutants (M1, M2, M13) neither was significantly adsorbed on nor induced adherence of any of the cells and resins. Cell-free enzymes from the glucose-grown adherent strains produced water-soluble and water-insoluble glucans, whereas those from the nonadhering mutants produced only water-soluble glucans. Small amounts of alkali-soluble, cell-associated glucan were recovered from the sucrose-grown nonadhering mutants. Thus, the relative proportions of glucosyltransferase isozymes elaborated by the S. mutans mutants, insofar as they affect the physico-chemical properties of the glucans produced, seem to determine the adherence abilities of the cells. The adsorption of glucosyltransferase on glucan molecules on the cell surface is not required for the adherence of S. mutans, but de novo glucan synthesis is important in the adherence process.

AB  
TI  - A bactericidal effect for human lactoferrin.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans and Vibrio cholerae, but not Escherichia coli, were killed by incubation with purified human apolactoferrin. Concentrations of lactoferrin below that necessary for total inhibition resulted in a marked reduction in viable colony-forming units. This bactericidal effect was contingent upon the metal-chelating properties of the lactoferrin molecule.
TI  - Determinants of the developing oral flora in normal newborns.
AB  - The ability of Streptococcus species to selectively adhere to the oral epithelial cells of newborns was studied in vitro. On day 1 of life, mucosal cells from normal infants demonstrated selective attraction for the natural distribution of streptococci that would soon colonize these surfaces. Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis adhered well in vitro to scraped cells from cheek and tongue surfaces. Streptococcus mutans, on the other hand, exhibited feeble or no adherence to cheek or tongue cells. Adherence of Escherichia coli to oral epithelial cells was also studied. The ability of strains of E. coli to adhere to cheek and tongue cells correlated solely with the presence of cell surface substances, probably pili. These observations, made on infants at the critical moment of their developing flora, strengthen the hypothesis that the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is an important determinant of their ecological place in the oral microflora.
TI  - Effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
TI  - Production and properties of an extracellular bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans bacteriocidal for group A and other streptococci.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of Streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. The lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts of a standardized suspension of group A streptococci in broth. No lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen in electron micrographs. The material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups A, C, D, G, H, L, and O streptococci. It was inactive against strains of S. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. It was sensitive to trysin and Pronase and resistant to catalase. It possessed a molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. The properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. Group A streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as did the sensitive cells. The bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 C.
TI  - Liquid nitrogen cryo-impacting: a new concept for cell disruption.
AB  - High-efficiency disruption of bacteria can be accomplished in 2 or more min by the new procedure of liquid nitrogen cryo-impacting. Release of the dipicolinic acid-Ca2+ chelate paralleled the breakage of Bacillus megaterium endospores. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was much better in supernates from liquid nitrogen cryo-impacting-broken Escherichia coli cells than in those from sonically treated and broken E. coli cells.
TI  - Chemical composition of the washed cells of Streptococcus sanguis (804) and Streptococcus mutans (B-14).
AB  - Washed cells of Streptococcus saguis (804) and Streptococcus mutans (B14) were analyzed for water, ash, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and nucleic acid content. Lipids were analyzed by gas chromatography. Ash was subjected to elemental analysis. These data were compared with the published values for the composition of dental plaque.
TI  - The effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. III. Bacteriolysis induced by extracts of different leukocyte populations and the inhibition of lysis by macromolecular substances.
AB  - The lysis of 14C-labeled bacteria by hydrolases of human and rabbit leukocytes was studied in vitro. While Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans were highly susceptible to lysis, Staphylococcus auresus was intermediate in its susecptibility to lysis by the leukocyte enzymes. Group A Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium smegmatis were very resistant to degradation by these enzymes. The lytic activity of leukocyte lysates from human and rabbit blood was probably due to acid hydrolases of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Extracts of human blood monocytes and of rabbit peritoneal and lung macrophages were less lytic for the bacteria tested. Lymphocytes and platelet extracts were not bacteriolytic. The lytic effect of the leukocyte lysates was not inhibited by KCN or sodium azide, but was abolished to a large extent by cationic polyelectrolytes such as protamine sulfate, histone and leukocyte cationic proteins, and poly-lysine, as well as by the anionic polyelectrolytes such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, DNA, carrageenin, alginate sulfate, dextran sulfate, and ploy-L-glutamic acid. Other potent inhibitors of bacteriolysis were trypan blue, congo red, phosphatidic acid, normal immunoglobulins, and components of streptococcal cell wall.

TI  - Fluorometric determination of deoxyribonucleic acid in bacteria with ethidium bromide.
AB  - A simple, sensitive, and rapid method is presented for the determination of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is based upon the fluorometric determination of DNA with ethidium bromide after alkaline digestion of the bacteria to hydrolyze the interfering ribonucleic acid. The assay takes less than 2 hr. Its sensitivity is at least 0.2 mug of DNA in a final solution of 4 ml and it uses commonly available filter or double monochromator fluorometers. Judicious choice of light source and filters allows an additional 10-fold increase in sensitivity with a filter fluorometer. Turbidity caused by bacteria or insoluble polysaccharides does not interfere with the fluorescence measurements. There was no significant difference between the results obtained with this method and those obtained with the indole and diphenylamine methods when these assays were applied to Escherichia coli and sucrose- or glucose-grown Streptococcus mutans. The method was also tested by determining the specific growth rate of E. coli. This new procedure should be especially useful for the determination of bacterial DNA in dilute suspensions and for the estimation of bacterial growth or DNA replication where more conventional methods are not applicable or sensitive enough.
TI  - Use of a fiber optic probe for spectral measurements and the continuous recording of the turbidity of growing microbial cultures.
AB  - This paper describes the properties and use of a fiber optic probe as an attachment to a spectrophotometer and its use for measurements in solutions and turbid suspensions. Measurements of a standard were identical when a spectrophotometer equipped with the probe was used or when a spectrophotometer was used in a conventional manner. The probe was calibrated for turbidimetric measurements with microorganisms by relating the apparent absorbancy measured on the spectrophotometer to the dry weight of each species of organism. Continuous measurements were made of the turbidity of growing cultures of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transient changes in cell mass were observed in some cultures during continuous monitoring of growth. The data were recovered in a manner which allowed direct computer processing.
