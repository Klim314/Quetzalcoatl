TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == men 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, pbp affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of men 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that men 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < or = 0.5 mg/l) and against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 mg/l), with reduced activity only against providencia stuartii (mic90 = 8 mg/l). men 10700 was also active against  anaerobic species such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis as well as moraxella catarrhalis. it was moderately active against enterococcus faecalis and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those  of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. men 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class i enzymes. it bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of escherichia coli.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total  of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l)  and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ru29246, the active metabolite of hr916b.
AB  == hr 916b is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. in tests its active metabolite, ru29246, inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. it was also more active (mic 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. ru29246 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor,  but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. it did not inhibit pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens or  bacteroides fragilis. ru29246 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, staphylococcus aureus  tem-2 or moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and morganella morganii. plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by ru29246.

TI  == combination of ofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == we evaluated the combination of ofloxacin with piperacillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, rifampin, clindamycin, and metronidazole by the checkerboard agar dilution method against 165 isolates which included escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and citrobacter perfringens. synergy of piperacillin-ofloxacin was demonstrated for 50% and 40% respectively of e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa. some ofloxacin and  piperacillin-resistant isolates were susceptible with the combination. ofloxacin-gentamicin was indifferent for aerobic gram-negative species. ofloxacin and vancomycin or gentamicin was indifferent for s. aureus and e. faecalis, but rifampin-ofloxacin showed addition. combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole or clindamycin or erythromycin was indifferent for aerobic and anaerobic species. ofloxacin could be combined with piperacillin with benefit against p. aeruginosa, but combination with aminoglycosides is not of benefit.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study,  identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also  had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == in-vitro studies with ciprofloxacin, a new 4-quinolone compound.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new antibacterial agent of the 4-quinolone group. with an agar dilution technique we compared its activity on 365 clinical isolates with those of norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime,  ceftazidime, ceftriazone , cefotaxime, latamoxef (moxalactam), and gentamicin. ciprofloxacin was overall the most active agent tested against aerobic gram-negative species, with the mic90 values for all species being below 1 mg/l (excepting providencia stuartii with 4 mg/l), and the large majority being below  0.12 mg/l. many of the strains were selected on the basis of resistance to beta-lactam agents or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin was also active against these. there was little difference in the activity of ciprofloxacin at inocula of 10(4) or 10(6) cfu. strains with higher mic's of the related agents norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were less susceptible to ciprofloxacin . ciprofloxacin was less active against gram-positive species (typical mic90 values were 0.5 or 1 mg/l) and obligate anaerobes (4 mg/l for bacteroides fragilis). the activity of ciprofloxacin in broth dilution tests was little affected by ph over the range 6.0-8.0, or by human serum or tissue fluid; its activity was reduced by the presence of urine. binding to human serum protein was 20-28%. ciprofloxacin was rapidly bacterial in broth at concentrations near to its mics. by exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin it was possible to increase its mic for bacteria in daily subcultures. the final mic values after ten days were often about 16-fold greater than those observed initially.
