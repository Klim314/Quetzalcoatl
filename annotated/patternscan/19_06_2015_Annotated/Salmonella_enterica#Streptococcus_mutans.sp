TI  == activity of kaempferia pandurata (roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract against mrsa, mrcns, mssa, bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhi.
AB  == temu kunci (kaempferia pandurata (roxb.)) has a number of benefits and one of these is antibacterial. the rhizome is said to have antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactocillus sp. and candida albicans. the aim of the study is to test the antibacterial activity of kaempferia pandurata (roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhi. antimicrobial activity of the extract was assayed by the microdilution method using mueller hinton broth with sterilized 96 round-bottomed microwells to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) as well as to  determine the time-kill activity. the mic of the extract was 16 ppm for both bacillus subtilis and mrsa; 8 ppm for both mssa and salmonella typhi and 4 ppm for mrcns. ethanol extract of kaempferia pandurata (roxb.) showed antibacterial activity against all the tested bacteria and was the most potent against mrcns, with mic 4 ppm. the killing profile test of the extract displayed bactericidal activity at 8-16 ppm against mrsa, mssa, bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhi and bacteriostatic activity at 4 ppm towards mrcns.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented manzanilla alorena green table olives.
AB  == manzanilla alorena (or alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (dop). the aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (lab) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. a collection of 144 lab obtained from alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (smes) from malaga (spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. rep-pcr clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different smes were lactobacillus pentosus. pediococci were identified as pediococcus parvulus (sme1) and leuconostocs as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (sme1 and sme4). genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees c and in the presence of 6.5% nacl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. however, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. on the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low ph and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.

TI  == the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our  knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)]  and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested,  while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for  this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == contribution of a streptococcus mutans antigen expressed by a salmonella vector vaccine in dendritic cell activation.
AB  == a salmonella vector vaccine expressing the saliva-binding region (sbr) of the adhesin agi/ii of streptococcus mutans has been shown to induce a mixed th1/th2 anti-sbr immune response in mice and to require toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), tlr4, and myd88 signaling for the induction of mucosal anti-sbr antibody responses. since dendritic cells (dc) are critical in innate and adaptive immunity, the present study assessed the role of sbr expression by the vector vaccine in dc activation. bone marrow-derived dc from wild-type and tlr2, tlr4, and myd88 knockout mice were stimulated with salmonella vector brd509, the sbr-expressing salmonella vector vaccine brd509(psbrt7), or sbr protein, and the  dc responses to different stimuli were compared by assessing costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production, and signaling pathways. the dc response to both brd509(psbrt7) and brd509 was dependent mainly on tlr4. brd509(psbrt7) and brd509 induced upregulation of cd80, cd86, cd40, and major histocompatibility complex class ii (mhc ii) expression. lower levels of interleukin-10 (il-10) and  il-12p40 were produced by brd509(psbrt7)-stimulated dc than by brd509-stimulated  dc. furthermore, brd509(psbrt7)-stimulated dc showed decreased p38 phosphorylation compared to that induced by dc stimulated with brd509. however, brd509(psbrt7)-treated dc produced a higher level of il-6 than brd509-stimulated  cells. the low il-12p40 and high il-6 cytokine profile expressed by brd509(psbrt7)-stimulated dc may represent a shift toward a th2 response, as suggested by the increased expression in jagged-1. these results provide novel evidence that a heterologous protein expressed by a salmonella vector vaccine can differentially affect dc activation.

TI  == enhanced protection against nasopharyngeal carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae elicited by oral multiantigen dna vaccines delivered in attenuated salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == developing carrier systems and choosing appropriate antigens are essential steps  in improving the safety and efficacy of streptococcus pneumoniae dna vaccines, which have enhanced the mucosal protection against nasopharyngeal colonization. in this study, we reconstructed a salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system, which was used as carrier to orally deliver the streptococcus pneumoniae multiantigen dna vaccines encoding psaa (pneumococcal surface adhesion a) and pspa' (n-terminal of pneumococcal surface protein a) genes. the results showed that the multiantigen dna vaccines using the new vector system as carrier afforded better protection than the vaccination with injected intramuscularly (i.m.) against streptococcus pneumoniae d39 colonization infection in balb/c mice models. this finding has associated with a high level of siga in the nasal mucosa as well as systemic igg antibodies and a shift toward a  th1-mediated immune response. these studies have demonstrated the feasibility and advantage of using the new salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system as carrier to deliver s. pneumoniae dna vaccines.

TI  == immunogenicity of salmonella vector vaccines expressing sbr of streptococcus mutans under the control of a t7-nirb (dual) promoter system.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to determine if a salmonella vector expressing the cloned saliva-binding region (sbr) of streptococcus mutans or sbr  linked to the a2 and b subunits of cholera toxin (cta2/b) under the control of both the t7 and nirb promoters (t7-nirb dual promoter) was more effective in inducing mucosal and systemic anti-sbr antibody responses than salmonella clones  expressing the same antigens but under the control of either the nirb or t7 promoter. mice were immunized by the intranasal route on days 0, 18 and 320 with  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain brd 509 containing one of six plasmids encoding sbr or sbr-cta2/b under the control of the t7-nirb, t7, or nirb promoter. serum, saliva and vaginal wash samples were collected throughout the experiment and assessed for antibody activity by elisa. evidence is provided that salmonella clones expressing sbr or sbr-cat2/b under the control of either the t7 or t7-nirb promoter induced a high and persistent mucosal and systemic anti-sbr antibody response. all salmonella clones induced good anti-sbr responses following the boost on day 320.

TI  == bacterial defenses against oxidants: mechanistic features of cysteine-based peroxidases and their flavoprotein reductases.
AB  == antioxidant defenses include a group of ubiquitous, non-heme peroxidases, designated the peroxiredoxins, which rely on an activated cysteine residue at their active site to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite. in the typical 2-cys peroxiredoxins, a second  cysteinyl residue, termed the resolving cysteine, is also involved in intersubunit disulfide bond formation during the course of catalysis by these enzymes. many bacteria also express a flavoprotein, ahpf, which acts as a dedicated disulfide reductase to recycle the bacterial peroxiredoxin, ahpc, during catalysis. mechanistic and structural studies of these bacterial proteins  have shed light on the linkage between redox state, oligomeric state, and peroxidase activity for the peroxiredoxins, and on the conformational changes accompanying catalysis by both proteins. in addition, these studies have highlighted the dual roles that the oxidized cysteinyl species, cysteine sulfenic acid, can play in eukaryotic peroxiredoxins, acting as a catalytic intermediate in the peroxidase activity, and as a redox sensor in regulating hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell signaling.

TI  == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == effect of attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing a streptococcus mutans antigen on secondary responses to the cloned protein.
AB  == attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium has been used for targeted delivery of recombinant antigens to gut- and nose-associated lymphoid tissues. contradictory reports have described the effect of preexisting immunity to the antigen delivery vehicle. we decided to examine this discrepancy by studying the  effect of immunizing mice by the intranasal (i.n.) route with salmonella expressing an insoluble protein and to study the ability to augment recall responses by boosting with either salmonella-expressed protein or purified soluble protein alone. the glucan-binding domain (glu) of the enzyme glucosyltransferase (gtf), which is an important virulence factor of streptococcus mutans, was recombinantly expressed in the insoluble phase in s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and the immunogenicity of this construct was studied in mice. we examined the induction of primary immune responses by insoluble glu polypeptide delivered in salmonella at week 1 (groups 1 and 2) and  recall responses after a week 15 boost with either salmonella expressing glu (group 1) or purified glu polypeptide (groups 2 and 3). group 4 served as the control and received phosphate-buffered saline alone by the i.n. route. significant anti-glu serum immunoglobulin g (igg) levels were seen in groups 1, 2, and 3 at week 18 (p < 0.001), i.e., 3 weeks after the booster immunization. mice in group 2, who received salmonella followed by glu, had the highest glu-specific igg levels among all groups. the serum igg levels persisted in all responding groups for at least 7 weeks after the boost (week 22). the igg2a/igg1  subclass ratio of serum anti-glu antibodies in group 1 significantly increased after the boost. these results support the induction of a type 1-like immune response to glu after primary and booster immunizations with salmonella expressing glu. on the other hand, group 2 mice, which received salmonella expressing glu as the primary dose and soluble protein as the booster dose, exhibited a shift from a type 1-like to a more type 2-like immune response to glu following the boost. these results indicate that s. enterica serovar typhimurium  is an excellent delivery vehicle for the insoluble and recombinantly expressed glu of gtf and that this construct was especially effective in priming the host for a secondary response to soluble glu polypeptide.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == induction of protective immunity against streptococcus mutans colonization after  mucosal immunization with attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing an s. mutans adhesin under the control of in vivo-inducible nirb promoter.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the  saliva-binding region (sbr) of the streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii adhesin, either alone or linked with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin a2 and b subunits  (cta2/b) and under the control of the anaerobically inducible nirb promoter, in inducing a protective immune response against s. mutans infection. balb/c mice were immunized by either the intranasal or the intragastric route with a single dose of 10(9) or 10(10) salmonella cfu, respectively. the salmonella vaccine strain expressing an unrelated antigen (fragment c of tetanus toxin [tetc]) was also used for immunization as a control. samples of serum and secretion (saliva and vaginal washes) were collected prior to and following immunization and assessed for antibody activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. anti-sbr antibodies were detected in the serum and saliva of experimental animals by week  3 after immunization. a booster immunization at week 17 after the initial immunization resulted in enhanced immune responses to the sbr. the serum immunoglobulin g subclass profiles were indicative of t helper type 1 responses against both the vector and the sbr antigen. to determine the effectiveness of these responses on the protection against s. mutans infection, mice were challenged after the second immunization with a virulent strain of s. mutans which was resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. prior to the challenge, mice were treated for 5 days with tetracycline, erythromycin, and penicillin. s.  mutans was initially recovered from all of the challenged mice. this bacterium persisted at high levels for at least 5 weeks in control tetc-immunized or nonimmunized mice despite the reappearance of indigenous oral organisms. however, mice immunized with salmonella clones expressing sbr or sbr-cta2/b demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of s. mutans present in plaque compared to the control groups. these results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the salmonella vector in delivering the sbr antigen for the induction of mucosal and  systemic immune responses to sbr. furthermore, the induction of a salivary anti-sbr response corresponded with protection against s. mutans colonization of  tooth surfaces.

TI  == construction and characterization of a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium clone expressing a salivary adhesin of streptococcus mutans under control of the  anaerobically inducible nirb promoter.
AB  == attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium has been used for targeted delivery of recombinant antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. one potential problem associated with this vaccine approach is the likelihood of in vivo instability of the plasmid constructs caused by constitutive hyperexpression of the heterologous immunogen. the aim of this study was to generate and characterize an expression system encoding the saliva-binding region (sbr) of streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii adhesin, either alone or linked with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin a2/b subunits (cta2/b), under the control of the inducible nirb promoter. this promoter is activated in an anaerobic environment and within macrophages, which are the primary antigen-presenting cells involved in phagocytosis and processing of salmonella. the gene encoding the chimeric sbr-cta2/b was amplified by pcr using primers containing appropriate restriction  sites for subcloning into ptetnirb, which contains the nirb promoter. the resulting plasmid was introduced into serovar typhimurium by electroporation. production of the sbr-cta2/b chimeric protein under anaerobic conditions was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of whole-cell lysates on plates coated with g(m1) ganglioside and developed with antibodies to sbr. similar procedures were followed for cloning the gene encoding sbr in serovar typhimurium under nirb control. anaerobic expression of sbr was confirmed by western blotting of whole-cell lysates probed with anti-sbr antibodies. the resulting serovar typhimurium strains were administered by either the oral or the intranasal route  to mice, and colonization was assessed by microbiologic analysis of dissociated spleens, peyer's patches (pp), and nasal tissues. high numbers of the recombinant strains persisted in pp and spleen for at least 21 days following oral challenge. a single intranasal administration of the salmonella clones to mice also resulted in the colonization of the nasal tissues by the recombinant bacteria. salmonellae were recovered from nasal lymphoid tissues, superficial lymph nodes, internal jugular lymph nodes, pp, and spleens of mice for at least 21 days after challenge. this study provides quantitative evidence for colonization by salmonella strains expressing a recombinant protein under the control of the inducible nirb promoter in pp or nasal tissues following a single oral or nasal administration of the bacteria, respectively.

TI  == streptococcus mutans h2o2-forming nadh oxidase is an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase protein.
AB  == nox-1 from streptococcus mutans, the bacteria which cause dental caries, was previously identified as an h2o2-forming reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) oxidase. nox-1 is homologous with the flavoprotein component, ahpf, of salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. a partial open reading frame upstream of nox1, homologous with the other (peroxidase) component, ahpc, from the s. typhimurium system, was also identified. we report here the complete sequence of s. mutans ahpc. analyses of purified ahpc together with nox-1 have verified that these proteins act as a cysteine-based peroxidase system in s. mutans, catalyzing the nadh-dependent reduction of organic hydroperoxides or h2o2 to their respective alcohols and/or h2o. these proteins also catalyze the four-electron reduction of o2 to h2o2, clarifying the role of nox-1 as a protective protein against oxygen toxicity. major differences between nox-1 and ahpf include: (i) the absolute specificity of nox-1 for nadh; (ii) lower amounts  of flavin semiquinone and a more prominent fadh2 to nad+ charge transfer absorbance band stabilized by nox-1; and (iii) even higher redox potentials of disulfide centers relative to flavin for nox-1. although nox-1 and ahpc from s. mutans were shown to play a protective role against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo in escherichia coli, the lack of a significant effect on deletion of these genes from s. mutans suggests the presence of additional antioxidant proteins in these bacteria.

TI  == construction and oral immunogenicity of a salmonella typhimurium strain expressing a streptococcal adhesin linked to the a2/b subunits of cholera toxin.
AB  == a major adhesin from the oral pathogen streptococcus mutans has been shown to be  mucosally immunogenic upon genetic fusion with the cholera toxin a2/b subunits. to take advantage of the ability of salmonella typhimurium to deliver cloned antigens to the mucosal inductive sites that would obviate the need for antigen purification, we expressed this chimeric construct in an attenuated s. typhimurium strain under the control of bacteriophage t7 transcription. residual  expression of the temperature-regulated t7 rna polymerase at 30 degrees c allowed production of the chimeric protein at 2-3% of the total soluble protein, but it was increased five to six times following induction at 37 degrees c. oral administration of a single dose of 10(9) recombinant salmonella to mice resulted  in serum igg and salivary iga antibody responses to salmonella, cholera toxin, and the streptococcal adhesin, which were generally enhanced after a booster immunization.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and analysis of the vibrio alginolyticus sucrose uptake-encoding region.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the vibrio alginolyticus sucrose uptake-encoding region was determined, and contained two genes, scra and scrk. the scra gene encodes an enzyme iisucrose (eiiscr) protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system and the scrk gene encodes a fructokinase. the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence for the v. alginolyticus eiiscr protein was homologous with the eiiscr proteins from streptococcus mutans, salmonella typhimurium (pur400 system) and bacillus subtilis. the deduced aa sequence for the v. alginolyticus fructokinase was homologous with the escherichia coli enzymes, 6-phosphofructokinase (isoenzyme 2) and ribokinase. transposon phoa mutagenesis experiments indicated that the eiiscr protein was a membrane-bound protein with a region that extended into the periplasm.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the asd gene of salmonella typhimurium: use in stable maintenance of recombinant plasmids in salmonella vaccine strains.
AB  == the asd mutants of salmonella typhimurium have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (dap) and will undergo lysis in environments deprived of dap. this has allowed the development of a balanced-lethal system for the expression of heterologous antigens in vaccine strains using vectors containing the wild-type asd gene from streptococcus mutans and asd mutant salmonella hosts [nakayama et al., biotechnology 6 (1988) 693-697]. we have cloned the asd gene from s. typhimurium, characterized the gene product and used this gene to construct asd+ expression cloning vectors. in addition we have constructed an asd cassette and a transposon derived from tn5 that allow the rapid modification of other vectors for use with delta asd vaccine strains of s. typhimurium adding versatility to the asd+ vector/delta asd host system of plasmid maintenance.

TI  == recombinant avirulent salmonella vaccine strains with stable maintenance and high level expression of cloned genes in vivo.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium strains with deletion (delta) of the adenylate cyclase (cya) and cyclic amp receptor protein (crp) genes are avirulent for mice and induce a high level of protective immunity to oral challenge with up to 10,000 times what would be a lethal dose of wild-type virulent s. typhimurium cells. this immunity begins as early as seven days after immunization and lasts for at least four months. s. typhimurium delta cya delta crp mutants stably maintain plasmids and give high-level expression of cloned gene products; in this they appear superior to other avirulent s. typhimurium strains. s. typhimurium delta cya delta crp strains with a delta asd mutation (abolishing production of aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase), have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (dap). this strain can be used in conjunction with plasmid vectors lacking antibiotic resistance markers but having the wild-type asd+ gene  from streptococcus mutans to complement the delta asd chromosomal mutation. the asd+ plasmid vector can be used to express a diversity of colonization and virulence antigens from other pathogens. in the delta cya delta crp delta asd s.  typhimurium vaccine strain, the plasmid is completely stable in the absence of any exogenous selective pressure either in vitro or in vivo.

TI  == differentiation and interaction of secretory immunoglobulin a and a calcium-dependent parotid agglutinin for several bacterial strains.
AB  == previous studies have suggested that both secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) and various nonimmunoglobulin salivary glycoproteins are capable of agglutinating a variety of bacteria. the present study was designed to compare the nature of the  agglutinins for streptococcus mutans and salmonella typhimurium in parotid saliva and colostrum. s. mutans was aggregated by saliva and colostrum, whereas s. typhimurium was aggregated only by saliva as detected by a spectrophotometric method. the principal salivary agglutinin for both s. mutans and s. typhimurium was calcium dependent and could be desorbed in phosphate-buffered saline (ph 6.8). in contrast, the colostral agglutinin was calcium independent and not readily desorbed. the agglutinin activities of saliva and colostrum for s. mutans were additive, suggesting independent target sites on the bacterial surface. the  agglutinin activity of colostrum was totally associated with siga as was suggested by blocking of the agglutinating activity with anti-alpha-chain serum and the absence of blocking with an antibody specific for salivary agglutinin. interestingly, anti-alpha-chain serum removed all agglutinating activity from saliva, but not from the phosphate-buffered saline-desorbed agglutinin. dialysis  of parotid saliva against 0.1 m disodium edta eliminated the agglutinin blocking  activity of anti-alpha-chain serum but not that of the antiagglutinin antibody. the ability of anti-alpha-chain serum to block agglutination of the edta-dialyzed saliva could be restored by the addition of calcium chloride, suggesting that siga and salivary agglutinin are associated through a calcium-mediated interaction. these results indicate that bacterial agglutinating activity of colostrum, as detected spectrophotometrically, is mediated by siga, and that of saliva is mainly dependent upon a calcium-dependent nonimmunoglobulin agglutinin. the agglutinating activities of siga and parotid agglutinin seem to be additive,  and their calcium-dependent association may favor the enhancement of their respective activities.

TI  == in vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmid molecules for analyses of salmonella typhimurium, streptococcus mutans, and mycobacterial genomic libraries.
AB  == strains of escherichia coli k-12 were constructed that permitted the amplification of in vitro-packaged recombinant cosmid-transducing particles by in vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmid molecules. thermal induction of these thermoinducible, excision-defective lysogens containing recombinant cosmid molecules yielded high titers of packaged recombinant cosmids and low levels of pfu. these strains were used to amplify packaged recombinant cosmid libraries of  mycobacterium leprae, mycobacterium vaccae, salmonella typhimurium, and streptococcus mutans dna. contiguous and noncontiguous libraries were compared for the successful identification of cloned genes. construction of noncontiguous  libraries allowed the dissociation of desired genes from genes that were deleterious to the survival of a cosmid recombinant and permitted selection for unlinked traits that resulted in a selected phenotype. in vivo repackaging of recombinant cosmids permitted amplification of the original in vitro-packaged collection of transducing particles, storage of cosmid libraries as phage lysates, facilitation of complementation screening, expression analysis of repackaged recombinant cosmids after uv-irradiated cells were infected, in situ enzyme or immunological screening, and facilitation of recovery of recombinant cosmid molecules containing transposon inserts.

AB  == fluorochrome-labelled bacteria were tested for their rosette-forming properties with human lymphocytes in suspension. acridine orange stained human buffy coat cells or isolated mononuclear cells are rosetted with tetramethyl-rhodamine-isothiocyanate (tritc)-labelled bacterial strains alone (mono-bacterial rosetting test) or simultaneously with a tritc-labelled strain and a mutant or taxonomically different strain, labelled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (double bacterial rosetting test [d-brt]). suspensions are centrifuged, washed, finally counterstained with ethidium bromide and examined by fluorescence microscopy. the bacterial binding properties of b cells  may be studied by using anti-ig pretreated mononuclear cells and tritc bacteria (anti-ig/brt). in this study the methodology for bacterial staining, mono-, double- and anti-ig/brt is given. estimation of rosette-forming cells is very accurate, easy and quick due to the bright fluorescence of the bacterial 'beads'. furthermore, broad applicability of the bacterial rosetting phenomenon to study lymphocyte heterogeneity is gained with the fluorescent assay system.

TI  == a simplified procedure for measuring the class of anti-bacterial antibodies by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin haemagglutination (mrpah).
AB  == a modified procedure is described for performing the mrpah (mixed reverse passive antiglobulin haemagglutination) reaction as a simple micro-method to measure the  classes of bacterial antibodies. this 'bacterial dilution procedure' gave results closely correlated with those obtained by the 'serum (sample) dilution procedure' previously reported and with great economy of materials, labour and time. the method was used to investigate human serum antibodies to br. abortus and s. enteritidis and serum and secretory antibodies to strep. mutans. the good reproducibility of the mrpah reaction was demonstrated by re-examining brucellosis sera tested one year previously. mrpah was sufficiently sensitive to  demonstrate the small amounts of igg and igm antibodies to strep. mutans in human colostrum and early milk. a rise of antibody levels in the different immunoglobulin classes g, a and m was readily demonstrated in sera from individuals with salmonellosis.
