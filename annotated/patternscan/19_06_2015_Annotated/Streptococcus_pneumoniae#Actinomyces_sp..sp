TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == two autonomous structural modules in the fimbrial shaft adhesin fima mediate actinomyces interactions with streptococci and host cells during oral biofilm development.
AB  == by combining x-ray crystallography and modelling, we describe here the atomic structure of distinct adhesive moieties of fima, the shaft fimbrillin of actinomyces type 2 fimbriae, which uniquely mediates the receptor-dependent intercellular interactions between actinomyces and oral streptococci as well as host cells during the development of oral biofilms. the fima adhesin is built with three igg-like domains, each of which harbours an intramolecular isopeptide  bond, previously described in several gram-positive pilins. genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that although these isopeptide bonds are dispensable for fimbrial assembly, cell-cell interactions and biofilm formation,  they contribute significantly to the proteolytic stability of fima. remarkably, fima harbours two autonomous adhesive modules, which structurally resemble the staphylococcus aureus cna b domain. each isolated module can bind the plasma glycoprotein asialofetuin as well as the polysaccharide receptors present on the  surface of oral streptococci and epithelial cells. thus, fima should serve as an  excellent paradigm for the development of therapeutic strategies and elucidating  the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between cellular receptors and gram-positive fimbriae.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == microbial communities of the upper respiratory tract and otitis media in children.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae asymptomatically colonizes the upper respiratory tract of children and is a frequent cause of otitis media. patterns of microbial colonization likely influence s. pneumoniae colonization and otitis media susceptibility. this study compared microbial communities in children with and without otitis media. nasal swabs and clinical and demographic data were collected in a cross-sectional study of philadelphia, pa, children (6 to 78 months) (n=108) during the 2008-2009 winter respiratory virus season. swabs were  cultured for s. pneumoniae. dna was extracted from the swabs; 16s rrna gene hypervariable regions (v1 and v2) were pcr amplified and sequenced by roche/454 life sciences pyrosequencing. microbial communities were described using the shannon diversity and evenness indices. principal component analysis (pca) was used to group microbial community taxa into four factors representing correlated  taxa. of 108 children, 47 (44%) were colonized by s. pneumoniae, and 25 (23%) were diagnosed with otitis media. microbial communities with s. pneumoniae were significantly less diverse and less even. two pca factors were associated with a  decreased risk of pneumococcal colonization and otitis media, as follows: one factor included potentially protective flora (corynebacterium and dolosigranulum), and the other factor included propionibacterium, lactococcus, and staphylococcus. the remaining two pca factors were associated with an increased risk of otitis media. one factor included haemophilus, and the final factor included actinomyces, rothia, neisseria, and veillonella. generally, these taxa are not considered otitis media pathogens but may be important in the causal pathway. increased understanding of upper respiratory tract microbial communities will contribute to the development of otitis media treatment and prevention strategies.

TI  == structure and molecular characterization of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide 10f by carbohydrate engineering in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although closely related at the molecular level, the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of serotype 10f streptococcus pneumoniae and coaggregation receptor polysaccharide (rps) of streptococcus oralis c104 have distinct ecological roles. cps prevents phagocytosis of pathogenic s. pneumoniae, whereas rps of commensal s. oralis functions as a receptor for lectin-like adhesins on other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. results from high resolution nmr identified  the recognition region of s. oralis rps (i.e. galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha) in the hexasaccharide repeat of s. pneumoniae cps10f. the failure of this polysaccharide to support fimbriae-mediated adhesion of actinomyces naeslundii was explained by the position of galf, which occurred as a branch in cps10f rather than within the linear polysaccharide chain, as in rps. carbohydrate engineering of s. oralis rps with wzy from s. pneumoniae attributed formation of  the galf branch in cps10f to the linkage of adjacent repeating units through sub  terminal galnac in galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha rather than through terminal  galf, as in rps. a gene (wcrd) from serotype 10a s. pneumoniae was then used to engineer a linear surface polysaccharide in s. oralis that was identical to rps except for the presence of a beta1-3 linkage between galf and galnacbeta1-3galalpha. this polysaccharide also failed to support adhesion of a.  naeslundii, thereby establishing the essential role of beta1-6-linked galf in recognition of adjacent galnacbeta1-3galalpha in wild-type rps. these findings, which illustrate a molecular approach for relating bacterial polysaccharide structure to function, provide insight into the possible evolution of s. oralis rps from s. pneumoniae cps.

TI  == etiology and outcome of community-acquired lung abscess.
AB  == background: anaerobes are the first and streptococcus species the second most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess (cala) in the west. the etiologic pathogens of this disease have changed in taiwan, with klebsiella pneumoniae being reported as the most common cause of cala. objective: to determine the etiologies of community-acquired lung abscess. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the records of 205 japanese adult patients with cala to evaluate etiologies and outcomes. we used not only traditional microbiological investigations but also percutaneous ultrasonography-guided transthoracic needle  aspiration and protected specimen brushes. results: of these 205 patients, 122 had documented bacteriological results, with 189 bacterial species isolated. pure aerobic, mixed aerobic and anaerobic, and pure anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 90 (73.8%), 17 (13.9%), and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. the four most common etiologic pathogens were streptococcus species (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), gemella species (9.8%), and k. pneumoniae (8.2%). streptococcus mitis was the most common among the streptococcus species. mean duration of antibiotic administration was 26 days. six patients (2.9%, 3 with actinomycosis and 3 with nocardiosis) were treated with antibiotics for 76-189 days. two patients with anaerobic lung abscess died. conclusions: the first and second most common etiologic pathogens of cala in our hospital were streptococcus species and anaerobes, respectively. the etiologies in our study differ from those in taiwan  and are similar to those in the west with the exception that streptococcus species were the most common etiologic pathogens in our study whereas anaerobes are the most frequent etiologic pathogens in western countries. s. mitis and gemella species are important etiologic pathogens as well. the identification of  actinomyces and nocardia is important in order to define the adequate duration of antibiotic administration.

TI  == central nervous system infections in filipino patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  == background and purpose: infections including those of the central nervous system  (cns) are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). this case series describes the etiology, contributing factors and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle.  design: retrospective case series. methods: we reviewed the medical records of sle patients diagnosed and confined for a cns infection at the university of santo tomas hospital in manila, philippines, from 1997 to 2007. results: a total  of 23 sle patients (22 females) diagnosed with cns infection were included in this study. the mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at sle diagnosis, and 30.9  years (range 14-58) at cns infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months (range 7-125). nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were diagnoses of brain abscess. the etiologic agents were identified as cryptococcus  neoformans in seven (30.4%), mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), salmonella sp. in one (4.4%), corynebacterium bovis with actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five  (21.7%). the average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10 patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. most cases had active sle; the lone patient in disease remission had s. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy.  the most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). the infection resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. conclusion: we described the etiology  and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle. risk factors included active sle in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. although c. neoformans and m. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease in highly susceptible hosts. a high index of suspicion and early appropriate management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.

TI  == molecular analysis of pericardial fluid: a 7-year experience.
AB  == aims: aetiological investigations of pericardial effusion are often negative. we  evaluate the interest of systematic analysis of fluid in order to diminish the number of pericarditis classified as idiopathic. methods and results: we performed a systematic analysis of pericardial fluid and biopsy specimens, using  cultures and molecular analyses for the identification of bacteriological, fungal, and viral agents, as well as histopathological examination of 106 pericardial fluid samples. the aetiological diagnosis was determined clinically and by non-invasive procedures in 40 and nine patients, respectively. in the remaining 57 patients, 14 neoplasias and 17 infections were diagnosed. molecular  procedures identified seven viral (enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, and epstein-barr virus in four, two, and one of the cases, respectively), one fungal  (cryptococcus neoformans), and nine bacterial infections. four of these bacteria  were not diagnosed by culture because of prior antibiotics treatment (mycobacterium tuberculosis in two cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in one case, and actinomyces neuii in one case). the aetiology remained undetermined in 26 patients. conclusion: the systematic use of molecular techniques permitted a significant increase in aetiological diagnoses of punctured pericardial effusions when compared with cultures (39.5 vs. 13.9%, respectively; p<0.01). it is particularly beneficial for patients with a previous antibiotic regimen or suspicion of tuberculosis.

TI  == use of shell-vial cell culture assay for isolation of bacteria from clinical specimens: 13 years of experience.
AB  == the shell-vial culture assay is performed routinely in our laboratory. recently we revisited our experience of using the shell-vial culture assay for the isolation of microorganisms from various clinical samples. over a 13-year period, we have isolated 580 bacterial strains (5%) from 11,083 clinical samples tested.  over the same period, 285 isolates of rickettsiae, bartonellae, or coxiella burnetii were cultured from a total of 7,102 samples tested. these isolates include 55 rickettsia sp. isolates, 95 coxiella burnetii isolates, and 135 bartonella sp. isolates. based on our experience with the growth of fastidious microorganisms, we have used a centrifugation shell-vial technique called jnsp, for "je ne sais pas" ("i don't know [what i am growing]") for the isolation of other microorganisms. a total of 173 isolates were cultured from the 3,861 clinical samples tested using the jnsp method. of these, 40 isolates had not been grown before on usual axenic medium. these include 2 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 7 isolates of streptococcus sp. and related genera, 6 mycobacterium sp. isolates, 1 nocardia asteroides isolate, 1 actinomyces sp. isolate, 1 brucella melitensis isolate, 2 francisella tularensis isolates, 1 mycoplasma pneumoniae isolate, and 1 legionella pneumophila isolate. using this protocol, we have also  cultured intracellular bacteria such as chlamydia trachomatis and we have performed the first culture and establishment of trophyrema whipplei. applied in  our laboratory, the shell-vial culture generally exhibits a low rate of success.  however, in some cases, this technique allowed microbial diagnosis when classical agar procedure and pcr were negative.

TI  == etiologic diagnosis of 204 pericardial effusions.
AB  == the etiologic evaluation of pericardial effusion is frequently unsuccessful when  noninvasive methods are used. to determine the cause of the current episode, all  patients with echographically identified pericardial effusion from may 1998 to december 2002 underwent noninvasive diagnostic testing of blood, throat, and stool samples. patients with postpericardiotomy syndrome were excluded. to analyze the value of our tests, we tested randomly selected blood donors as negative controls. among 204 included patients, 107 (52.4%) had a final etiologic diagnosis: the etiology of 52 was highly suspected at first examination and later confirmed (thyroid deficiency, 5 cases; systemic lupus erythematous, 7; rheumatoid arthritis, 7; scleroderma, 3; cancer, 25; and renal insufficiency, 5). a definite etiologic diagnosis was made in 11 patients from pericardial fluid analysis (cancer, 5 cases; tuberculosis, 3; streptococcus pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, and actinomyces, 1 case each). among 141 patients considered to have idiopathic pericarditis, 44 (32.1%) gained an etiologic diagnosis by our systematic testing strategy. this included serologic evaluation of serum (coxiella burnetii, 10 cases; bartonella quintana, 1; legionella pneumophila, 1;  mycoplasma pneumoniae, 4; influenza virus, 1), viral culture of throat swabs (enterovirus, 8 cases; and adenovirus, 1), high-level antinuclear antibodies (>1/400, 3 cases), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (15 abnormal results). antibodies to toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus, enterovirus recovered from rectal swabs, and low-level antinuclear antibodies were seen with equal frequency in patients and controls. using our evaluation strategy, the number of pericardial effusions classified as idiopathic was less than in other series. systematic testing for q fever, mycoplasma pneumoniae, thyroid abnormalities, and antinuclear antibodies, accompanied by viral throat cultures, frequently enabled  us to diagnose diseases not initially suspected in patients with pericardial effusion.

TI  == improving protein pharmacokinetics by genetic fusion to simple amino acid sequences.
AB  == the role of primary amino acid sequences in protein pharmacokinetics, an issue of relevance in both basic knowledge and biotechnology, was addressed here using as  a starting point two repetitive antigens from the hemoflagellate trypanosoma cruzi that are known to stabilize their associated proteins in the bloodstream. a major drawback to their pharmacological application is that these repetitive sequences are highly immunogenic, being therefore the deletion of this characteristic desirable. based on sequence homology and epitope mapping analyses, an artificial repetitive sequence (pstad) was engineered. this motif was tested by genetic fusion to the c terminus of both the trypanosomal trans-sialidase and the rat tyrosine aminotransferase and found to produce a 4.5-6-fold increase in the half-life of the associated proteins in blood while displaying significantly lower immunogenicity. residues involved in the stabilizing properties of the novel peptide were mapped by a site-directed mutagenesis approach, allowing us to successfully identify another two motifs. searching databases for sequences displaying some homology, embedded in proline frameworks and associated to shed virulence factors from unrelated microorganisms, resulted in the identification of four other protein extensions.  remarkably, three of them (from streptococcus pneumoniae, actinomyces viscosus, and escherichia coli) revealed similar pharmacokinetic features, suggesting therefore an analogous evolutionarily acquired mechanism to ensure the biodistribution of their corresponding proteins. our findings indicate that the insertion of defined motifs into a proline-rich framework constitutes a suitable  alternative to construct a chimeric protein with extended half-life in blood.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  == we studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. we recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. aerobes only were  recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group c beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), prevotella (22 [25.3%]), actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and veillonella (1 [1.1%]). beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). we found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological study of an otitis media outbreak in calves in a dairy herd.
AB  == on a dairy farm, otitis media was diagnosed in 64 suckler calves (21.8%) during a study period of 2 years, and in 10 calves (3.4%) in the third year. the inflammation was unilateral in 63 and bilateral in 11 calves. the affected calves were dull, lacked appetite, were pyrexic and displayed drooping ear or ears and tilted heads with purulent discharge exuding from the external ear canal. of the  affected animals, 56 (87.5%) were aged between 3 and 8 weeks. morbidity was higher during the calving season and during the autumn and winter months (october-december). pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from 21 (32.8%), p. multocida from 20 (31.2%), actinomyces pyogenes from 11 (17.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae from three (4.7%) of the clinically affected calves only during the first two study years. the exudate of the acute ear infections contained, in addition to pasteurella spp., various bacteria and yeasts. most of these bacteria were isolated from healthy ears as well, and are likely to be part of the normal  ear flora. on the other hand most of the yeasts were isolated from otitic calves. after a short course of an appropriate treatment infections healed in all cases.  possible preventive measures are discussed.

TI  == community-acquired bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in harare, zimbabwe.
AB  == background: hiv infection is common in mothers and their children in zimbabwe, and hiv-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. there is little information on the etiology and outcome of hiv-related bacteremia in african children. methods: blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having hiv, were examined for pathogens.  the association among significant bacteremia, hiv infection and mortality was assessed in these children. results: the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). nontyphoidal salmonella (10 children), escherichia coli (4 children) and klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent gram-negative bacteria. two children had rhodococcus equi pneumonia. hiv-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (or) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (or = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (or = 15.76). there was no  significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. mortality was 17%  overall but was higher in hiv-infected children up to 6 months of age (or = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (or = 2.03). conclusions: prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in hiv-infected children in africa.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus gordonii pk488 coaggregation adhesin gene, scaa, and atp-binding cassette.
AB  == human oral viridans group streptococci that coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii pk606 express surface proteins related to scaa, the coaggregation-mediating adhesin of streptococcus gordonii pk488 (r. n. andersen,  n. ganeshkumar, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 61:981-987, 1993). the nucleotide sequence of the 6,125-bp ecori insert of pra1, containing scaa, the gene encoding scaa, was determined. six open reading frames (orfs) were identified. the orientation of four orfs, two upstream (orf 1 and orf 2) and one  downstream (orf 4) of scaa (orf 3), indicated transcription in one direction, whereas orf 5 and orf 6 were transcribed divergently. computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences identified a consensus binding site for atp (gxxgxgks) in the putative 28,054-da protein encoded by orf 1. orf 2 potentially  encoded a hydrophobic protein of 29,705 da with six potential membrane-spanning regions. scaa was 310 amino acids, 34,787 da, and contained the lipoprotein consensus sequence lxxc, also reported for the scaa-related proteins ssab, fima,  and psaa from streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus parasanguis fw213, and streptococcus pneumoniae r36a, respectively. orf 4 potentially encoded a 163-amino-acid protein of 17,912 da, which was nearly identical to the downstream adjacent gene products of ssab, fima, and psaa. no significant homology with other proteins was found with the putative orf 5 gene product, a 229-amino-acid protein of 25,107 da. orf 6 was incomplete and encoded a protein larger than 564  amino acids. this putative protein had a consensus zn2+ binding motif, hexxh, found among bacterial thermolysins and mammalian neutral endopeptidases and was 40% identical to a homologous 210-amino-acid region of human enkephalinase. the genetic organization of orfs 1, 2, and 3 was similar to those of the bacterial periplasmic-binding protein-dependent transport systems of gram-negative bacteria and binding-lipoprotein-dependent transport systems of gram-positive bacteria, and these genes appeared to encode abc (atp-binding cassette) proteins. this report describes a cell-to-cell adherence function associated with an atp-binding cassette.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == isolation of clostridium in human infections: evaluation of 114 cases.
AB  == one hundred fifty-two strains of clostridium were isolated from 144 patients over a 14-month-peroid. these included 23 recognized species and 23 strains that were  unclassified. soft tissues or abscesses yielded 84 strains of clostridium. intraabdominal sites predominated, but clostridia were recovered from empyema, carcinoma, frostbite with gas gangrene, muscle abscess, aortic graft, and brain abscess. blood cultures yielded 65 strains of clostridium from 49 patients, representing 0.3% of 16,314 blood cultures (or 2.6% of 2,168 positive cultures).  clostridium perfringens was most common in blood, accounting for 37 isolates (57%). clostridial bacteremia was often unrelated to the clinical setting and was found in alcoholics with aspiration or streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, meningococcemia, and infantile gastroenteritis.  in 20 of the 49 patients (41%), aerobic or other anaerobic bacteria were cultured concurrently from the blood. thus, clostridial bacteremia should be interpreted with caution since there may be little correlation with the patient's clinical condition.

TI  == non-otogenic cerebral abscess.
AB  == non-otogenic cerebral abscess is becoming relatively more frequent compared with  otogenic. it arises in a setting of sepsis, trauma, or congenital heart disease.  the onset presents a meningo-encephalitic picture, often with two stages, followed by epilepsy and/or a hemiparesis. the best investigations are an eeg and, probably, an isotope scan. the angiogram may be misleading as 40% may not have a midline shift. 'acute localized non-suppurative encephalitis' seems to be  more frequent than in the past. antibiotics and aspiration appear to be the best  treatment.
