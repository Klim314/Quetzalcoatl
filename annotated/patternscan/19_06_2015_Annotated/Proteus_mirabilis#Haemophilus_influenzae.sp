TI  == bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in china: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of chinese county hospitals. a total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from august 2010 to august 2011. drug sensitivity  testing was conducted in a central laboratory. a total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of escherichia coli, 606 klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 staphylococcus aureus, 308 streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 haemophilus influenzae. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in e. coli (42.3% strains), k. pneumoniae (31.7%), and proteus mirabilis (39.0%). ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of e. coli strains. salmonella spp. and shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. less than 8.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. for s. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of s. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of h. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. azithromycin-resistant h. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive m. catarrhalis were recorded. in conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant  strains of e. coli and klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,  with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units in united states and european hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  == treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (icu) represents a great challenge, especially those caused by gram-negative organisms. rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality; resistance rates in the icu can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized in icus (icu patients). the isolates were consecutively collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program  from january 2009 to december 2011 and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. antimicrobial susceptibility results for 5989 bacterial isolates from icu patients (3445 from the united states [usa] and 2544 from europe [eu]) were analyzed and compared to those of 17,244 organisms from non-icu patients (9271 from usa and 7973 from eu). escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated organisms from icu patients, followed by enterobacter spp., serratia spp., haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., and proteus mirabilis. susceptibility rates were generally lower among icu isolates compared to non-icu organisms. e. coli isolates from icu patients exhibited elevated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype rates (13.7% in usa and 16.6% in eu); furthermore, only amikacin (90.5-94.8% susceptibility), colistin (99.8-100.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/ml), imipenem (95.5-96.0%), meropenem (95.4-95.8%), and tigecycline (96.3-98.0%) exhibited good activity against klebsiella spp. esbl-phenotype rates have increased among both e. coli and klebsiella spp. from icu patients in the usa and in europe, with the  most noticeable increase among klebsiella spp. from europe (from 27.5% in 2009 to 41.8% in 2011; p = 0.015 and odds ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.18]). meropenem susceptibility among klebsiella spp. improved slightly in  the usa but decreased markedly in europe from 100.0% in 2009 to 89.7% in 2011. only colistin (99.4% susceptible) and amikacin (97.3% in usa and 84.9% in eu) exhibited good activity against p. aeruginosa strains from icu patients. the greatest differences in susceptibility rates between p. aeruginosa strains from icu and non-icu patients were observed for the anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, such as ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. the results of this  study (101 medical centers) highlight major antimicrobial coverage problems and trends in antimicrobial resistance for usa and eu icu patient isolates.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of prulifloxacin in comparison with other fluoroquinolones against community-acquired urinary and respiratory pathogens isolated in greece.
AB  == prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone rather recently introduced in certain european countries. we compared the antimicrobial potency of ulifloxacin with that of other fluoroquinolones against  common urinary and respiratory bacterial pathogens. the microbial isolates were prospectively collected between january 2007 and may 2008 from patients with community-acquired infections in greece. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (for respiratory isolates only), and ulifloxacin using the e-test method. the binary logarithms of the mics [log2(mics)] were compared by using the wilcoxon signed-ranks test. a total of 409 isolates were studied. ulifloxacin had the lowest geometric mean mic for the 161 escherichia coli, 59 proteus mirabilis, and 22 staphylococcus saprophyticus urinary isolates, the second lowest geometric mean mic for the 38 streptococcus pyogenes respiratory isolates (after moxifloxacin), and the third lowest geometric mean mic for the 114 haemophilus influenzae and the 15 moraxella catarrhalis respiratory isolates (after ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). compared with levofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(mics) against e. coli (p < 0.001),  p. mirabilis (p < 0.001), s. saprophyticus (p < 0.001), and s. pyogenes (p < 0.001). compared with ciprofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(mics) against p.  mirabilis (p < 0.001), s. saprophyticus (p = 0.008), and s. pyogenes (p < 0.001), but higher log2(mics) against h. influenzae (p < 0.001) and m. catarrhalis (p = 0.001). in comparison with other clinically relevant fluoroquinolones, ulifloxacin had the most potent antimicrobial activity against the community-acquired urinary isolates studied and very good activity against the respiratory isolates.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
AB  == we determined mics of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 japanese facilities in 2008. mics were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) accounted for 3.8% of escherichia coli, 2.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of proteus vulgaris. esbl produced strains were 6.8% at k. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at p. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. among haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an mic90 of 1 microg/ml and doripenem showed an mic90 of 4 microg/ml against p. aeruginosa have potent activity. of all p. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. against other  glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.

TI  == proteobacterial arfa peptides are synthesized from non-stop messenger rnas.
AB  == the translation of non-stop mrna (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. in eubacteria, the transfer-messenger rna (tmrna) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes  from non-stop mrna in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. during rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmrna-encoded ssra peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the  arfa peptide. the e. coli arfa message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by rnase iii to produce a non-stop transcript. therefore, arfa levels are controlled by tmrna through ssra-peptide tagging and proteolysis. here, we examine whether arfa homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by rnase iii and tmrna. we searched 431 arfa coding sequences for mrna secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in  their 3'-coding regions. the arfa hairpins from haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, vibrio fischeri, and pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by rnase iii as predicted, whereas the hairpin from neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an  intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mrna. each arfa homologue is ssra-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type e. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmrna. together, these findings show that arfa synthesis from non-stop mrna is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. this strategy ensures that arfa homologues are only deployed when the tmrna system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == objective: to determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. material and method: 1,255 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus spp, streptococcus  pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. results: the mic50 and mic90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. the activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant  (mdr) gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli and k. pneumomiae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. conclusion: sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from thai  patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as mrsa, esbl-producing gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing canward surveillance study. in total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method. compared with other cephalosporins, including  ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with a mic(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (mic(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated mrsa (mic(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against staphylococcus  epidermidis; all isolates of mssa and mrsa tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=1 mug/ml). against streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline mics (mic(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of s. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. all isolates of s. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). among gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (mic(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (mic(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against enterobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across canada in 2009.

TI  == incidence of postoperative eye infections in a private eye hospital in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: there is a dearth of information on postoperative eye infections in nigeria and most hospitals do not have an infection control program in place. objective: this study was done to investigate the incidence of post-operative eye infections, their potential sources and the preparedness of the hospital to prevent such infections. methods: a microbiological survey of all eye surgical procedures between march 2004 and may 2005 was performed. relevant samples were taken and cultured pre, intra and post operatively as required. definitions of infections were based on the centers for disease control (cdc) criteria. in the eye clinic, and operation theatre, infection control procedures and practices were audited using a pre-designed questionnaire. results: there were 2 cases of post operative eye infections (with haemophilus influenzae and corynebacterium species) during the one year of survey of 339 performed surgeries. s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns), and enterobacter spp were cultured from  the aqueous humour, as well as pre and post operative conjunctivae swabs of three other patients. eighty four (24.8%) other patients were colonized post operatively with cns (32), s. aureus (28), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), e. coli (5), corynebacterium species (3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) proteus mirabilis (4), enterobacter species alone (1) and in association with cns on 2 occasions. seventy eight percent of patients had contact with staff who consistently haboured staphylococcus species in their nares. four patients (0.11%) were exposed to surgeons whose hands were contaminated and one eye (0.003%) to contaminated antiseptic solution. facilities for hand washing and protective clothing were adequate but staffs were observed to perform an inadequate hands scrubbing. most items were heat sterilized. cleaning facilities were adequate and the environment was clean. the choice of antiseptic was correct, but that of disinfectant was considered incorrect. the ophthalmic equipments except the eye occluder were appropriately disinfected. staffs were not protected when handling  linen. infected linens were separated from soiled linens only in the theatre. they were not bagged, and were hand sluiced. the only type of waste that was properly handled was sharps. all waste types were stored together prior to final  disposal away from the public. conclusion: the incidence of post-operative infection was 1.69% and their sources were the patients' normal flora. other potential sources of post-operative eye infections identified included nares of hospital staff, hands of surgeon and hospital disinfectants. areas of deficiencies in infection control practices, which require proper infection control policies, include hand scrubbing practices, disinfection, linen management and waste handling.

TI  == adhesion, invasion, and agglutination mediated by two trimeric autotransporters in the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis.
AB  == fimbriae of the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its virulence by mediating adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelia. pmi2122 (aipa) and pmi2575 (taap) are annotated in  the genome of strain hi4320 as trimeric autotransporters with "adhesin-like" and  "agglutinating adhesin-like" properties, respectively. the c-terminal 62 amino acids (aa) in aipa and 76 aa in taap are homologous to the translocator domains of yada from yersinia enterocolitica and hia from haemophilus influenzae. comparative protein modeling using the hia three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these domains would contain four antiparallel beta sheets and that they formed homotrimers. recombinant aipa and taap were seen as approximately 28 kda and approximately 78 kda, respectively, in escherichia coli, and each also formed high-molecular-weight homotrimers, thus supporting this model. e. coli synthesizing aipa or taap bound to extracellular matrix proteins with a 10- to 60-fold-higher level of affinity than the control strain.  inactivation of aipa in p. mirabilis strains significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the mutants' ability to adhere to or invade hek293 cell monolayers, and the functions were restored upon complementation. a 51-aa-long invasin region in the aipa passenger domain was required for this function. e. coli expressing taap mediated autoagglutination, and a taap mutant of p. mirabilis showed significantly (p < 0.05) more reduced aggregation than hi4320. gly-247 in aipa and gly-708 in taap were indispensable for trimerization and activity. aipa and taap individually offered advantages to p. mirabilis in a murine model. this is the first report characterizing trimeric autotransporters in p. mirabilis as afimbrial surface adhesins and autoagglutinins.

TI  == microbiological findings in prepubertal girls with vulvovaginitis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to define the most common causes, symptoms and clinical  features of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls, and to evaluate treatment success depending on the causative agent involved. the study included 115 girls aged 2-8 (mean 4.8) years, presenting with vulvovaginitis to the outpatient clinic for pediatric and adolescent gynecology, zagreb children's hospital, between september 2006 and july 2007. medical history data were obtained from parents. vaginal samples were collected for microbiological culture by using cotton-tipped swabs moistened with saline. all samples were referred to microbiology laboratory, where standard microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed. selective and non-selective media were used. of 115 study patients, 43 (37.4%) had received antibiotic therapy more than one month prior to their visit to the clinic, mainly for upper respiratory tract infection. the most common presenting symptom was increased vaginal discharge usually noticed on the  pants or diaper, found in 26 of 115 (22.6%) patients, followed by vulvar redness  in 16 (13.9%), burning in seven (6.1%), itching in the vulvovaginal area in seven (6.1%), soreness in six (5.2%), odor in three (2.6%) patients, and two or more of these symptoms in another 50 (43.5%) patients. fifty-nine of 115 children had normal clinical finding on gynecologic examination. among the remaining 56 children, the most common finding was erythema observed in 19, vaginal discharge  in ten, and a combination of discharge and erythema in 13 patients. of 115 study  patients, causative agents were isolated from vaginal culture in 38 (33%) cases.  of these, 21 grew group a beta hemolytic streptococcus, five patients haemophilus influenzae, three escherichia coli, two enterococcus spp., and one each staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. antibiotic therapy was administered in 31 of these 38 patients, except for those  cases where intestinal bacteria and staphylococcus aureus were isolated and topical therapy and hygienic measures were applied alone. accordingly, vulvovaginitis in girls was most commonly caused by pathogens originating from the patient upper respiratory tract, accompanied by the symptoms of redness and vaginal discharge. in these cases, antibiotic treatment was administered. in the  majority of prepubertal girls with either vulvitis or normal genital finding, simple measures to improve hygiene will lead to resolution of all symptoms.

TI  == invasive bacteria isolates from children with severe infections in a nigerian hospital.
AB  == background: little information is available about the aetiology and epidemiology  of serious bacterial infections in nigeria. this study determined bacterial isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of children presenting in the emergency room of a teaching hospital in nigeria. method: from october 2005 to december 2006, children aged two to 60 months presenting with signs of acute systemic infections were recruited. blood culture and csf specimens were collected and processed using standard microbiological protocols. data were analysed using spss version 11 software. results: two hundred and two blood and 69 csf samples were cultured. fifty-five (27%) of the blood cultures yielded gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci in almost equal proportions. the most common isolates from the blood cultures were staphylococcus aureus, 26 (12.9%) and atypical coliforms, 13 (6.5%). others are klebsiella spp, 3 (1.5%); klebsiella pneumonia, 2 (1.0%); escherichia coli, 3 (1.5%); enterobacter agglomerans, 2 (1.1%); proteus mirabilis, 2(1%); pseudomonas spp, 2 (1.0%); haemophilus influenza, 1 (1.0%); and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 1 (1.0%). fourteen out of 67 (20.9%) of the csf samples yielded bacterial isolates: streptococcus pneumonia, 3 (4.5%); haemophilus influenza, 8 (11.9%); hemophilus spp, 1 (1.5%); e. coli, 1 (1.5%); and atypical coliform, 1 (1.5%). gram-negative  coliform isolates were predominantly resistant to penicillin based antibiotics and co-trimoxazole but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones. a high percentage of s. aureus isolates were multi-drug resistant. conclusions: bacterial infections contribute to the significant morbidity among children in our environment. s. aureus was more frequently isolated in sepsis while h. influenzae appears to play a major role in meningitis. appropriate use of antibiotics is needed to manage affected children effectively. we also recommend improved vaccine coverage of children under the age of five years.

TI  == [evaluation of effectiveness and tolerance of treatment with azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  == introduction: azithromycin is a macrolide class antibiotic, recently adapted for  topical use in ophthalmology. it is effective against the most frequent pathogens found in bacterial conjunctivitis, gram positive and gram negative bacteria. azithromycin has the specificity to have sustained high tissue levels: after repeated instillation, it has been shown to reach sustained concentrations above  the mics of susceptible bacteria for 4 days in tears and for 7 days in conjunctiva. the aim of study: to investigate the effectiveness and tolerance of  treatment with azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in bacterial conjunctivitis. materials and methods: the prospective study included 40 patients (69 eyes) with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis; aged 21-70 years; average: 38.05 patients were treated  with 1.5% azithromycin eye drops topically twice-daily for 3 days. conjunctival swabbings were taken at the 1st and the 7th +/- 1 day of the treatment. effectiveness and tolerance of eye drops were assessed in 7th +/- 1 day from the  beginning of the treatment. results: bacteriological cultures were positive before treatment in 34 eyes (49.28%), negative--35 eyes (50.72%). in 69 eyes with bacterial conjunctivitis the following microorganisms were identyfied (34 eyes):  streptococcus pneumoniae 23.53% (8 eyes), staphyllococcus aureus 23.53% (8 eyes), staphyllococcus epidermidis 20.59% (7 eyes), haemophilus influenzae 17.65% (6 eyes), morganella morgani 2.94% (1 eye), proteus mirabilis 2.94% (1 eye), enterococcus species 2.94% (1 eye), streptococcus viridians 2.94% (1 eye), moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis 2.94% (1 eye). positive bacteriological culture at the 7th day of treatment--2 eyes (1 eye--staphyllococcus epidermidis mscns, 1 eye--morganella morgani). clinical recovery or significant improvement were observed in 68 of 69 evaluated eyes. conclusions: three-day topical therapy  with azithromycin 1.5% eye drops is an effective and well tolerated therapy for purulent bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  == identification of an inhibitor of the murc enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  == the pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor udp-n-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. this pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the mur enzymes. in the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of  the escherichia coli murc (udp-n-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase), the first  of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. inhibition of atp consumed during the murc reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. after nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, c-1 emerged as a compound for further  characterization. the inhibition of murc by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. c-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the e. coli murc reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of atp binding to the murc enzyme. further work with murc enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting murc from genera (proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to e. coli,  murc enzymes from more distant gram-negative species such as haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baylyi, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.

TI  == the clinical development and launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment  of a range of community-acquired infections.
AB  == by the 1960s and 1970s, problems in the antibacterial treatment of infections had begun to emerge. previously active antibacterials were being compromised by the development of resistance. beta-lactamase production was identified in isolates of staphylococci, and, amongst others, in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. the discovery of the potent beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, and its protective effect on amoxicillin, a semi-synthetic penicillin with good oral absorption and potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, was thus of great importance in the treatment of bacterial disease. following preliminary clinical studies in bronchitis and urinary tract infections, amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was investigated in a wide range of infections and proved to demonstrate a high level of clinical efficacy. these results supported the launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate (augmentin) in 1981 for use in upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and obstetric, gynaecological and intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (actichelated propolis).
AB  == aims: this study compared in vitro activities of actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. methods and results: minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater  potency of actichelated propolis (mic range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (mic range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). concentrations of actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. preincubation of strep. pyogenes and h. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x mic) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. conclusions: actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells.  significance and impact of the study: this new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates from primary care clinics to oral antibacterial agents].
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates from specimens of patients  in primary care clinics in 2005 was investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations of oral antibacterial agents. the numbers of test strains were 550 for gram-positive aerobes, 700 for gram-negative aerobes, and 150 for anaerobes. cefcapene (cfpn), cefditoren (cdtr), and cefteram (cftm) showed the most potent activities against staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. among the cephems tested and moxifloxacin (mflx) and tosufloxacin among the  new quinolones. although the new quinolones generally showed potent activities against these species, resistant strains were frequently detected in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. in addition, 70% or more of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were intermediate or resistant to macrolides. cephems showed good activities against aerobic gram-negative bacteria except for  proteus spp. specifically, cfpn, cdtr, and cftm showed the most potent activity against haemophilus influenzae among the cephems tested. the new quinolones showed potent activities against gram-negative bacteria, especially h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not against proteus mirabilis and providencia spp. when compared with the susceptibilities of clinical isolates from tertiary care hospitals, found in other research, differences were noted, for example, there was a lower frequency of quinolone-resistant strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus but a higher frequency of macrolide-resistant strains of streptococcus  pyogenes. therefore, to accurately grasp susceptibility trends, well-focused surveillance studies are necessary.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

AB  == objective: to compare bact/alert (bta) and bactec 9240 (bac), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. materials and methods:  blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented bta and bac standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. the time to growth detection (td) was recorded for each bottle that became positive.  a quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess td of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. results: a total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both bta and bac bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by bta bottles and 13 (56.5%) by bac. proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the bta system. the average tds were 19.0 and 24.6 h for bta and bac, respectively. analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same  for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa but slightly different for haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. the anaerobic  bottle ofthe bta did not support the growth of h. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) cfu/ml whereas the bac did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml. td for  s. pneumoniae in the bta was about half of that in the bac. conclusions: the bta  system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the bac system to detect the same organism.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == the family of serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. the available bacterial genome sequences reveal serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. however, only s. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. this family of toxins has nothing in  common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins. the s. marcescens  hemolysin proteins shlb and shla, exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus  mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, yersinia pestis, yersinia enterocolitica, edwardsiella tarda, photorhabdus luminescens and xylella fastidiosa . the family  of serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has  been described as a two partner secretion system (tpss) or type v-secretion system. not only serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via tpss but also adhesins from bordetella pertussis, erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. the uniqueness of the serratia family is underlined by the fact that  activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. and, quite unusual, shla undergoes a conformational change during activation.

AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period november 2001-march 2002. out of 418 enterobacteriaceae included in the study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. esbls putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of proteus mirabilis and 25% escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as esbls producers notably p.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for esbl producers. esbls producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. the isolates considered as amp c beta lactamase putative producers  showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. noteworthy only 4% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mic(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against acinetobacter spp (mic(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). only 41.7% acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of haemophilus influenzae isolates (mic(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but  only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as e.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 e.faecium and 1 e.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. all the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed mics of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. among 34 viridans group streptococci only  67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (mic(90) 4 microg/ml).piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial  drug to be used, preferably in combination (ie: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in argentina. caution must be taken for infections due to esbl producers considering that the inoculum effect mics can affect mic values.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == role of rsma in the regulation of swarming motility and virulence factor expression in proteus mirabilis.
AB  == swarming by proteus mirabilis involves differentiation of typical short vegetative rods into filamentous hyper-flagellated swarm cells that undergo cycles of rapid and co-ordinated population migration across surfaces and exhibit high levels of virulence gene expression. rsma (repressor of secondary metabolites) and csra, its homologue in escherichia coli, control many phenotypic traits, such as motility and pathogenesis in erwinia species, glycogen biosynthesis, cell size and biofilm formation in escherichia coli and swarming motility in serratia marcescens. to investigate the role of rsma in proteus mirabilis, the rsma gene from proteus mirabilis (hereafter referred to as rsma(pm)) was cloned. rsma(pm) showed high sequence similarity to escherichia coli csra and rsma cloned from erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae and bacillus subtilis and could complement an  escherichia coli csra mutant in glycogen synthesis. a low-copy-number plasmid carrying rsma(pm) expressed from its native promoter caused suppression of swarming motility and expression of virulence factors in proteus mirabilis. mrna  stability assays suggested that rsma(pm) inhibited virulence factor expression through promoting mrna degradation. rsma homologues cloned from serratia marcescens and erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora could also inhibit swarming and virulence factor expression in proteus mirabilis.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

AB  == the incidence of acute otitis media (aom) in a comprehensive healthcare setting was investigated in ile-ife, nigeria. out of the 617 children examined, 53 (11.64 per cent) suffered from the condition based on the criteria used. staphylococci constituted the predominant organisms associated with the condition with staphylococcus aureus (25.0 per cent) being the most frequent single microbe recovered from the subjects. this was followed by proteus mirabilis (16.2 per cent), staphylococcus sp. (8.8 per cent), streptococcus pneumoniae (8.8 per cent), pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae (7.4 per cent each). most isolates tested were multiply resistant to the antibiotics commonly employed in treating infections caused by these organisms. the study highlights the prevalence of multi-resistant organisms amongst the subjects and recommends prompt therapeutic intervention to avert ineffectiveness of antibiotics when used in treating infections caused by these organisms in the community.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  == background: ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (oe), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (aom-tt) and chronic suppurative otitis media (csom). the quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. methods: a survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of  quinolone otic products for oe, aom-tt and csom. results: oe: floxin otic and cortisporin tc otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. csom: ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter spp.  aom-tt: ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa conclusions: in each of the studies of oe, csom and aom-tt, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to cortisporin for children with oe; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with aom-tt who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients  with csom.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  == although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. it has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (ccf) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (doc) subjects (pii 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). while no subjects in the doc group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the ccf subjects were found to be colonized. oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in ccf subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and higher plaque scores. these results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of copd may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

AB  == the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. a total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth  or agar dilution methods. among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 microg/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 microg/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a mic90 of 8 and > 8 microg/ml for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. all enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of gar-936 (mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/ml). although gar-936 (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was two-fold less active than minocycline (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 2 microg/ml) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 microg/ml). haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 1-2 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml), and various neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.12-0.5 microg/ml) were susceptible to gar-936. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to gar-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  == in adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus agalactiae. in rare cases the cause of infection may also be pneumococcus and haemophilus influenzae. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of  urinary infections. method of the study: we isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the university children's hospital in belgrade. urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking  the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by uricult test. the samples  were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. identification was done by standard  bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious api-20e (biomerieux) was used. bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on muller-hinton agars. results: based on the obtained results, escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to  co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). discussion: it may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. however, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by escherichia coli. natural resistance to ampicillin of klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. contrary to proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus and providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics,  ampicillin was widely used. the wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. a fall in the sensitivity of klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole,  which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant klebsiella species. the sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). the most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes

TI  == airways microbial flora in copd patients in stable clinical conditions and during exacerbations: a bronchoscopic investigation.
AB  == patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) undergo frequent exacerbations of their illness characterized by increased cough and expectoration. the precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. in  the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. thus, we performed  fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (psb) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with copd, 16 with stable  clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. the aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with copd exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) colony forming units.ml-1). the predominant bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aerococcus viridans and chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). although significant  bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.

(4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == the periplasmic, group iii catalase of vibrio fischeri is required for normal symbiotic competence and is induced both by oxidative stress and by approach to stationary phase.
AB  == the catalase gene, kata, of the sepiolid squid symbiont vibrio fischeri has been  cloned and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence of kata has a high degree of similarity to the recently defined group iii catalases, including those found  in haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and proteus mirabilis. upstream  of the predicted start codon of kata is a sequence that closely matches the consensus sequence for promoters regulated in escherichia coli by the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpos. further, the level of expression of the cloned kata gene in an e. coli rpos mutant is much lower than in wild-type e. coli. catalase  activity is induced three- to fourfold both as growing v. fischeri cells approach stationary phase and upon the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide during logarithmic growth. the catalase activity was localized in the periplasm of wild-type v. fischeri cells, where its role could be to detoxify hydrogen peroxide coming from the external environment. no significant catalase activity could be detected in a kata null mutant strain, demonstrating that kata is the predominately expressed catalase in v. fischeri and indicating that v. fischeri carries only a single catalase gene. the catalase mutant was defective in its ability to competitively colonize the light organs of juvenile squids in coinoculation experiments with the parent strain, suggesting that the catalase enzyme plays an important role in the symbiosis between v. fischeri and its squid host.

TI  == ciprofloxacin versus cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis.
AB  == objective: this study compared the use and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to cefuroxime axetil for adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. method: we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily)  for 2 to 3 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of  acute bacterial maxillary sinus infections or acute exacerbation of chronic bacterial sinusitis. patients with microbiologically and radiologically confirmed sinusitis infection composed the efficacy population. results: of the 83 patients enrolled, 13 of 42 (31%) ciprofloxacin- and 19 of 41 (46%) cefuroxime axetil-treated patients had a respiratory pathogen isolated from a sinus aspiration. the most frequent pretherapy isolated included haemophilus influenzae (11), streptococcus species (20), staphylococcus species (7), proteus mirabilis (3), and neisseria sicca (3). at the end of therapy, clinical resolution or improvement in efficacy-valid patients was achieved in 12 (100%) ciprofloxacin-treated patients and in 14 (74%) cefuroxime axetil recipients. the  five (26%) cefuroxime axetil clinical failures were due to development of superinfection. bacteriologic eradication occurred in 12 (100%) and 14 (100%) ciprofloxacin and cefuroxime axetil patients, respectively. similar clinical and  bacteriologic response rates were observed at the 2- to 4-week follow-up. among 83 intent-to-treat patients, 19 (45%) ciprofloxacin and 14 (34%) cefuroxime axetil patients had drug-related adverse events. the most common adverse event in both treatment groups was gastrointestinal. conclusion: this pilot study suggests that ciprofloxacin is efficacious in the management of acute bacterial sinusitis.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == a human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  == it is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. this study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with  acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection  from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. our study revealed the following: (a) suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. of these 20  bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. this staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. this finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing snhl by therapeutic intervention. spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing  loss in addition to the cochlea. this subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) it has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent snhl is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible snhl is caused by serous labyrinthitis. our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) the data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) there were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with  the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. a notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the  rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

AB  == toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in  murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five mediterranean countries.
AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == genes encoding high-molecular-weight adhesion proteins of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae are part of gene clusters.
AB  == we previously reported the cloning and sequencing of genes designated hmw1 and hmw2 from a prototype nontypeable haemophilus influenzae strain. the genes encode proteins which are related to filamentous hemagglutinin of bordetella pertussis and promote attachment of the nontypeable h. influenzae strain to human epithelial cells (j. w. st. geme iii, s. falkow, and s. j. barenkamp, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 90:2875-2879, 1993). subcloning studies suggested that correct processing of these high-molecular-weight proteins required the products of additional downstream genes. in the present study we analyzed the 3'-flanking regions of the hmw1a and hmw2a structural genes and found that both genes are flanked by two additional downstream open reading frames (orfs), designated b and c, respectively. the b orfs are 1,635 bp long. their derived amino acid sequences are 99% identical and demonstrate similarity to the derived amino acid sequences  of two genes that encode proteins required for secretion and activation of hemolysins of proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens. the c orfs are 1,950 bp  long, and their derived amino acid sequences are 96% identical. in escherichia coli transformants, interruption of the hmw1c or both the hmw1b and hmw1c genes resulted in defective processing of the hmw1a structural gene product and loss of the ability of the transformants to adhere to human epithelial cells. the precise interactions of the proteins encoded by these gene clusters are yet to be defined, but their elucidation may further our understanding of the biology of nontypeable h. influenzae bacteria and the interaction of these organisms with the human host.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

TI  == pneumonia in the elderly. special considerations in a special population.
AB  == bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract in the elderly may not be as  atypical in presentation as traditional wisdom once held. recent studies indicate that more than one in three elderly patients have fever, cough, and leukocytosis; nevertheless, some elderly patients present with none of the features typically associated with pneumonia. an important and consistent clinical difference between younger and older patients is the broader range of bacterial respiratory  pathogens found in the elderly, including gram-negative bacilli such as haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, and moraxella catarrhalis. little is gained by the initial use of narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and much may be  lost. parenteral third-generation cephalosporins and oral fluoroquinolones are active against the major pathogens and can be used for empirical broad-spectrum therapy. recent trials indicate that results are equally good with agents of either type. perhaps a third of elderly patients with pneumonia do not require or benefit from hospitalization. the availability of excellent new broad-spectrum oral antimicrobial agents makes treatment at home or in a nursing home an attractive way to avoid the costs and many complications of hospitalization for acute care of these frail patients.

AB  == in order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of cdzm and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide  medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. the followings are a summary of the results: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter diversus, most of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. some strains of klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant escherichia coli seemed likely. among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including cdzm and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. mic90's of cdzm against streptococcus spp., h. infleunzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp. and p. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. this indicates that cdzm would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. however, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant s. pneumoniae, cephem resistant e. coli and cephem resistant k. oxytoca with cdzm. 3. among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of cdzm with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. antibacterial activities of cdzm we observed in this study seem to indicate that  cdzm concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above mic levels for relatively long periods of time.

TI  == [the antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  == in order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (cftm), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from july 1990 to june 1991 and from july 1992 to february 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. the obtained results are summarized below. 1. no cftm-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. it appeared that streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of escherichia coli were increasing. the former included benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae  (pisp) of pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. the mic's of beta-lactams against the above pisp or prsp, and against cephems-resistant e. coli tended to be high, but those  of cftm were relatively low (in most cases). 3. proportions of strains resistant  to cephems, including cftm among citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and providencia rettgeri were  high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. as mentioned above, cftm is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of mic90's, and as far as mic80's are concerned, cftm still is as active  as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == [a nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in japan (1988-1990)].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == the penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  == we examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. we obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. these vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and haemophilus influenzae, as well as the mic70 of s. aureus and bacillus cereus. therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.

TI  == loracarbef. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  == loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. at low concentrations (< 2 mg/l) in vitro, it inhibits streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups b, c and g. proteus mirabilis and moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. at therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus,  escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of haemophilus influenzae. like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. when administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. it is administered twice daily. it offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == in a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. a total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. all were included in the safety analysis. clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18  (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. one haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. persisting organisms with amoxicillin included haemophilus influenzae (four), haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), escherichia coli (two), streptococcus pneumoniae (one), neisseria species (one), and proteus  mirabilis (one). adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. fleroxacin may be indicated for  the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due  to haemophilus species and moraxella catarrhalis. the 92% incidence of resistance among the s. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  == parameters characterizing the in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, against respiratory and urinary pathogens.
AB  == the wide and potent in vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral broad spectrum cephalosporin, has been confirmed on a collection of respiratory and urinary pathogens recently isolated in italy. the new cephem emerged as the most bactericidal of all the comparators tested against several fast as well as slowly-growing gram-negative species including enterobacteria, haemophilus and moraxella, irrespective of their ability to synthetize beta-lactamases. among the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were effectively covered. cefixime activity was not adversely influenced by several important variables such as ph (over the range from 5 to 8), inoculum size (from 10(5) to 10(8) cfu per ml) and the presence of 50% human serum or urine. time-kill tests confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of the drug especially towards common respiratory pathogens (h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes). killing of urinary strains was optimal at cefixime concentrations reached in urine since eradication, except for proteus mirabilis, was enhanced with increasing levels of the drug. the absence of an untoward paradoxic effect on the rate of cefixime bactericidal action was confirmed by employing a dynamic  bladder model simulating the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single 200 mg daily dosage. interactions of cefixime with several other drugs that may be employed in combination therapy were generally prone to provide indifference and synergism while antagonism was never observed. favorable interactions were also registered when cefixime acted with other antibiotics on partially resistant species such as staphylococci and pseudomonas. the new cephem seems to provide excellent opportunities for expanding oral cephalosporin therapy to a wide range of infections produced by susceptible pathogens in the adult and  pediatric populations.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the investigational oral and parenteral cephalosporin bk-218.
AB  == bk-218 is a novel cephalosporin with a dual route of administration and spectrum  of activity most similar to that of second-generation cephalosporins. bk-218 was  active against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but strains resistant to penicillins had higher mics. bk-218 had greater activity (8-fold) than cefuroxime or cefaclor against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp. moderate bk-218 activity was observed against neisseria gonorrhoeae and commonly isolated enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli (mic90, 1 mg/l), klebsiella spp. (mic90, 2 mg/l), and proteus mirabilis (mic90, 2 mg/l). the following organisms were generally bk-218-resistant (mic90, greater than 16 mg/l): bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., indole-positive proteus, serratia spp., enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.

TI  == comparative activity of meropenem (sm-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  == meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus  influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. for nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower mic90 values compared to imipenem against strains of serratia marcescens, enterobacter  cloacae and escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against proteus mirabilis isolates. activity was similar to that of imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.

AB  == we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1989. the susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and xanthomonas maltophilia. ipm has been found to have activities  superior to those of other antibiotics tested against e. faecalis, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis. no antibiotics tested showed good activities against mrsa except minocycline.

TI  == long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == in most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (bm) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. the search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. in this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of bm was done in two hospitals in mali and niger, between march, 1989, and may, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48  h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). the cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the  chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). no outbreak occurred during the study period. the hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. the case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133)  for haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for streptococcus pneumoniae. in a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference  between treatment groups. our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for bm in high-incidence countries.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities  to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (uti). patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. patients with uti were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. for patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, acinetobacter species, and k. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. infections by enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. for uti patients, e. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. all 14 uti patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. in the  ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by enterococcus species, and  in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by enterococcus species and one by enterobacter cloacae. intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil in a pharmacokinetic in-vitro model.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. strains of klebsiella spp. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. while for esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. the lower doses showed stepwise lower activities.  apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like shv 2 or tem 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in esch. coli and h. influenzae did not affect the  antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. the results show that cefpodoxime was more active against gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.

TI  == receptors for human plasminogen on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a total of 188 strains representing 11 species of gram-negative bacteria were examined for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. highly purified human plasminogen was labeled with 125i, and its uptake by different bacterial strains was measured. all 14 strains of haemophilus influenzae and all 13 strains of branhamella catarrhalis tested were positive with respect to plasminogen uptake. also, eight species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae were tested, and of those, proteus mirabilis demonstrated the most substantial uptake, with 28 of 39 strains taking up more than 10% of the plasminogen. ten strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested, of which seven showed uptake values higher than 10%. with h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis strains, scatchard analysis indicated a two-phase receptor interaction, one more-avid receptor with  a kd of 6 to 8 nm and 2,000 to 2,500 sites per bacterium and a second receptor with a kd of 50 to 80 nm and 9,000 sites per bacterium. with pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, a single receptor interaction was detected with a kd of 60 nm and the number of sites was estimated as 8,000 per bacterium. scatchard analysis  with strains of p. mirabilis indicated binding of a less-specific nature. however, plasminogen uptake by this species could be reduced by 50% by the addition of 2 mm unlabeled plasminogen. this estimate of kd, as well as uptake studies with plasminogen fragments, suggests different properties of this receptor. with all receptor types, the addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex inhibited plasminogen uptake, which demonstrates that both forms of the molecule  react with the same receptors. plasminogen uptake could be eliminated by the addition of lysine or epsilon-aminocaproic acid, which suggests that the lysine-binding sites of the plasminogen molecule are involved in the receptor-ligand interaction.

TI  == intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in serious infections. a prospective, controlled clinical trial with third-party blinding.
AB  == oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections  due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. the efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with that of intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of 59 patients with well-documented serious infections in a prospective, controlled, randomized study with a third-party blinding. thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours, plus a daily extra placebo dose); 26 patients were treated with ceftazidime (1 g every eight hours). the severity of the infections, underlying diseases, and demographic features were comparable in both groups, although there were more men in the ciprofloxacin group. for ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime treatments, respectively, the evaluated infections were: pyelonephritis (16 patients/nine patients), pneumonia (three/five), soft-tissue infections (four/zero), spontaneous peritonitis (five/two), primary bacteremia (three/eight), and other (two/two). isolated pathogens included: escherichia coli (22/12), klebsiella sp. (five/four), pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), haemophilus influenzae (one/one), proteus mirabilis (two/zero), proteus vulgaris  (one/zero), salmonella sp. (zero/two), plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). the clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate,  two/one. the bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one.  mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. a mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). the results presented suggest  that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. an additional advantage seems to be  a lower rate of superinfections.

TI  == nonculture detection of haemophilus influenzae in sputum with monoclonal antibodies specific for outer membrane lipoprotein p6.
AB  == isolation of haemophilus influenzae from sputum is hampered by overgrowth by other microorganisms or by antibiotic treatment of the patient. to overcome this  problem in the detection of h. influenzae, an in situ immunoperoxidase staining technique was developed with monoclonal antibody (mab) 8bd9, immunoglobulin subclass g2a. mab 8bd9 appeared to be directed to an epitope on the outer membrane lipoprotein p6 of h. influenzae. the species specificity of mab 8bd9 was analyzed by staining isolates from different bacterial species. mab 8bd9 reacted  with all 300 h. influenzae strains tested and with h. aegyptius and h. haemolyticus. twenty-six of 30 h. parainfluenzae strains, other haemophilus species, and other bacterial species often isolated from sputum were not stained. the staining technique was compared with culture of 845 routinely obtained sputum samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. in 829 sputa (98.1%), the results of both techniques were in agreement; 173 were positive for h. influenzae, and 656 were negative. with 14 sputum samples, the staining method gave a positive result for h. influenzae, but the bacterium was not cultured. this could be ascribed to antibiotic treatment of the patient (n = 7), the presence of other mab 8bd9-positive haemophilus species in the sputum (n = 5), and overgrowth by swarming proteus mirabilis or by branhamella catarrhalis. in the immunoperoxidase- and gram-stained smears of two sputum samples, no bacteria  were seen, although some h. influenzae was cultured. on the basis of these results, we conclude that immunoperoxidase staining with mab 8bd9 is a fast and reliable extension of the available detection techniques for h. influenzae.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  == antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial  activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of  ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.

TI  == review of the in-vitro spectrum and characteristics of cefmetazole (cs-1170).
AB  == the in-vitro antimicrobial qualities of cefmetazole are summarized from a review  of over 30 publications. cefmetazole, a 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, is shown to have an antimicrobial spectrum closely resembling cefoxitin's. however, cefmetazole is approximately two- to eight-fold more active than cefoxitin against commonly isolated species such as escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, pyogenic streptococci, pneumococci, and haemophilus influenzae. cefmetazole is also active against anaerobic pathogens, neisseria spp., citrobacter diversus, indole-positive proteus spp. and branhamella catarrhalis. cefmetazole is bactericidal against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. its mics and mbcs are minimally influenced by high inoculum  concentrations. beta-lactamases failed to hydrolyze cefmetazole significantly and cefmetazole is considered the most stable of the cephamycin drugs. some bacteroides strains produce beta-lactamases that are uniquely inhibited by cefmetazole. in-vitro tests with cefmetazole have been evaluated and interpretive criteria established for nccls methods: susceptible greater than or equal to 18 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). the consistent cross-resistance and -susceptibility observed between cefmetazole and cefoxitin requires the testing of only one of these agents routinely. quality control guidelines for cefmetazole disc diffusion (30 micrograms disc) and dilution tests are summarized in this review.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

AB  == in vitro activities of cefuzonam (czon) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mic's and the results of disc susceptibility test. the mic's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)cfu/ml. the mic80's of czon against streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, haemophilus influenzae and citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. the mic80's against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. the mic80's against staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. approximately 70% of strains of s. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. for the interpretation of the czon showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa disc containing czon, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic less than 60 micrograms/ml. reliability of the czon  disc tests in estimating approximate mic values was studied using showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms czon. a good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters  and mic's, showing the reliability of the disc method. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately  classified into the 4 groups except those against p. aeruginosa. some strains of  p. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with mic's against these organisms. as czon is not effective against p. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between mic's and the disc test would result when p. aeruginosa was excluded. with showa  30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. in this study, however, it was  demonstrated that differentiation of strains with mic's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of czon were used. according to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including  penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding  of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in  the body.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of r-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a ch2och3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. r-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups a, b, c, f, and g) and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against branhamella spp. it did not inhibit (mic, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. the mics of r-3746 for 90% of strains tested for escherichia coli; klebsiella pneumoniae; citrobacter diversus; proteus mirabilis; and salmonella, shigella, and yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. it was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.  r-3746 inhibited 50% of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, morganella spp., providencia spp., proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. pseudomonas spp. were resistant. fifty percent of clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but mics for bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. r-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.

TI  == in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (sc-47111; ny-198), a difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acid, compared with those of other quinolones.
AB  == lomefloxacin (sc-47111; ny-198) is a new difluoroquinolone agent. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., shigella spp., aeromonas spp., yersinia spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against proteus spp., providencia spp., serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., and shigella spp. ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. lomefloxacin inhibited staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but mics for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml.  in the presence of 9 mm mg2+, mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. a single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the mic occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced mic increases. lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.

TI  == a survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  == ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the united states. data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. the unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. the  duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections  (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. in 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. after treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. of 411 isolates of p. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 escherichia coli and 80% of 248 staphylococcus aureus isolates. also eradicated were 95% of 166 klebsiella, 96% of 139 proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other proteus, 94% of 123 enterobacter, 100% of 68 haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 citrobacter, 89% of 45 serratia, 95% of 41 streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 salmonella, 100% of 38 morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 providencia isolates. adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. the most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated sgot, sgpt, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). crystalluria,  judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  == the authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (uti); 114 for respiratory tract infections (rti); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (bdi); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (ski); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. the following gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus group d; and the following gram-negative  organisms [122]: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, serratia  spp., klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the overall eradication rate for gram-positive organisms was 74% and for gram-negative organisms it was 88%. the clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of uti, 84.2% of  rti, 97.5% of bdi and 82.3% of ski). the drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. in conclusion, cefotetan  appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  == cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. it  inhibits the majority, 90%, of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes,  branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it inhibits 90% of the other members of the  enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii, cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, listeria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. in general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.

TI  == cephalosporin, carbapenem, and monobactam antibiotics.
AB  == cephalosporin and related antibiotics are highly effective bactericidal agents of relatively low toxicity. the spectrum of activity varies with the drug but is usually broad. the first-generation cephalosporins, and especially cefazolin, are most active against sensitive staphylococci and streptococci. most second-generation (except cefoxitin) and third-generation cephalosporins show substantial activity against haemophilus influenzae. all cephalosporins (except cefsulodin) are active against klebsiella, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, whereas only the third-generation agents have pronounced activity against the other enterobacteriaceae. imipenem (a carbapenem) is active against essentially all pathogenic organisms, but aztreonam (a monobactam) is active against only aerobic gram-negative bacilli. advantages associated with some of the new cephalosporins are once-daily administration and high cerebrospinal fluid levels. with the development of new cephalosporins, however, new toxicities have  become apparent, and superinfections and induction of resistance have become greater problems. the cephalosporins are among the most expensive antibiotics in  use today; thus, use of these expensive agents must be justified by lower toxicity, greater efficacy, or both in comparison with drugs of more reasonable cost.

AB  == using antisera raised against serotype 2 and 3 fimbrial subunits from bordetella  pertussis, serologically related polypeptides were detected in bordetella bronchiseptica, bordetella parapertussis and bordetella avium strains. the two b. pertussis fimbrial subunits, and three of the serologically related b. bronchiseptica polypeptides, were shown to be very similar in amino acid composition and n-terminal amino acid sequence. homology was observed between the n-termini of these polypeptides, and fimbrial subunits from escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis. a synthetic oligonucleotide probe,  derived from the n-terminal sequence of the b. pertussis serotype 2 fimbrial subunit, was used to identify fimbrial genes in genomic southern blots. the results suggested the presence of multiple fimbrial subunit genes in b. pertussis, b. bronchiseptica and b. parapertussis. the dna probe was used to clone one of the three tentative fimbrial subunit genes detected in b. pertussis.

AB  == in a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, strep. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, hemophilus influenzae, and proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. all clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. the gram-positive  isolates bound concanavalin a, while the gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. streptococcal species isolates reacted with dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. lectins may be useful  in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.

TI  == oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the columbia-presbyterian medical center, new york, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had  significant underlying disease. there were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. the pathogens were: escherichia coli, 7 (mean mic 0.07 mg/l); serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of acinetobacter anitratus. haemophilus, influenzae, salmonella enteritidis, flavobacterium meningosepticum, and streptococcus faecalis. of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70%  to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to  cotrimoxazole. ten patients had concomitant ps. aeruginosa infections. patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. the overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if  ps. aeruginosa is included. resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one staph. aureus and one ser. marcescens (mic greater than 2 mg/l). toxicity was minor. ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.

AB  == ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and  streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates,  were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == acute mastoiditis. influence of antibiotic treatment on the bacterial spectrum.
AB  == the work was undertaken to investigate the spectrum of bacteria responsible for acute mastoiditis and to find out whether it is affected by intake of antibiotics prior to surgical treatment. the records were reviewed of 22 children with acute  mastoiditis in whom mastoidectomy had been performed and bacterial cultures obtained. eleven of the patients had had antibiotic treatment prior to admission  (9 penicillin v and 2 erythromycin). streptococcus pneumoniae was found in 8 of the purulent discharges: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus beta-hemolyticus and staphylococcus aureus in 2 each; proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas pyocyaneus and a bacteroides strain in 1 each, while five discharges-all from patients pretreated with antibiotics-yielded no growth. none of the 9 patients pretreated  with penicillin v provided pure cultures of pneumococci or beta-hemolytic streptococci, while one or the other of these species was found in 8 of the 11 untreated patients. gram-negative bacteria were found both among those with and those without antibiotic pretreatment. the data indicate that pneumococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci are more likely to cause mastoiditis than are the other pathogens found in acute otitis media, and that, when drained at operation, purulent discharges are often found to have been sterilized by the pre-operative  antibiotic treatment.

TI  == current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in hungary.
AB  == this survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by public health network laboratories in 1983. facultatively pathogenic gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. in contrast to other streptococci, all streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. the majority of the gram-positive  strains were resistant to tetracycline. a comparison to results reported earlier  (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. emergence of haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of p. mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. the increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. in some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. a restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. multiresistant gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a  representative clinical material. the frequent occurrence of multiresistant p. mirabilis and acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant e. coli strains was very low. amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

AB  == a comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin was carried out in 49 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. patients were randomly assigned to the treatment drug. clindamycin was given concomitantly until the pathogen was identified and the presence of a gram-positive microorganism was ruled out. samples of sputum were obtained for culture from the lung parenchyma by deep expectoration or transtracheal aspiration. a pathogen was defined as an organism that showed heavy growth and predominated in the culture. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis. a variety of less common pathogens were represented. thirty-five patients were treated with intravenous aztreonam (1-2 g every 8 hr) and 14 with intravenous tobramycin (3-5 mg/kg per day) until they were afebrile and sputum cultures had been free of the pathogen for 48 hr. the minimum duration of treatment was five days. in the aztreonam group, only two (5%) of the 37 gram-negative pathogens--one p. aeruginosa and one escherichia coli--persisted. in the tobramycin group, seven (50%) of the 14 pathogens persisted. clinical response paralleled microbiologic response. adverse effects in both treatment groups were  minor and transient. in this trial aztreonam was effective and safe for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by p. aeruginosa and a variety of other gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == the main use of the penicillins in orthopedic surgery is in the treatment of infections due to hemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group d streptococci (enterococci). penicillins have antimicrobial activity and have a characteristic pharmacodynamic action, including side effects. the tissue penetration characteristics of the penicillins into synovial fluid and human bone are significant. semisynthetic penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and the antipseudomonal penicillins are used for  treatment of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. oral penicillin therapy can be useful in treatment of osteomyelitis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fr 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fr 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group a and b streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. it was less active (mic, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit  streptococcus faecalis or listeria monocytogenes. fr 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. fr 17027 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, and citrobacter diversus at  less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. some strains of enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (mic, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). fr 17027 did not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas species, acinetobacter species, or bacteroides species. activity was  minimally affected by growth conditions. fr 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm =  mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the  following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3  to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.

AB  == fk 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as citrobacter and enterobacter species and serratia marcescens. fk 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative proteus species, providencia species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. with few exceptions, fk 027 was active against strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. the bactericidal activity of fk 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including proteus species, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, and s. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. the therapeutic activities of fk 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.

TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  == cefpiramide (cpm, sm-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. antibacterial activities of cpm against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis and proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (cpz). antibacterial activities of cpm against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of cpz, but antibacterial activity of  cpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of cpz and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. antibacterial activity of cpm has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (pcase type) producing s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, etc. it is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of cpm against pathogenic organisms but also the  beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of cpm.

TI  == evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of severe bacterial infection.
AB  == we investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages  ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. the clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones  were polymicrobial. significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: escherichia coli (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), pseudomonas cepacia (1), proteus mirabilis (5), serratia marcescens (2), klebsiella (2), enterobacter aerogenes (1) and haemophilus influenzae (1). total  dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). the overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by ps. aeruginosa.

AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ro 13-9904 against 245 clinical isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. the activity of ro 13-9904 against most enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of cefotaxime; it was slightly more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, providencia species, and serratia marcescens, but slightly less active against klebsiella species. ro 13-9904 was twofold more active than cefotaxime and threefold more active than ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean mic of 7.2 micrograms/ml; isolates highly resistant to ticarcillin were inhibited by a mean mic of 17.2 micrograms/ml. ro 13-9904 was fourfold more  active than ampicillin against susceptible haemophilus influenzae and was equally active against beta-lactamase-producing isolates. ro 13-9904 was highly active against pneumococci and moderately active (mic, 4 micrograms/ml) against staphylococcus aureus isolates, whether they were susceptible or resistant to penicillin g. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus and streptococcus faecalis were completely resistant to ro 13-9904 (mic, greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

TI  == evaluation of cefaclor.
AB  == the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, bacterial spectrum, clinical use,  dosage, adverse reactions, and dosage forms and cost of cefaclor are reviewed. cefaclor, a congener of cephalexin monohydrate, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic. it is well absorbed when given orally on an empty stomach; absorption is delayed by the presence of food. although metabolism may play a role in the disposition of cefaclor, elimination is primarily renal. cefaclor's spectrum of activity is similar to that of cefalexin, including a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; in particular, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and haemophilus influenzae are more susceptible to clinically achievable concentrations of cefaclor than cephalexin. cefaclor has been demonstrated to be effective against  beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae resistant to ampicillin, but further studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of this activity. efficacy of cefaclor has been demonstrated in urinary tract, upper and lower respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue infections in adults and children as  well as in pediatric otitis media. adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, are generally mild and occur in few patients. usual doses are 250-500 mg every eight hours in adults and 20--40 mg/kg/day in children, although this pediatric dose may be two low for otitis media. clinical superiority of cefaclor over less  expensive antibiotics has not been demonstrated.

TI  == a comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  == the sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter species, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. all bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. all strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. only non-identical strains were used. a tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. the results showed that all strains of h. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. the other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. cefoperazone had potent activity against ps. aeruginosa. differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  == the activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. variation in ph, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. in escherichia coli cefmenoxime  showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (pbp-3), followed by pbp-1 (1a and 1b). this affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. the high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by proteus mirabilis.

TI  == ro 13-9904, a long-acting broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == ro 13-9904, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was found to have high in vitro activity against enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria, including various isolates resistant to cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin.  it showed promising activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. although inhibitory  against staphylococcus aureus at concentrations readily achievable in plasma, it  was less potent against this pathogen than cefamandole, cefazolin, or cefuroxime. isolates of streptococcus faecalis were uniformly resistant to all the cephalosporins tested. ro 13-9904 was more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae, but less active against s. aureus. ro 13-9904 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases. its therapeutic efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice was equal to or slightly superior to that of cefotaxime and sce-1365 when the antibiotics were administered in repeated subcutaneous doses after bacterial challenge. cefoperazone, and particularly cefamandole nafate, cefazolin, and mezlocillin were less effective. although structurally related to  cefotaxime and sce-1365, ro 13-9904 was found to differ from them in one important respect, namely, in having a long duration of action; this was observed with single-dose treatment given before bacterial challenge. its broad spectrum of activity coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic properties make ro 13-9904 a promising compound for clinical studies.

AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == cefamandole treatment of pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  == the increasing incidence of pneumonia caused by h. influenza and the problem of beta lactamase production (18% of strains in recent reports) are important considerations in the therapy of pneumonia. an antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against  escherichia coli, proteus spp., enterobacter spp., and haemophilus influenzae. seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. organisms isolated were haemophilus influenzae in 6, e. coli in 3, proteus mirabilis in 2, klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. the serratia were  resistant (mic greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other mic's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. two patients died from their underlying disease. adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included sgot rises in 3 and rash in one. serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to  12.5 microgram/ml (trough). sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml. cefamandole appears to be an effective antibiotic for treatment of gram-negative  pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

AB  == the in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. when pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. the rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for e. coli, p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa, and klebsiella spp. increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. the effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. the isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, and enterococci. however, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for p. aeruginosa and enterococci.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  == inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the who-ics agar dilution technique. cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, haemophilus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. none of these cephalosporins was active against enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteeae, pseudomonas, or  bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == [studies on the distribution of thienylcarbenicillin in the human tissue].
AB  == thienylcarbenicillin is another semisynthetic penicillin with a wide range of antibacterial activity including most of gram-negative bacterias, even such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. to investigate penetration activities into bone and another tissues, 120 specimens of serum and 120 specimens of tissue were obtained from 20 patients, after i.v. injection of a single doses of 150 mg thienylcarbenicillin per kg body weight. the evaluation of concentration showed that thienylcarbenicillin was eliminated from serum in a half-life time of 77 minutes. the concentration varied in different tissues. maximal levels were found in musculature and in spongy bone. unexpected high concentrations were found in fascia and in cutis. the lowest concentration was found in subcutis and compact bone. the experimental doses of 150 mg/kg body weight was not enough to gain a sufficient therapeutical level in compact bone.

TI  == bactericidal activity and pharmacology of flucloxacillin.
AB  == flucloxacillin, a recent addition to the group of isoxazolyl penicillins, was studied in vitro and in normal volunteers. the bactericidal activity of the drug  against most strains of gram-positive bacteria including penicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was similar to that of oxacillin and approximately fourfold greater than that of cloxacillin. each of the three penicillins was administered  orally to a group of ten volunteers for eight days in a dose of 500 mg four times a day. the mean concentrations of flucloxacillin in the serum were two- to sixfold higher than those of the other two agents on the first, fourth and eighth days of therapy. the percentage of flucloxacillin bound by serum protein was 94.6 per cent; for cloxacillin and oxacillin the values were 93.5 and 91.5 per cent, respectively. using these data, the concentrations of free flucloxacillin in serum were found to be twice as high as those of cloxacillin and oxacillin. these findings suggest that, when administered orally, this new agent may offer some therapeutic advantage over oxacillin and cloxacillin.

TI  == trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in chronic bronchitis.
AB  == authenic tracheobronchial secretions/exudates (tbse) were aspirated under direct  vision via a sterile catheter passed through a fiberoptic bronchoscope from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by chronic bronchitis. tbse, saliva and blood were obtained during long-term administration  of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx) and were assayed for drug content. before and during treatment tbse were cultured qualitatively and quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas and viruses. treatment with tmp-smx was associated with a decrease in the recovery of hemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis; however, little effect was observed on the typically nonpathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of the upper respiratory tract. tmp  was found in saliva at concentrations greater than in serum. both tmp and smx entered tbse in absolute and relative concentrations sufficient to take advantage of the potential for synergy against susceptible microorganisms. patient tolerance of tmp-smx was generally good and several patients reported a decrease  in production of sputum during treatment.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.
