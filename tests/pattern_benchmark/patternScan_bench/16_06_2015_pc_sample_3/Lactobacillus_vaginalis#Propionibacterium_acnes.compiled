TI  - Comparisons of the bacterial flora in genital regions at non-pregnancy.
AB  - In the development of infectious diseases at non-pregnancy and at pregnancy, correlations between bacterial flora in the vagina and portio vaginalis and the ascending infections of those bacteria have recently been discussed. To clarify the cause of those infectious diseases, we studied the localization of microorganisms in genital regions. Patients undergone abdominal total hysterectomy (n = 172) were employed as subjects, and microorganisms isolated from 4 genital regions were studied. In addition, the preventive effect of cefmetazole (CMZ) against postoperative infections was analyzed in 479 cases including the hysterectomy cases mentioned above. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The isolation rate of microorganisms at non-pregnancy, from subjects of 30 to 69 years old, was 65.6% (82/125) in the vagina and portio vaginalis, 52.1% (25/48) in the cervical mucus, 7.3% (9/124) in the uterine cavity and 0% (0/47) in the ovarian surface. 2. Numbers of microorganisms isolated in each region were 99 strains in the vagina and portio vaginalis, 28 in the cervical mucus, 10 in the uterine cavity and none in the ovarian surface. Isolation of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria (60-89.3%) and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (7.1-30%) were varied in each region. Lactobacillus spp. (38 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (20 strains) and Propionibacterium acnes (10 strains) were isolated from vagina and portio vaginalis, and Lactobacillus spp. (17 strains) were the most often isolated bacteria from the cervical mucus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
