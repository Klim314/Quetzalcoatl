TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == dynamics and diversity of the 'atopobium cluster' in the human faecal microbiota, and phenotypic characterization of 'atopobium cluster' isolates.
AB  == this study monitored the dynamics and diversity of the human faecal 'atopobium cluster' over a 3-month period using a polyphasic approach. fresh faecal samples  were collected fortnightly from 13 healthy donors (six males and seven females) aged between 26 and 61 years. fish was used to enumerate total (eub338mix) and 'atopobium cluster' (ato291) bacteria, with counts ranging between 1.12x10(11) and 9.95x10(11), and 1.03x10(9) and 1.16x10(11) cells (g dry weight faeces)(-1),  respectively. the 'atopobium cluster' population represented 0.2-22 % of the total bacteria, with proportions donor-dependent. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) using 'atopobium cluster'-specific primers demonstrated faecal populations of these bacteria were relatively stable, with bands identified as collinsella aerofaciens, collinsella intestinalis/collinsella stercoris, collinsella tanakaei, coriobacteriaceae sp. peav3-3, eggerthella lenta, gordonibacter pamelaeae, olsenella profusa, olsenella uli and paraeggerthella hongkongensis in the dgge profiles of individuals. colony pcr was used to identify 'atopobium cluster' bacteria isolated from faeces (n = 224 isolates). 16s rrna gene sequence analysis of isolates demonstrated collinsella aerofaciens represented the predominant (88 % of isolates) member of the 'atopobium cluster' found in human faeces, being found in nine individuals. eggerthella lenta was identified in three individuals (3.6 % of isolates). isolates of collinsella tanakaei, an 'enorma' sp. and representatives of novel species belonging to the 'atopobium cluster' were also identified in the study. phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrated their highly saccharolytic nature and heterogeneous phenotypic profiles, and 97 % of the isolates displayed lipase activity.

TI  == phylogenetic evidence for the transfer of eubacterium lentum to the genus eggerthella as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == eubacterium lentum has unique phenotypic characters within the genus eubacterium. the 16s rrna sequence of eubacterium lentum was determined and its phylogenetic position was defined. this micro-organism is a member of the genus eubacterium but it is not closely related to eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus eubacterium, and is nearer to collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans. a pcr-based identification system using species-specific primers designed on the basis of dna sequences encoding the 16s rrna of strains of eubacterium lentum, collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans is described. a species-specific primer set can distinguish eubacterium lentum from  eubacterium limosum or closely related species including collinsella aerofaciens, coriobacterium glomerans and atopobium species. this species-specific pcr method  can be used to identify eubacterium lentum-like species isolated from human faeces. on the basis of the 16s rrna sequence divergence from collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans and the presence of unique phenotypic characters, a new genus, eggerthella gen. nov., is proposed for eubacterium lentum, with one species, eggerthella lenta comb. nov. the type strain of eggerthella lenta is jcm 9979t.
