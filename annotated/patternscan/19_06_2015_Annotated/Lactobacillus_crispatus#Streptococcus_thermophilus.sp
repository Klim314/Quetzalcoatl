TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == the potential of a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production: bias of  culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
