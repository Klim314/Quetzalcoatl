TI == periodontal infection and its putative links with alzheimer's disease.
AB == periodontal disease (pd) and alzheimer's disease (ad) are inflammatory conditions affecting the global adult population. in the pathogenesis of pd, subgingival complex bacterial biofilm induces inflammation that leads to connective tissue degradation and alveolar bone resorption around the teeth. in health, junctional epithelium seals the gingiva to the tooth enamel, thus preventing bacteria from entering the gingivae. chronic pd involves major pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) which have an immune armoury that can circumvent host's immune surveillance to create and maintain an inflammatory mediator rich and toxic environment to grow and survive. the neurodegenerative condition, ad, is characterised by poor memory and specific hallmark proteins; periodontal pathogens are increasingly being linked with this dementing condition. it is therefore becoming important to understand associations of periodontitis with relevance to late-onset ad. the aim of this review is to discuss the relevance of finding the keystone periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis in ad brains and its plausible contribution to the aetiological hypothesis of this dementing condition.

TI == evaluation of a hydrophobic gel adhering to the gingiva in comparison with a standard water-soluble 1% chlorhexidine gel after scaling and root planing in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB == objectives: to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic activity of a hydrophobic chlorhexidine-based gingiva-adhering gel containing herbal ingredients, compared with a commercially available 1% chlorhexidine water-soluble gel, during non-surgical therapy of moderate chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 34 subjects participated in this 6-month blinded randomized parallel controlled trial (isrctn35210084). after scaling and root planing (srp), test group received the gel, by rubbing on the gingiva, once every second day, for 14 days. the control group received the control gel twice daily. clinical parameters considered were the approximal plaque index, simplified oral hygiene index, modified gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level (primary outcome), assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, together with the frequency of detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola (t.d.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.), and activity of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase (secondary outcomes). results: at 3 and 6 months, all clinical parameters improved significantly, without significant intergroup differences, except ohi-s, which improved at 3 months (p < 0.05). microbiological data resulted in no significant intergroup differences at baseline and 6 months. at 3 months, significant differences for p.g., t.f. and t.d. were noted. a significant reduction of neutrophil elastase after 3 and 6 months was observed (p < 0.005), without significant intergroup differences. for myeloperoxidase, significant reductions were noted in both groups (p < 0.005 and p < 0.05), but no significant intergroup differences. the tested product seemed to have an increased efficacy, due to longer persistence on the gingiva, with reduced application frequency. conclusions: both products had a relatively similar influence on the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic outcomes at 3 and 6 months after srp.

TI == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI == microbiome profiles in periodontitis in relation to host and disease characteristics.
AB == periodontitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the supporting tissues surrounding teeth. the occurrence of periodontitis is associated with shifts in the structure of the communities that inhabit the gingival sulcus. although great inter-subject variability in the subgingival microbiome has been observed in subjects with periodontitis, it is unclear whether distinct community types exist and if differences in microbial signatures correlate with host characteristics or with the variable clinical presentations of periodontitis. therefore, in this study we explored the existence of different community types in periodontitis and their relationship with host demographic, medical and disease-related clinical characteristics. clustering analyses of microbial abundance profiles suggested two types of communities (a and b) existed in the 34 subjects with periodontitis evaluated. type b communities harbored greater proportions of certain periodontitis-associated taxa, including species historically associated with the disease, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola, and taxa recently linked to periodontitis. in contrast, subjects with type a communities had increased proportions of different periodontitis-associated species, and were also enriched for health-associated species and core taxa (those equally prevalent in health and periodontitis). periodontitis subgingival clusters were not associated with demographic, medical or disease-specific clinical parameters other than periodontitis extent (proportion of sites affected), which positively correlated with the total proportion of cluster b signature taxa. in conclusion, two types of microbial communities were detected in subjects with periodontitis. host demographics and underlying medical conditions did not correlate with these profiles, which instead appeared to be related to periodontitis extent, with type b communities present in more widespread disease cases. the two identified periodontitis profiles may represent distinct dysbiotic processes potentially requiring community-tailored therapeutic interventions.

TI == periodontal status and pathogenic bacteria after gastric bypass: a cohort study.
AB == aim: the aim this study was to evaluate the influence of gastric bypass surgery (gbs) on periodontal disease and quantify the periodontopathogenic bacteria in patients undergoing this surgery. material and methods: this prospective study was composed of 50 patients who underwent bariatric surgery and the data collection was performed in three periods pre-operative, 6 (6m) and 12 months (12m) postoperative. the oral clinical examination to assess periodontal disease; gingival fluid sample collection for quantification of the periodontopathogenic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia using q-pcr; body mass index (bmi) and for collection of the individual's health-related data from medical files. results: there was a significant reduction in serum c-reactive protein (crp) and glucose levels after surgery. the mean probing pocket depth (ppd) and clinical attachment level (cal) increased significantly in the postoperative period of 6 months (p = 0.001). in the same period, the amount of p. gingivalis increased (p = 0.028) and the other bacteria decreased slightly (p > 0.050). in the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. intermedia, a poor periodontal condition was observed. conclusion: the periodontal disease increased in severity and p. gingivalis increased after gbs. a systemic inflammation resolution due to bariatric surgery in obese subjects does not seem to affect the course of periodontal disease.

TI == functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. the current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. methods: metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and stable sites from periodontitis patients. community-wide expression profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing (illumina). sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented on the r package 'noiseqbio'. we summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology (go) orthology. results: gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid a and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. periodontal pathogens (tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different tonb-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and crispr-associated genes. surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. we detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. conclusions: we identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. our results suggest that the whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an increase in virulence that leads to progression. trial registration: nct01489839, 6 december 2011.

TI == full mouth periodontal debridement with or without adjunctive metronidazole gel in smoking patients with chronic periodontitis: a pilot study.
AB == background and objective: the evidence of effectiveness of metronidazole (mtz) as an adjunct therapy to periodontal procedure in the treatment of patients with chronic periodontitis is not conclusive. the aim of this study was to compare the effect of mtz (delivered locally as a gel or systemically as a tablet) as an adjunctive therapy with full mouth periodontal debridement (1 h of ultrasonic calculus/plaque removal) in smokers with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: this pilot study involved 30 smokers with at least six teeth with a clinical attachment loss of >/= 5 mm and probing pocket depth (ppd) of >/= 5 mm. they were randomly assigned into one of three groups (n = 10): (i) 3 g daily of placebo gel applied topically (using a dental tray with the gel overnight) + periodontal debridement; (ii) 3 g daily of a 15% mtz benzoate gel applied topically (using a dental tray with the gel overnight) + periodontal debridement; and (iii) a daily single dose of 750 mg mtz (flagyl(r) ) + periodontal debridement. clinical parameters (visible plaque index, gingival bleeding index [gbi], relative attachment level and ppd) and quantitative analysis (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 mo after periodontal debridement. results: there was no statistically significant difference in the average gbi and visible plaque index values at baseline between the groups (p >/= 0.05). there was no significant difference between groups in all parameters evaluated (p >/= 0.05). significant reductions in gbi at 3 and 6 mo were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). significant reductions in both ppd and relative attachment level at 1, 3 and 6 mo were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). significant reductions in bacterial levels at 7 and 30 d were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). conclusion: adjunctive use of mtz (gel or tablet) to periodontal debridement had similar clinical and microbiological improvement compared to treatment with placebo + periodontal debridement in smokers with chronic periodontitis up to 6 mo post-treatment. further studies are necessary to confirm the clinical relevance of these findings.

TI == bacterial profile of aggressive periodontitis in morocco: a cross-sectional study.
AB == background: aggressive periodontitis (agp) is one of the most severe forms of periodontal diseases. in morocco, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been strongly associated with agp, however limited knowledge is available about the implication of other periodontal pathogens in this entity. therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota in moroccan patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 aggressive, 13 localized and 37 generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 20 chronic periodontitis (chp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in pre-reduced transport fluid and examined by culture. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004) in generalised agp compared to chp, and porphyromonas gingivalis was less prevalent in localized agp, when compared with generalized agp (p = 0.040) or chp (p = 0.016). prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia were also frequently detected in all groups. mean proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in agp groups, when compared to chp, and generalized agp patients harbored significantly higher proportions of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, when compared to localized agp or chp. conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum were frequently detected in this moroccan population with agp. differences in frequency of detection, counts and proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. forsythia suggests the presence of distinct microbiological profiles for localized agp, generalized agp and chp patients.

TI == clinical, microbiological, and immunological aspects of healthy versus peri-implantitis tissue in full arch reconstruction patients: a prospective cross-sectional study.
AB == background: due to the world-wide increase in treatments involving implant placement, the incidence of peri-implant disease is increasing. late implant failure is the result of the inability to maintain osseointegration, whose most important cause is peri-implantitis. the aim of this study was to analyze the clinical, microbiological, and immunological aspects in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and patients with peri-implantitis. methods: pisf samples were obtained from 24 peri-implantitis sites and 54 healthy peri-implant sites in this prospective cross-sectional study. the clinical parameters recorded were: modified gingival index (mgi), modified plaque index (mpi) and probing pocket depth (ppd). the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl). pisf samples were analyzed for the quantification of interleukin (il)-8, il-1beta, il-6, il-10 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha using flow cytometry (facs). results: the mgi and ppd scores in the peri-implantitis group were significantly higher than the healthy group (p < 0.001). a total of 61.5% of the patients with peri-implantitis had both arches rehabilitated, compared with 22.7% of patients with healthy peri-implant tissues; there was no implant with peri-implantitis in cases that received mandibular treatment exclusively (p < 0.05). concentrations of porphyromonas gingivalis (p < 0.01), association with bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola (p < 0.05), as well as the tbl (p < 0.05) are significantly higher in the peri-implantitis group. il-1beta (p < 0.01), il-6 (p < 0.01), il-10 (p < 0.05) and tnf-alpha (p < 0.01) are significantly higher at the sites with peri-implantitis compared to healthy peri-implant tissue, while il-8 did not increase significantly. conclusion: the results of the present study involving a limited patient sample suggest that the peri-implant microbiota and which dental arch was rehabilitated involved could contribute to bone loss in peri-implantitis. a significant relationship is observed between the concentration of cytokines (interleukins 1beta, 6 and 10 and tnf-alpha) and the inflammatory response in peri-implantitis tissue.

TI == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI == a filifactor alocis-centered co-occurrence group associates with periodontitis across different oral habitats.
AB == periodontitis is a highly prevalent polymicrobial disease worldwide, yet the synergistic pattern of the multiple oral pathogens involved is still poorly characterized. here, saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy volunteers were collected and profiled with 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing. different oral habitats harbored significantly different microbiota, and segregation of microbiota composition between periodontitis and health was observed as well. two-step redundancy analysis identified twenty-one otus, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and filifactor alocis, as potential pathogens that were significantly associated with periodontitis and with two periodontitis diagnostic parameters (pocket depth and attachment loss) in both saliva and supragingival plaque habitats. interestingly, pairwise correlation analysis among the 21 otus revealed that filifactor alocis was positively correlated with seven other putative pathogens (r > 0.6, p < 0.05), forming a co-occurrence group that was remarkably enriched in all three habitats of periodontitis patients. this bacterial cluster showed a higher diagnostic value for periodontitis than did any individual potential pathogens, especially in saliva. thus, our study identified a potential synergistic ecological pattern involving eight co-infecting pathogens across various oral habitats, providing a new framework for understanding the etiology of periodontitis and developing new diagnoses and therapies.

TI == p. gingivalis in periodontal disease and atherosclerosis - scenes of action for antimicrobial peptides and complement.
AB == according to the nhs, it is estimated that over 50% of the adult population are,  to some extent, affected by gum disease and approximately 15% of uk population have been diagnosed with severe periodontitis. periodontitis, a chronic polymicrobial disease of the gums, causes inflammation in its milder form, whereas in its severe form affects the surrounding tissues and can result in tooth loss. during periodontitis, plaque accumulates and sits between the junctional epithelium and the tooth itself, resulting in inflammation and the formation of a periodontal pocket. an interface is formed directly between the subgingival bacteria and the junctional epithelial cells. bacterial pathogens commonly associated with periodontal disease are, among others, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, together known as the "red complex." this review will mostly concentrate on the role of p. gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium and one of the major and most studied contributors of this disease. because periodontal disease is associated with the development of atherosclerosis, it is important to understand the local immune response to p. gingivalis. innate immune players, in particular, complement and antimicrobial peptides and their effects with regard to p. gingivalis during periodontitis and in the development of atherosclerosis will be presented.

AB == objective: the aim of the study was to compare the agreement and reproducibility  of three test kits (iai pado test 4[symbol: see text]5(r), micro-ident(r), and carpegen(r) perio diagnostik) regarding the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. materials and methods: periodontal plaque samples from 20 patients suffering from severe chronic or aggressive periodontitis were split into two identical batches. samples of batch 1 were evaluated immediately. samples of batch 2 were analyzed after a storage period of 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. results: the conformity of results obtained by the evaluated test kits as well as the concordant detection rate of periodontopathogens proved to be low. the agreement of the detection rate depends on the chosen test kit. the intra-test reproducibility of the qualitative analysis of identical plaque samples was perfect only for carpegen(r) perio diagnostik. the quantitative analysis of the results expressed as n-fold difference of the test results revealed an only poor inter-test agreement between the test systems. conclusions: results of test kits for the identification of periodontopathogens are significantly influenced by the detection technology applied. the most advanced technology tended to give the most reliable results. clinical relevance: as microbiological test results are supposed to be used for the planning of subsequent treatment strategies, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of results obtained by the different test systems and should use the results only in conjunction with clinical data for subsequent therapeutic decisions.

TI == anaerobic culture to detect periodontal and caries pathogens.
AB == background: anaerobic culture has been critical in our understanding of the oral  microbiotas. highlight: studies in advanced periodontitis in the 1970's revealed microbial complexes that associated with different clinical presentations. taxonomy studies identified species newly-observed in periodontitis as aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter (wolinella) rectus and other campylobacter species, and tannerella (bacteroides) forsythia. anaerobic culture of initial periodontitis showed overlap in the microbiota with gingivitis, and added selenomonas noxia and filifactor alocis as putative periodontal pathogens. porphyromonas gingivalis and t. forsythia were found to be associated with initial periodontitis in adults. the dominant microbiota of dental caries differs from that of periodontitis. the major cariogenic species are acidogenic and acid tolerant species particularly streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species. anaerobic culture of severe early childhood caries revealed a widely diverse microbiota, comparable to that observed using cloning and sequencing. the pcr-based cloning approach, however, underestimated actinobacteria compared with culture. only a subset of the caries-associated microbiota was acid tolerant, with different segments of the microbiota cultured on blood agar compared to a low ph acid agar. while the major caries-associated species was s. mutans, a new species, scardovia wiggsiae, was significantly associated with early childhood caries. higher counts of s. wiggsiae were also observed in initial white spot carious lesions in adolescents. conclusion: in periodontitis and dental caries, anaerobic culture studies of advanced disease provided a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of these infections. anaerobic culture highlighted the limitation of pcr with standard primers that underestimate detection of actinobacteria.

TI == anti-hmuy antibodies specifically recognize porphyromonas gingivalis hmuy protein but not homologous proteins in other periodontopathogens.
AB == given the emerging evidence of an association between periodontal infections and  systemic conditions, the search for specific methods to detect the presence of p. gingivalis, a principal etiologic agent in chronic periodontitis, is of high importance. the aim of this study was to characterize antibodies raised against purified p. gingivalis hmuy protein and selected epitopes of the hmuy molecule. since other periodontopathogens produce homologs of hmuy, we also aimed to characterize responses of antibodies raised against the hmuy protein or its epitopes to the closest homologous proteins from prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia. rabbits were immunized with purified hmuy protein or three synthetic, klh-conjugated peptides, derived from the p. gingivalis hmuy protein. the reactivity of anti-hmuy antibodies with purified proteins or bacteria was determined using western blotting and elisa assay. first, we found homologs of p. gingivalis hmuy in p. intermedia (pino and pina proteins) and t. forsythia (tfo protein) and identified corrected nucleotide and amino acid sequences of tfo. all proteins were overexpressed in e. coli and purified using ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography and gel filtration. we demonstrated that antibodies raised against p. gingivalis hmuy are highly specific to purified hmuy protein and hmuy attached to p. gingivalis cells. no reactivity between p. intermedia and t. forsythia or between purified hmuy homologs from these bacteria and anti-hmuy antibodies was detected. the results obtained in this study demonstrate that p. gingivalis hmuy protein may serve as an antigen for specific determination of serum antibodies raised against this bacterium.

TI == short-term effect of removal of fixed orthodontic appliances on gingival health and subgingival microbiota: a prospective cohort study.
AB == abstract objective. the aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to assess  and compare the microbiological and clinical parameters of patients wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance, as opposed to 10 days after the bracket had been removed following treatment. materials and methods. in total, 122 patients participated in this study; 61 of the subjects were assessed at baseline (wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance: t1) and 10 days after bracket removal (t2). the other 61 individuals had never worn an orthodontic appliance before and these subjects served as controls (ct). subgingival plaque samples were assessed for bleeding on probing (gbi) and plaque index (vpi). pcr of 16s rdna, followed by reverse species-specific hybridization for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were performed. a descriptive analysis was conducted; chi-squared, student's matched and unmatched t-tests, the point biserial correlation coefficient and the mcnemar test were used to test for differences between groups (p < 0.05). results. the gbi and vpi clinical parameters showed statistical differences (p < 0.05) between t1-t2, t1-ct and t2-ct. the prevalence of t. denticola had significantly decreased (p = 0.039) 10 days after appliance removal. at t2, a significant positive correlation was found between gbi and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.01) and between clinical parameters and p. intermedia. in patients without a fixed orthodontic appliance (t2 and ct), there was a significant positive correlation between t. forsythia and vpi. conclusion. local factors associated with the wearing of a fixed orthodontic appliance influence changes in subgingival plaque that leads to more inflammation and bleeding.

TI == combinations of bacterial species associated with symptomatic endodontic infections in a chinese population.
AB == aim: to use microarrays to detect 11 selected bacteria in infected root canals, revealing bacterial combinations that are associated with clinical symptoms and signs of primary endodontic infections in a chinese population. methodology: dna was extracted from 90 samples collected from the root canals of teeth with primary endodontic infections in a chinese population, and the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were hybridized to microarrays containing specific oligonucleotide probes targeting 11 species, and the arrays were screened with a confocal laser scanner. pearson's chi-squared test and cluster analysis were performed to investigate the associations between the bacterial combinations and clinical symptoms and signs using sas 8.02. results: seventy-seven samples (86%) yielded at least one of the 11 target species. parvimonas micra (56%), porphyromonas endodontalis (51%), tannerella forsythia (48%), prevotella intermedia (44%) and porphyromonas gingivalis (37%) were the most prevalent taxa and were often concomitant. the following positive associations were found between the bacterial combinations and clinical features: p. endodontalis and t. forsythia with abscess; p. gingivalis and p. micra with sinus tract; p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis or p. micra and p. endodontalis with abscess and sinus tract; and the combination of p. endodontalis, p. micra, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis with sinus tract (p < 0.05). conclusions: various combinations of p. micra, p. endodontalis, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis may contribute to abscesses or sinus tracts of endodontic origin with bacterial synergism in a chinese population.

TI == the effect of il-4 gene polymorphisms on cytokine production in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy controls.
AB == chronic periodontitis (cp) is an inflammatory disease of the teeth-supporting tissues in which genetic predisposition, dental plaque bacteria, and immune mechanisms all play important roles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of il-4 gene polymorphisms in chronic periodontitis and to investigate the association between polymorphisms and cytokines production after bacterial stimulation. sixty-two subjects (47 cp patients and 15 healthy controls) with detected two polymorphisms in the il-4 gene (-590c/t and intron 3 vntr) were examined. production of cytokines (il-1alpha, il-1beta, il-4, il-5, il-6, il-10, il-17, tnfalpha, infgamma, and vegf) was studied after in vitro stimulation of isolated peripheral blood by mitogens (pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin a), dental plaque bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia), and heat shock protein (hsp) 70 by the luminex multiplex cytokine analysis system. the results were correlated with il-4 genotypes in patients with cp and healthy controls. the mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of cp patients with selected il-4 polymorphisms significantly altered the production of ifngamma, il-10, il-1beta, il-1alpha, tnfalpha, and il-6 after stimulation by hsp 70 or selected bacteria (from p < 0.001 to p < 0.05). il-4 gene polymorphisms may influence the function of mononuclear cells to produce not only interleukin-4 but also other cytokines, especially in patients with cp.

TI == analysis of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and s. aureus levels in edentulous mouths prior to and 6 months after placement of one-piece zirconia and titanium implants.
AB == background: it has been suggested that completely edentulous patients harbour fewer periodontopathic bacteria compared with dentate patients, due to the removal of the subgingival periodontal environment. however, reappearance of certain microbes has been reported after the placement of implants in these patients. aim: the aim of this study was to determine whether the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, as well as the non-periodontopathic bacterium, staphylococcus aureus, emerged in edentulous patients 6 months after placement of one-piece zirconia and titanium implants. materials and methods: twenty-six patients were included in the study (titanium = 13, zirconia = 13). microbial samples were collected from the tongue prior to implant placement and 6 months after implant placement from both the tongue and from around the implants. a qrt-pcr assay using sybr green/rox chemistry was used for the detection and quantification of rgp, nuc and karilysin single-copy gene of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and s. aureus, respectively. positive controls used in the study were pure bacterial gdna purified from cultures of p. gingivalis and s. aureus, a cloned sequence of the karilysin gene for t. forsythia, a plaque sample positive for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, and nasal gdna for s. aureus. results: the results show that prior to implant placement, all three bacterial species were below the lower limit of quantification in all edentulous patients. the samples collected from the tongue and around the implants remained below the lower limit of quantification for each of the three species. however, all positive controls used in the study were detectable in the samples. qpcr standard curves showed correlation coefficients >0.97 and efficiencies >94.5% (slope range -3.19 to -3.46) for each of the sybr green pcr assays. conclusion: the results of this study indicate that the tested organisms did not emerge 6 months after implant placement irrespective of the nature of the implant biomaterial. a further follow-up of at least 2 years post-implantation of these patients is suggested to determine whether there are any changes in the oral microbiota and whether such changes are associated with the development of peri-implant disease.

(p < 0.05). presence of other red complex bacteria shows clinical association with presence of signs and symptoms but no statistically significant relationship. conclusion: the high prevalence of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia in the examined samples suggests that these bacteria are related to the etiology of symptomatic periradicular diseases.

AB == the oral microbiome plays a key role for caries, periodontitis, and systemic diseases. a method for rapid, high-resolution, robust taxonomic profiling of subgingival bacterial communities for early detection of periodontitis biomarkers would therefore be a useful tool for individualized medicine. here, we used illumina sequencing of the v1-v2 and v5-v6 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene. a sample stratification pipeline was developed in a pilot study of 19 individuals, 9 of whom had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. five hundred twenty-three operational taxonomic units (otus) were obtained from the v1-v2 region and 432 from the v5-v6 region. key periodontal pathogens like porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia could be identified at the species level with both primer sets. principal coordinate analysis identified two outliers that were consistently independent of the hypervariable region and method of dna extraction used. the linear discriminant analysis (lda) effect size algorithm (lefse) identified 80 otu-level biomarkers of periodontitis and 17 of health. health- and periodontitis-related clusters of otus were identified using a connectivity analysis, and the results confirmed previous studies with several thousands of samples. a machine learning algorithm was developed which was trained on all but one sample and then predicted the diagnosis of the left-out sample (jackknife method). using a combination of the 10 best biomarkers, 15 of 17 samples were correctly diagnosed. training the algorithm on time-resolved community profiles might provide a highly sensitive tool to detect the onset of periodontitis.

TI == shifts in campylobacter species abundance may reflect general microbial community shifts in periodontitis progression.
AB == background: oral campylobacter species have been found to be associated with periodontitis progression. while the etiological significance of campylobacter rectus is quite established, the association of c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c. curvus with health or disease remains contradictory. objectives: this study hypothesizes that the proportion of species within the campylobacter genus rather than the absolute abundance of a single species is a suitable indicator for periodontitis progression. design: subgingival plaque from 90 periodontitis patients and gingival sulcus fluid of 32 healthy individuals were subjected to a newly developed nested pcr approach, in which all campylobacter spp. were amplified simultaneously. the resulting mixture of 16s-rrna-gene-amplicons were separated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (sscp) gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing and identification of excised bands and relative quantification of band intensities. in all samples, the abundance of selected periodontitis marker species was determined based on dna hybridization on a microarray. results: the highly prevalent campylobacter community was composed of varying proportions of c. rectus, c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c. curvus. cluster analysis based on sscp-banding pattern resulted in distinct groups which in turn coincided with significant differences in abundance of established periodontitis marker species (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and progression. conclusions: the shift in the campylobacter community composition seems to display the general microbial community shift during clinical progression in a simplified manner. the focus on members of the campylobacter in this study suggests that this genus can be an indicator of ecological changes in the subgingival oral microflora.

AB == abstract objective: to relate the periodontal condition with the presence of periodontal bacteria in pregnant that had babies with preterm delivery or/and low weight at birth (ptlbw). methods: we recruited 134 pregnant women without systemic diseases attending at the gynaecology and obstetrics room, from maternal provincial hospital, cordoba, argentine. pregnant were grouped according to the international classification for a system of periodontal disease. a sample from periodontal pocket was extracted to identify porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf) prevotella intermedia (pi) and agreggatibacter actinomycemcomitans (aa). results: we identified 7 (5%) cases of children born underweight or preterm of mothers diagnosed with gingivitis, 6 (4%) in mild periodontitis and 4 (3%) in moderate periodontitis. we estimated that when pi and/or aa were not detected in the periodontal pockets of mothers, the infants had more than 129% chance of having normal birth weights (or 3.47 for pi and or and 2.29 for aa). the average age of the mothers who has ptlbw was 21 +/- 3.5. the age showed an association with ptlbw (p < 0.0008). conclusions: the presences of periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets from pregnant with different periodontal status would associate with ptlbw infants when the mothers are young, and the normal term and normal birth weight infant are associated with the absence of periodonto bacteria like pi and aa.

TI == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated. fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

AB == purpose: to verify the presence of socransky red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia) and p. intermedia using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in periodontally healthy pregnant women and pregnant women with periodontal disease, as well as its relation to arterial blood pressure and capillary glycaemia. materials and methods: this case control study included 86 pregnant women, including 50 pregnant women with healthy periodontium, 27 with gingivitis and 9 with periodontitis. arterial blood pressure and glycaemia were evaluated and recorded. clinical specimens from the gingival crevice or periodontal pockets were gathered with sterile absorbent paper cones. dna extraction was accomplished using the easy-dna kit test and the presence of bacteria was detected by pcr with primers and specific probes for each microorganism. results: the arterial pressure of all pregnant women was found to be within normal levels and 51% presented with hyperglycaemia, these two variables were not associated with periodontal conditions and/or presence of microorganisms. socransky red complex was not present in pregnant women with healthy periodontium; however, it was present in pregnant women with gingivitis (3.7%) and in a higher percentage of pregnant women with periodontitis (33.3%). conclusion: socransky red complex was found only in cases of periodontal diseases and is not related to blood pressure and/or high levels of blood glucose.

TI == the effect of conventional mechanical periodontal treatment on red complex microorganisms and clinical parameters in down syndrome periodontitis patients: a pilot study.
AB == periodontal disease (pd) is induced by a complex microbiota, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola (together called the red complex), which triggers intense inflammatory reaction. down syndrome (ds) individuals demonstrate a high prevalence of pd compared with those who are otherwise chromosomally normal (euploids). this pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment in ds chronic periodontitis patients on clinical and microbiological parameters. patients with chronic periodontitis, 23 ds and 12 euploids (control group), were submitted to non-surgical mechanical periodontal treatment, followed by maintenance for 45 days. clinical parameters after periodontal treatment were similar in diseased and healthy sites, independent of the genetic background. diseased sites of ds and control patients harbored similar levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at baseline, but significantly higher levels of t. denticola were found in ds patients. increased levels of p. gingivalis at healthy sites were found in ds individuals. non-surgical periodontal therapy decreased the levels of red complex microorganisms and improved the tested clinical parameters of diseased sites in both groups. however, the levels of red complex bacteria were higher in diseased sites of ds patients after the periodontal treatment. we conclude in this pilot study that, although the mechanical periodontal treatment seemed to be effective in ds subjects over a short-term period, the red complex bacteria levels did not decrease significantly in diseased sites, as occurred in controls. therefore, for ds patients, it seems that the conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy should be improved by utilizing adjuvants to reduce the presence of periodontopathogens.

TI == role of porphyromonas gingivalis gingipains in multi-species biofilm formation.
AB == background: periodontal diseases are polymicrobial diseases that cause the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues. their initiation is attributed to the formation of subgingival biofilms that stimulate a cascade of chronic inflammatory reactions by the affected tissue. the gram-negative anaerobes porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are commonly found as part of the microbiota of subgingival biofilms, and they are associated with the occurrence and severity of the disease. p. gingivalis expresses several virulence factors that may support its survival, regulate its communication with other species in the biofilm, or modulate the inflammatory response of the colonized host tissue. the most prominent of these virulence factors are the gingipains, which are a set of cysteine proteinases (either arg-specific or lys-specific). the role of gingipains in the biofilm-forming capacity of p. gingivalis is barely investigated. hence, this in vitro study employed a biofilm model consisting of 10 "subgingival" bacterial species, incorporating either a wild-type p. gingivalis strain or its derivative lys-gingipain and arg-gingipan isogenic mutants, in order to evaluate quantitative and qualitative changes in biofilm composition. results: following 64 h of biofilm growth, the levels of all 10 species were quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization or immunofluorescence. the wild-type and the two gingipain-deficient p. gingivalis strains exhibited similar growth in their corresponding biofilms. among the remaining nine species, only the numbers of t. forsythia were significantly reduced, and only when the lys-gingipain mutant was present in the biofilm. when evaluating the structure of the biofilm by confocal laser scanning microscopy, the most prominent observation was a shift in the spatial arrangement of t. denticola, in the presence of p. gingivalis arg-gingipain mutant. conclusions: the gingipains of p. gingivalis may qualitatively and quantitatively affect composition of polymicrobial biofilms. the present experimental model reveals interdependency between the gingipains of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia or t. denticola.

TI == antibodies to periodontal pathogens are associated with coronary plaque remodeling but not with vulnerability or burden.
AB == objective: previous studies have suggested positive associations between periodontal infection and cardiovascular disease. we aimed to investigate the associations of circulating antibodies against periodontal pathogens with 1-year cardiovascular outcome, as well as the extent of coronary atherosclerosis, plaque vulnerability and lesion remodeling on intravascular ultrasound (ivus) imaging. methods: between 2008 and 2011, radiofrequency ivus imaging of a non-culprit coronary artery was performed in 581 patients who underwent coronary angiography. immunoglobulin g (igg) and a (iga) against porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were measured in plasma. results: none of the antibody levels were associated with coronary plaque burden, radiofreqeuncy-ivus-derived thin-cap fibroatheroma lesion morphology or 1-year incidence of major adverse cardiac events (mace), which included all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome and unplanned coronary revascularization. iga against a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythia and p. intermedia were inversely associated with extent of positive lesion remodeling (or for highest versus lowest tertile 0.55, 95%ci 0.35-0.88, p = 0.012; 0.53, 95%ci 0.32-0.87, p = 0.012; and 0.64, 95%ci 0.40-1.02, p = 0.061, respectively). in diabetic patients specifically, igg against p. gingivalis tended to be associated with coronary plaque burden (p = 0.080), while iga against p. gingivalis tended to be associated with incident mace (p = 0.060). conclusion: plasma igg and iga against major periodontal pathogens were not associated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (with the exception of a trend in diabetics) nor with coronary plaque vulnerability. iga against periodontal pathogens were inversely associated with extent of coronary remodeling. altogether, these results do not add evidence for a substantial role of systemic exposure to periodontal pathogens in coronary artery disease.

TI == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women, particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI == neutrophil mobilization by surface-glycan altered th17-skewing bacteria mitigates periodontal pathogen persistence and associated alveolar bone loss.
AB == alveolar bone (tooth-supporting bone) erosion is a hallmark of periodontitis, an  inflammatory disease that often leads to tooth loss. periodontitis is caused by a select group of pathogens that form biofilms in subgingival crevices between the gums and teeth. it is well-recognized that the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis in these biofilms is responsible for modeling a microbial dysbiotic state, which then initiates an inflammatory response destructive to the periodontal tissues and bone. eradication of this pathogen is thus critical for the treatment of periodontitis. previous studies have shown that oral inoculation in mice with an attenuated strain of the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia altered in o-glycan surface composition induces a th17-linked mobilization of neutrophils to the gingival tissues. in this study, we sought to determine if immune priming with such a th17-biasing strain would elicit a productive neutrophil response against p. gingivalis. our data show that inoculation with a th17-biasing t. forsythia strain is effective in blocking p. gingivalis-persistence and associated alveolar bone loss in mice. this work demonstrates the potential of o-glycan modified tannerella strains or their o-glycan components for harnessing th17-mediated immunity against periodontal and other mucosal pathogens.

AB == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24 were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery, general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term infants than in premature infants.

TI == periodontal bacteria in human carotid atherothrombosis as a potential trigger for neutrophil activation.
AB == objective: epidemiological, biological and clinical links between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases are now well established. several human studies have detected bacterial dna corresponding to periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular samples. intraplaque hemorrhage has been associated with a higher risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, potentially mediated by neutrophil activation. in this study, we hypothesized that plaque composition may be related to periodontal pathogens. methods: carotid culprit plaque samples were collected from 157 patients. macroscopic characterization was performed at the time of collection: presence of blood, lipid core, calcification and fibrosis. markers of neutrophil activation released by carotid samples were quantified (myeloperoxidase or mpo, cell-free dna and dna-mpo complexes). pcr analysis using specific primers for porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcommitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia was used to detect dna from periodontal pathogens in carotid tissues. in addition, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and immunoglobulins g against t. forsythia were quantified in atherosclerotic carotid conditioned medium. results: intraplaque hemorrhage was present in 73/157 carotid samples and was associated with neutrophil activation, reflected by the release of mpo, cell-free dna and mpo-dna complexes. lps levels were also linked to intraplaque hemorrhage but not with the neutrophil activation markers. seventy-three percent of the carotid samples were positive for periodontal bacterial dna. furthermore, hemoglobin levels were associated with the detection of t. forsythia and neutrophil activation/inflammation markers. conclusion: this study suggests a potential role of periodontal microorganisms, especially t. forsythia, in neutrophil activation within hemorrhagic atherosclerotic carotid plaques.

TI == comparative genome analysis and identification of competitive and cooperative interactions in a polymicrobial disease.
AB == polymicrobial diseases are caused by combinations of multiple bacteria, which can lead to not only mild but also life-threatening illnesses. periodontitis represents a polymicrobial disease; porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, called 'the red complex', have been recognized as the causative agents of periodontitis. although molecular interactions among the three species could be responsible for progression of periodontitis, the relevant genetic mechanisms are unknown. in this study, we uncovered novel interactions in comparative genome analysis among the red complex species. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crisprs) of t. forsythia might attack the restriction modification system of p. gingivalis, and possibly work as a defense system against dna invasion from p. gingivalis. on the other hand, gene deficiencies were mutually compensated in metabolic pathways when the genes of all the three species were taken into account, suggesting that there are cooperative relationships among the three species. this notion was supported by the observation that each of the three species had its own virulence factors, which might facilitate persistence and manifestations of virulence of the three species. here, we propose new mechanisms of bacterial symbiosis in periodontitis; these mechanisms consist of competitive and cooperative interactions. our results might shed light on the pathogenesis of periodontitis and of other polymicrobial diseases.

TI == dentilisin involvement in coaggregation between treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia.
AB == periodontitis arises from a biofilm consisting of gram-negative anaerobic rods and spirochetes. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, termed the red complex, have been co-isolated with high frequency from chronic periodontitis lesions, and these microorganisms are thought to be major pathogens of the disease. coaggregation is an important strategy in the colonization of dental plaque biofilm by these bacteria. in the present study, we investigated the coaggregation of t. denticola strains with t. forsythia atcc 43037 by use of visual grading or spectrophotometry. t. denticola atcc 35405 coaggregated with t. forsythia, reaching a plateau at approximately 60 min. this coaggregation was inhibited by heat treatment of t. denticola atcc 35405, but not of t. forsythia. disaccharides such as sucrose, maltose, and lactose inhibited coaggregation by approximately 50%. the coaggregation reaction varied among t. denticola strains. there was somewhat less coaggregation between t. denticola atcc 33520 and t. forsythia than between t. denticola atcc 35405 and t. forsythia, although this difference was not statistically significant; t. denticola atcc 33521 showed a trace level of coaggregation with t. forsythia. the magnitude of coaggregation among the three t. denticola strains was proportional to their dentilisin activities. inactivation of dentilisin abolished coaggregation activity, but inactivation of the major outer sheath protein did not. in addition, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not affect coaggregation. these results indicate that dentilisin is involved indirectly in the coaggregation between t. denticola and t. forsythia, because its proteolytic activity is not required, possibly via ligand maturation.

TI == periodontitis in rats induces systemic oxidative stress that is controlled by bone-targeted antiresorptives.
AB == background: periodontitis is a chronic, polymicrobial inflammatory disease that degrades connective tissue and alveolar bone and results in tooth loss. oxidative stress has been linked to the onset of periodontal tissue breakdown and systemic inflammation, and the success of antiresorptive treatments will rely on how effectively they can ameliorate periodontal disease-induced oxidative stress during oral infection. methods: rats were infected with polybacterial inoculum consisting of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as an oral lavage every other week for 12 weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin, bis-enoxacin, alendronate, or doxycycline were administered for 6 weeks after 6 weeks of polybacterial infection in rats. the serum levels of oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, were evaluated in each of the infected, treated, and sham-infected rats. results: rats infected with the periodontal pathogens displayed a five-fold increase in the oxidative stress index compared with controls as a result of increased levels of serum oxidants and decreases in total antioxidant activity. the overall decrease in antioxidant activity occurred despite increases in three important antioxidant enzymes, suggesting an imbalance between antioxidant macromolecules/small molecules production and antioxidant enzyme levels. surprisingly, the bone-targeted antiresorptives bis-enoxacin and alendronate inhibited increases in oxidative stress caused by periodontitis. bis-enoxacin, which has both antiresorptive and antibiotic activities, was more effective than alendronate, which acts only as an antiresorptive. conclusion: to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the increased oxidative stress induced by periodontal infection in rats can be ameliorated by bone-targeted antiresorptives.

AB == tannerella forsythia is considered a pathogen of periodontitis and forms a biofilm with multi-species bacteria in oral cavity. lipopolysaccharide is a powerful immunostimulator and induces inflammation and shock. the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of t. forsythia lps in its co-cultivation with fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis. t. forsythia was co-cultured in the presence and absence of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis and then t. forsythia lps was extracted. the extracts were analyzed by sds-page and nf-kappab reporter cho cell lines. thp-1 cells were treated with the lps and evaluated induction of cytokine expression by real-time rt-pcr and elisa. for analysis of the bioactivity of t. forsythia lps, the binding assay on lps-binding protein (lbp) and cd14 was processed. the extracts did not contaminate other molecules except lps and showed tlr4 agonists. co-cultured t. forsythia lps with p. gingivalis exhibited a lower level of induction of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-6 expression than single- or co-cultured t. forsythia lps with f. nucleatum in the conditions of human serum. however, the three t. forsythia lps did not show difference of cytokine induction in the serum free conditions. co-cultured t. forsythia lps with p. gingivalis exhibited a lower affinity to lbp and cd14 as binding site of o-antigen and attached at a lower level to thp-1 cells compared to single- or co-cultured t. forsythia lps with f. nucleatum. the virulence of t. forsythia lps was decreased by co-culturing with p. gingivalis and their affinity to lbp and cd14 was reduced, which may due to modification of o-antigen chain by p. gingivalis.

AB == periodontal disease is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease that leads to chronic systemic inflammation and direct infiltration of bacteria/bacterial components, which may contribute to the development of alzheimer's disease. apoe-/- mice were orally infected (n = 12) with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as mono- and polymicrobial infections. apoe-/- mice were sacrificed following 12 and 24 weeks of chronic infection. bacterial genomic dna was isolated from all brain tissues except for the f. nucleatum mono-infected group. polymerase chain reaction was performed using universal 16 s rdna primers and species-specific primer sets for each organism to determine whether the infecting pathogens accessed the brain. sequencing amplification products confirmed the invasion of bacteria into the brain during infection. the innate immune responses were detected using antibodies against complement activation products of c3 convertase stage and the membrane attack complex. molecular methods demonstrated that 6 out of 12 apoe-/- mice brains contained p. gingivalis genomic dna at 12 weeks (p = 0.006), and 9 out of 12 at 24 weeks of infection (p = 0.0001). microglia in both infected and control groups demonstrated strong intracellular labeling with c3 and c9, due to on-going biosynthesis. the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in 4 out of 12 infected mice brains demonstrated characteristic opsonization with c3 activation fragments (p = 0.032). these results show that the oral pathogen p. gingivalis was able to access the apoe-/- mice brain and thereby contributed to complement activation with bystander neuronal injury.

TI == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI == quantitative analysis of classical and new putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm: a case-control study.
AB == background and objectives: a number of species/phylotypes have been newly implicated as putative periopathogens. the objective of this study was to explore associations among classical and new pathogens in subgingival biofilm and to assess their relative importance to chronic periodontitis. material and methods: pooled subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis and 40 healthy controls. taqman q-pcr assays were used to determine the absolute and relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, oral synergistetes and oral tm7s. microbial associations were assessed using cluster analysis. different statistical models were used to explore associations between microbial parameters and periodontitis. results: the median log and relative counts were lowest for tm7s (4.4 and 0.0016%, respectively) and highest for oral synergistetes (7.2 and 1.4%, respectively). oral synergistetes clustered strongly with the red complex, particularly t. forsythia (100% rescaled similarity). all species/phylotypes except tm7s were significantly associated with periodontitis (mann-whitney test; p </= 0.005). however, p. gingivalis and f. alocis lost association after adjusting for confounders (ordinal regression). in receiving operator characteristic curve analysis, the log counts of oral synergistetes were the best markers of periodontitis (82.5% sensitivity and specificity), followed by those of t. forsythia, p. micra and t. denticola. in prediction analysis, however, p. micra was the only microbial predictor of periodontal parameters. conclusions: oral synergistetes are presented here as new members of the red complex, with relative importance to periodontitis exceeding that of the classical members. p. micra is shown as an important periodontal pathogen warranting more attention.

TI == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI == oral inflammation, tooth loss, risk factors, and association with progression of  alzheimer's disease.
AB == periodontitis is a polymicrobial chronic inflammatory disease of tooth-supporting tissues with bacterial etiology affecting all age groups, becoming chronic in a subgroup of older individuals. periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola are implicated in the development of a number of inflammatory pathologies at remote organ sites, including alzheimer's disease (ad). the initial inflammatory hypothesis proposed that ad hallmark proteins were the main contributors of central nervous system (cns) inflammation. this hypothesis is expanding to include the role of infections, lifestyle, and genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of ad. periodontal disease (pd) typifies a condition that encompasses all of the above factors including pathogenic bacteria. these bacteria not only are the source of low-grade, chronic infection and inflammation that follow daily episodes of bacteremia arising from everyday tasks such as brushing, flossing teeth, chewing food, and during dental procedures, but they also disseminate into the brain from closely related anatomical pathways. the long-term effect of inflammatory mediators, pathogens, and/or their virulence factors, reaching the brain systemically or otherwise would, over time, prime the brain's own microglia in individuals who have inherent susceptibility traits. such susceptibilities contribute to inadequate neutralization of invading agents, upon reaching the brain. this has the capacity to create a vicious cycle of sustained local inflammatory milieu resulting in the loss of cytoarchitectural integrity and vital neurons with subsequent loss of function (deterioration in memory). the possible pathways between pd and ad development are considered here, as well as environmental factors that may modulate/exacerbate ad symptoms.

TI == expression and regulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 in  periodontal diseases.
AB == periodontitis is an inflammatory infectious disease that destroys the tooth-supporting tissues. it is caused by multi-species subgingival biofilms that colonize the tooth surface. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia (i.e. 'red complex' bacteria) are characteristic subgingival biofilm species. the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (trem-1) is a cell surface receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, with a role in the amplification of proinflammatory cytokine production during infection. this study aimed to investigate trem-1 mrna expression in gingival tissues from patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis and healthy subjects and its correlation with the levels of periodontal pathogens in the tissue. a further aim was to investigate the regulation of trem-1 in human monocytic cells (mm6) challenged with an in-vitro subgingival biofilm model. gingival tissue trem-1 expression was increased in both chronic and aggressive periodontitis, compared to health, and correlated with the levels of the 'red complex' species in the tissue. no significant differences were detected between the two forms of periodontitis. biofilm-challenged mm6 cells exhibited higher trem-1 expression and secretion compared to controls, with partial involvement of the 'red complex'. engagement or inhibition of trem-1 affected the capacity of the biofilms to stimulate interleukin (il)-1beta, but not il-8, secretion by the cells. in conclusion, this study reveals that trem-1 tissue expression is enhanced in periodontal disease, and correlates with the level of periodontal pathogens. it also provides a mechanistic insight into the regulation of trem-1 expression and the associated il-1beta production in biofilm-challenged monocytes.

TI == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI == porphyromonas gingivalis: major periodontopathic pathogen overview.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative oral anaerobe that is involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and is a member of more than 500 bacterial species that live in the oral cavity. this anaerobic bacterium is a natural member of the oral microbiome, yet it can become highly destructive (termed pathobiont) and proliferate to high cell numbers in periodontal lesions: this is attributed to its arsenal of specialized virulence factors. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of one of the main periodontal pathogens-porphyromonas gingivalis. this bacterium, along with treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, constitute the "red complex," a prototype polybacterial pathogenic consortium in periodontitis. this review outlines porphyromonas gingivalis structure, its metabolism, its ability to colonize the epithelial cells, and its influence upon the host immunity.

TI == genetic characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of periodontal pathogens.
AB == periodontal disease is caused by a group of bacteria that utilize a variety of strategies and molecular mechanisms to evade or overcome host defenses. recent research has uncovered new evidence illuminating interesting aspects of the virulence of these bacteria and their genomic variability. this paper summarizes some of the strategies utilized by the major species - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis - implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. whole-genome sequencing of 14 diverse a. actinomycetemcomitans strains has revealed variations in their genetic content (ranging between 0.4% and 19.5%) and organization. strikingly, isolates from human periodontal sites showed no genomic changes during persistent colonization. t. forsythia manipulates the cytokine responses of macrophages and monocytes through its surface glycosylation. studies have revealed that bacterial surface-expressed o-linked glycans modulate t-cell responses during periodontal inflammation. periodontal pathogens belonging to the "red complex" consortium express neuraminidases, which enables them to scavenge sialic acid from host glycoconjugates. analysis of recent data has demonstrated that the cleaved sialic acid acts as an important nutrient for bacterial growth and a molecule for the decoration of bacteria surfaces to help evade the host immune attack. in addition, bacterial entry into host cells is also an important prerequisite for the lifestyle of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis. studies have shown that, after its entry into the cell, this bacterium uses multiple sorting pathways destined for autophagy, lysosomes, or recycling pathways. in addition, p. gingivalis releases outer membrane vesicles which enter cells via endocytosis and cause cellular functional impairment.

TI == bis-enoxacin blocks rat alveolar bone resorption from experimental periodontitis.
AB == periodontal diseases are multifactorial, caused by polymicrobial subgingival pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. chronic periodontal infection results in inflammation, destruction of connective tissues, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone resorption, and ultimately tooth loss. enoxacin and a bisphosphonate derivative of enoxacin (bis-enoxacin) inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption and also contain antibiotic properties. our study proposes that enoxacin and/or bis-enoxacin may be useful in reducing alveolar bone resorption and possibly bacterial colonization. rats were infected with 10(9) cells of polymicrobial inoculum consisting of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, as an oral lavage every other week for twelve weeks. daily subcutaneous injections of enoxacin (5 mg/kg/day), bis-enoxacin (5, 25 mg/kg/day), alendronate (1, 10 mg/kg/day), or doxycycline (5 mg/day) were administered after 6 weeks of polymicrobial infection. periodontal disease parameters, including bacterial colonization/infection, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone resorption, and systemic spread, were assessed post-euthanasia. all three periodontal pathogens colonized the rat oral cavity during polymicrobial infection. polymicrobial infection induced an increase in total alveolar bone resorption, intrabony defects, and gingival inflammation. treatment with bis-enoxacin significantly decreased alveolar bone resorption more effectively than either alendronate or doxycycline. histologic examination revealed that treatment with bis-enoxacin and enoxacin reduced gingival inflammation and decreased apical migration of junctional epithelium. these data support the hypothesis that bis-enoxacin and enoxacin may be useful for the treatment of periodontal disease.

(13.9%), filifactor sp. (12.5%), and parvimonas sp. (11.1%), similar to the genera obtained from pp samples. in total, 43 genera/species were common to the rc and pp samples. the most prevalent bacteria in both the rc and pp samples were (in descending order) filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the high similarity in the sets of organisms present in both rc and pp samples in this study suggests that the pocket could be a source of rc infection. the data also demonstrate that combined periodontal-endodontic lesions consist of a diverse and complex microbial community.

AB == aim: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effect of systemic levofloxacin (lfx) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: sixty-five patients with cp were randomly divided into a test (n = 33, srp and lfx 500 mg, once daily [o.d.]) and a control group (n = 32, srp and placebo, o.d.). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), percentage of sites with bleeding on probing (%bop), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal) were recorded at baseline, 10 days, and 1-, 3-, and 6-month intervals. the percentage of sites positive for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. results: patients receiving lfx showed statistically-significant improvements in mean pd and cal. the intergroup difference in pi, gi, and%bop was not significant at any interval. there was a reduction in the percentage of sites positive for periodontopathic bacteria over the duration of the study in both groups, and a statistically-significant reduction in the number of sites positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans in the lfx group (p < 0.001). conclusion: levofloxacin was found to significantly improve the clinical and microbiological parameters in cp individuals.

TI == [dissertations 25 years after date 37. susceptibility to periodontal diseases].
AB == in the eighties of the former century it was observed that individuals had different modes of development of periodontitis, largely for unknown reasons. it was assumed that periodontal disease developed as a result of the presence of virulent micro-organisms in combination with an inadequate host response. the concept of this (im)balance in host parasite interactions developed further, in part because of new research techniques. with respect to oral bacteria it was shown that periodontal pathogens like aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are risk factors for periodontitis. furthermore, genetic polymorphisms (snp's) have been shown to modulate the host response against the periopathogens. medical and lifestyle factors, e.g. diabetes mellitus, smoking, psychological stress and, to a minor extent, also hormonal changes can have an impact on the progression of periodontitis. all this information contributes to determining the individual risk profile of a patient for developing periodontitis and for estimating the prognosis of periodontal treatment and maintenance care on an individual basis.

TI == prevelance of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm and atherosclerotic plaques of patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery.
AB == aim: the objective of the present study was to detect the presence of specific periodontopathogenic bacteria in the coronary plaque of patients with coronary artery disease and to find out the significant association between the periodontal status and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the coronary plaque. materials and methods: the study population consisted of 51 patients with chronic generalized periodontitis undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. periodontal parameters were recorded and deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the subgingival plaque and coronary atherosclerotic plaque samples of the same patients. polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the part of 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene to detect the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivali (pg), porphyromonas gingivalis (fima) gene and treponema denticola (td). results: aa, tf, pg, pg (fima) gene and td were detected in 0%, 31.4%, 45.1% 39.2% and 51% of atherosclerotic plaque samples, respectively. tf was detected in 19.6%, pg in 39.2%, pg (fima) gene in 33.3% and td in 35.3% of both, subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaque samples. periodontal parameters correlated with the presence of bacteria in coronary plaque. aa could not be detected in coronary plaque samples. conclusions: the study confirmed the detection of red complex bacteria in coronary plaque samples and these bacteria correlated with the severity of periodontal destruction.

TI == subgingival plaque sampling after combined mechanical and antibiotic nonsurgical  periodontal therapy.
AB == aim: this study aimed to make a comparison of two sampling strategies of subgingival plaque after combined mechanical-antibiotic periodontal therapy. methods: thirty patients (18 female) suffering from aggressive (n = 12) or generalised severe chronic (n = 18) periodontitis were included. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans had been detected subgingivally in all prior to anti-infective therapy (at) and combined mechanical-antibiotic at had been rendered. after at clinical examinations were performed and subgingival plaque was sampled from the same four sites as prior to at (aspre) as well as from the four deepest sites after at (deep). per patient two pooled samples (aspre/deep) were generated and analysed for a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola using a commercial 16s rrna test. results: aspre failed to detect a. actinomycetemcomitans, deep detected a. actinomycetemcomitans only in two patients (7 %). only for t. forsythia deep (53 %) provided higher detection frequencies than aspre (27 %; p = 0.005). detection frequencies of p. gingivalis and t. denticola ranged from 47 to 53 %. conclusion: after combined mechanical-antibiotic at sampling the deepest sites revealed higher detection rates. combined mechanical-antibiotic at suppresses a. actinomycetemcomitans to a higher extent than p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola.

TI == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes. while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

AB == background: the aim of this investigation is to quantify periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, and tannerella forsythia) in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples. as a secondary objective, two molecular bacterial identification methods (nested polymerase chain reaction [pcr] and quantitative pcr [qpcr]) are compared. methods: seventy consecutive patients provided a vascular lesion, a blood sample, and 36 subgingival samples. bacterial dna was extracted, and qpcr was used to determine the prevalence and amounts of the target pathogens in each sample. nested pcr was performed only in the samples from vascular lesions. periodontal examination was performed in 42 patients. mann-whitney u or chi(2) tests were used to compare microbiologic results according to periodontal diagnosis. results: all targeted periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, or c. rectus) were detected in subgingival samples, with a prevalence rate of 72.2%, 47.2%, 74.3%, and 82.9%, respectively. in 7.1% and 11.4% of vascular and blood samples, bacterial dna was detected. one patient was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans in the three types of samples. no differences were found in the levels of targeted bacteria when comparing patients with and without periodontitis. prevalence rates obtained with nested pcr were significantly higher than those obtained with qpcr. conclusions: the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was demonstrated in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples in one of 36 patients. these results, although with a very low frequency, may support the hypothesis of a translocation of periodontal pathogens from subgingival microbiota to the bloodstream and then to atheromatous plaques in carotid or other peripheral arteries. nested pcr is not an adequate method for identifying dna of periodontal pathogens in low quantities because of the high number of false-negative results.

AB == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI == in vitro-activity of oily calcium hydroxide suspension on microorganisms as well  as on human alveolar osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB == background: findings from animal and human studies have indicated that an oily calcium hydroxide suspension (ochs) may improve early wound healing in the treatment of periodontitis. calcium hydroxide as the main component is well known for its antimicrobial activity, however at present the effect of ochs on the influence of periodontal wound healing/regeneration is still very limited. the purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of ochs on periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as on the attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. methods: human alveolar osteoblasts (hao) and periodontal ligament (pdl) fibroblasts were cultured on 3 concentrations of ochs (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg). adhesion and proliferation were counted up to 48 h and mineralization was assayed after 1 and 2 weeks. furthermore potential growth inhibitory activity on microorganisms associated with periodontal disease (e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) as well as the influence of periodontopathogens and ochs on the hao and pdl fibroblasts counts were determined. results: more than a 2-fold increase in adherent hao cells was observed at 4 h following application of ochs when compared to the control group (p = 0.007 for 2.5 mg). proliferation of hao cells at 48 h was stimulated by moderate concentrations (2.5 mg; 5 mg) of ochs (each p < 0.001), whereas a high concentration (7.5 mg) of ochs was inhibitory (p = 0.009). mineralization was observed only for hao cells treated with ochs. ochs did not exert any positive effect on attachment or proliferation of pdl fibroblasts. although ochs did not have an antibacterial effect, it did positively influence attachment and proliferation of hao cells and pdl fibroblasts in the presence of periodontopathogens. conclusions: the present data suggests that ochs promotes osteoblast attachment, proliferation and mineralization in a concentration-dependent manner and results are maintained in the presence of periodontal pathogens.

AB == objective: red complex bacteria (treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) play a major role in the aetiology of periodontal disease in humans. this study was designed to evaluate the association of such bacteria with periodontal disease in dogs. methods: seventy-three subgingival samples taken from dogs ranging from 2 months to 12 years (median age 4 years) were tested for red complex bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction assay. results: thirty-six of 73 (49 . 3%) dogs were found to be positive for t. forsythia and p. gingivalis. dogs with gingivitis or periodontitis were more likely to be infected with t. forsythia and p. gingivalis [odds ratio (or) 5 . 4 (confidence interval (ci) 1 . 9-15 . 6), p = 0 . 002] than healthy animals. only 3 (4 . 1%) of 73 samples were positive for red complex bacteria, but the association with periodontal disease was not significant. conclusion and clinical relevance: the results indicate that involvement of red complex bacteria in periodontal disease in dogs is similar to that observed in humans. only the concurrent presence of t. forsythia and p. gingivalis were correlated to periodontal disease in dogs in this study.

AB == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI == interleukin-8 responses of multi-layer gingival epithelia to subgingival biofilms: role of the "red complex" species.
AB == periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease that results in the destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues. the gram-negative anaerobic species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola, (also known as the "red complex" species) are highly associated with subgingival biofilms at periodontitis-affected sites. a major chemokine produced by the gingival epithelium in response to biofilm challenge, is interleukin (il)-8. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the relative effect of the "red complex" species as constituents of subgingival biofilms, on the regulation of il-8 by gingival epithelia. multi-layered organotypic human gingival epithelial cultures were challenged with a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model, or its 7-species variant, excluding the "red complex". il-8 gene expression and secretion analyses were performed by qpcr and elisa, respectively. after 3 h, both biofilms up-regulated il-8 gene expression, but the presence of the "red complex" resulted in 3-fold greater response. il-8 secretion was also up-regulated by both biofilms, with no differences between them. after 24 h, the 10-species biofilm reduced il-8 secretion to 50% of the control, but this was not affected when the "red complex" was absent. in conclusion, as part of biofilms, "red complex" species differentially regulate il-8 in gingival epithelia, potentially affecting the chemotactic responses of the tissue.

AB == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

TI == oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens.
AB == bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete treponema denticola and the gram-negative, proteolytic species porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. these species rely on complex anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit p. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. here, we demonstrate that oxantel inhibited p. gingivalis frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 2.2 mum and planktonic growth of t. forsythia with a mic of 295 mum, but it had no effect on the growth of t. denticola. oxantel treatment caused the downregulation of six p. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. all of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. there was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that p. gingivalis may be unable to overcome frd inhibition. oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. in these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree, demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of t. denticola on the other two species. in a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of p. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.

AB == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI == inter-bacterial correlations in subgingival biofilms: a large-scale survey.
AB == aim: although the complexity of the oral ecology and the ecological differences between health and disease are well accepted, a clear view on the dynamics in relation to disease is lacking. in this study, the prevalence and abundance of 20 key oral bacteria was assessed in health and disease and more importantly a closer look was given to the inter-bacterial relationships. materials and methods: a blinded microbiological database was analysed in this cross-sectional, retrospective study. the database was constructed based on microbiological analyses of samples from 6308 patients, with gradations of periodontitis (healthy to periodontitis). data concerning the abundance of 20 oral bacteria and probing pocket depth were provided. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas micra and porphyromonas intermedia showed a clear increase in abundance and prevalence with increasing pocket depth. correlation matrices illustrated that almost all microorganisms were in one way correlated to other species and most of these correlations were significant. several beneficial bacteria showed strong correlations with other beneficial bacteria. conclusion: knowledge on bacterial correlations can pave the way for new treatment options focusing on restoring the shifted balance.

TI == quantitative analysis of periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of geriatric subjects.
AB == purpose: at present, information regarding periodontal disease in geriatric patients is scarce. the purpose of this study was to quantify the periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of korean geriatric patients and assess the relationship between the bacterial levels and the periodontal condition. methods: six putative periodontal pathogens were quantified by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in geriatric patient groups (>60 years) with mild chronic periodontitis (mcp), moderate chronic periodontitis (mocp), and severe chronic periodontitis (scp). the copy numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia were measured. results: it was found that the bacterial copy numbers increased as the severity of the disease increased from mcp to scp, except for p. intermedia. for p. intermedia, it was found that samples in the mcp group yielded the largest amount. it was also found that the quantities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, the so-called "red complex" bacteria, were lower than those of f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia in all of the samples. conclusions: collectively, the results of this study suggest that the levels of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, f. nucleatum, and t. denticola present in saliva are associated with the severity of periodontal disease in geriatric patients.

TI == the effects of stress hormones on growth of selected periodontitis related bacteria.
AB == the focus of this study was to examine in vitro the effects of stress hormones (catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and hydrocortisone: cortisol) on the growth of four anaerobic species of periodontitis-related bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and one facultative anaerobic species (eikenella corrodens). bacterial growth was determined by two different methods: fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), and the viable count by culture method. to simulate stress, each single strain was grown in a special growth medium with three different concentrations of each hormone, using an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c. growth of f. nucleatum increased in the presence of all stress hormones. growth of p. gingivalis was not significantly influenced by any hormone. growth of p. intermedia and e. corrodens was inhibited by almost all stress hormones tested. both methods of analysis revealed that the highest concentrations of norepinephrine and cortisol increased the growth of t. forsythia. different hormones have a different effect on the growth of periodontitis-related bacteria in vitro. it appears that bacterial viability is more strongly influenced than is bacterial metabolic activity. the growth of f. nucleatum particularly and partially of t. forsythia is increased by several stress hormones and may have an additional negative impact on periodontal disease.

TI == detection of putative periodontopathic bacteria in type 1 diabetic and healthy children: a comparative study.
AB == aim: the aim of this study was to compare and assess the risk of periodontitis due to the presence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) in type 1 diabetic and healthy children. materials and methods: fifty type 1 diabetic and 50 healthy children in the age group of 7-14 years were recruited for the study. subgingival plaque samples collected from permanent first molars were subjected to polymerase chain reaction assay to detect 16s rrna gene of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola and a. actinomycetemcomitans. the data were analyzed using fisher exact test. the p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: the prevalence of subgingival periodontal pathogens in diabetic and healthy children was 2% and 4% for p. gingivalis, 34% and 34% for t. denticola, 20% and 18% for a. actinomycetemcomitans and for t. forsythia, 4% and 34%, respectively. significant statistical difference was not observed with regard to the prevalence of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and a. actinomycetemcomitans among type 1 diabetic and healthy children (p = 1.00). conversely, t. forsythia was less prevalent in diabetic children compared to healthy children. conclusion: statistical significance was not observed for the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in type 1 diabetic subjects. the results of the present study thus reveal the absence of risk of periodontitis by these bacterial species in type 1 diabetic subjects.

TI == protein substrates of a novel secretion system are numerous in the bacteroidetes  phylum and have in common a cleavable c-terminal secretion signal, extensive post-translational modification, and cell-surface attachment.
AB == the secretion of certain proteins in porphyromonas gingivalis is dependent on a c-terminal domain (ctd). after secretion, the ctd is cleaved prior to extensive modification of the mature protein, probably with lipopolysaccharide, therefore enabling attachment to the cell surface. in this study, bioinformatic analyses of the ctd demonstrated the presence of three conserved sequence motifs. these motifs were used to construct hidden markov models (hmms) that predicted 663 ctd-containing proteins in 21 fully sequenced species of the bacteroidetes phylum, while no ctd-containing proteins were predicted in species outside this phylum. further hmm searching of cytophaga hutchinsonii led to a total of 171 predicted ctd proteins in that organism alone. proteomic analyses of membrane fractions and culture fluid derived from p. gingivalis and four other species containing predicted ctds (parabacteroides distasonis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and c. hutchinsonii) demonstrated that membrane localization, extensive post-translational modification, and ctd-cleavage were conserved features of the secretion system. the ctd cleavage site of 10 different proteins from 3 different species was determined and found to be similar to the cleavage site previously determined in p. gingivalis, suggesting that homologues of the c-terminal signal peptidase (pg0026) are responsible for the cleavage in these species.

TI == porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola synergistic polymicrobial biofilm development.
AB == chronic periodontitis has a polymicrobial biofilm aetiology and interactions between key bacterial species are strongly implicated as contributing to disease progression. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia have all been implicated as playing roles in disease progression. p. gingivalis cell-surface-located protease/adhesins, the gingipains, have been suggested to be involved in its interactions with several other bacterial species. the aims of this study were to determine polymicrobial biofilm formation by p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia, as well as the role of p. gingivalis gingipains in biofilm formation by using a gingipain null triple mutant. to determine homotypic and polymicrobial biofilm formation a flow cell system was employed and the biofilms imaged and quantified by fluorescent in situ hybridization using dna species-specific probes and confocal scanning laser microscopy imaging. of the three species, only p. gingivalis and t. denticola formed mature, homotypic biofilms, and a strong synergy was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilm formation. this synergy was demonstrated by significant increases in biovolume, average biofilm thickness and maximum biofilm thickness of both species. in addition there was a morphological change of t. denticola in polymicrobial biofilms when compared with homotypic biofilms, suggesting reduced motility in homotypic biofilms. p. gingivalis gingipains were shown to play an essential role in synergistic polymicrobial biofilm formation with t. denticola.

AB == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

AB == periodontitis is a common problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (dm), however, differences in the putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with dm compared to non-dm subjects are still inconclusive. the red complex, which includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease. the aim of the present study was to compare cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t. forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in gingival sulcus of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites of non-diabetes mellitus (ndm), controlled and poorly controlled insulin-dependent dm (cdm and pdm) patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 cdm, 19 pdm and 19 ndm patients. taqman real time-pcr was used to determine bacterial cell number. at subject level, the quantity of red complex bacteria was significantly higher in pdm than those of ndm and positively correlated with hba1c. at site level (total 342 sites), cell numbers of t. denticola and t. forsythia in healthy sites of cdm and pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm. in gingivitis sites, the numbers of p. gingivalis in cdm and pdm and t. forsythia in pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm while in periodontitis sites, higher quantity of p. gingivalis in pdm was observed. our study indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with increasing cell numbers of red complex bacteria in subgingival biofilm.

TI == periodontopathogens levels and clinical response to periodontal therapy in individuals with the interleukin-4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
AB == periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results from an interaction between dental biofilm agents and the host immune-inflammatory response. periodontopathogenic organisms, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, as well as the host's susceptibility, represented by the host's genetic makeup, are the key factors that influence this complex disease. recently, we identified haplotypes in the il4 gene that were associated with chronic periodontitis (cp). this study aimed to evaluate whether subjects with different il4 haplotypes (tci/cci and ttd/cti) would be differentially colonized by periodontopathogens and whether they would respond differently to non-surgical periodontal therapy. thirty-nine patients carrying the il4 haplotype of genetic susceptibility to cp (il4+) or protection against cp (il4-) were evaluated. those groups were further subdivided into individuals with cp (cp il4+ or cp il4-) and those that were periodontally healthy (h) (h il4+ or h il4-). cp patients were submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy. clinical and microbiological analyses were performed considering the data at baseline and 45 and 90 days after periodontal therapy. periodontopathogens levels were evaluated by absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). the baseline data revealed that the total levels of periodontopathogens were higher in the cp il4+ than in the cp il4- groups. clinical analyses revealed that the periodontal therapy was equally effective, independent of the subject's il4 genetic load. the tci/cci il4 haplotype, previously associated with genetic susceptibility to cp, was also associated with increased levels of periodontopathogenic bacteria, but this genetic background did not influence the response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

AB == purpose: to analyze the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics (interleukins 1beta and 6) in the peri-implant sulcus fluid (pisf) of patients with healthy dental implants and with peri-implant mucositis. materials and methods: clinical parameters (modified gingival index [mgi], modified plaque index [mpi], probing pocket depth [ppd], and absence or presence of radiologic bone loss) were recorded, and pisf samples were obtained from peri-implant sites showing mucositis as well as healthy sites. the periodontopathogenic bacteria tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were evaluated, together with the total bacterial load (tbl) and the interleukin (il) 1beta and il-6 values. results: the study population consisted of 34 individuals, and 77 dental implants were evaluated during the study (23 mucositis and 54 healthy peri-implant sites). the mgi, mpi, and ppd scores of the peri-implant mucositis group were significantly greater than in the healthy group. no differences in detection frequency were found for putative periodontal pathogens and tbl between the healthy peri-implant sites and mucositis sites. the mucositis group showed a significantly greater expression of il-6 than the healthy group (p < .05). although il-1beta was increased in the mucositis group, there was no statistically significant difference versus the healthy implant group. conclusions: an analysis was made of the clinical, microbiologic, and host response characteristics in implants with peri-implant mucositis, establishing comparisons with healthy implants. in the patients studied, bacterial plaque induced an inflammatory response that can lead to the development of peri-implant mucositis. adequate plaque control is therefore able to increase peri-implant health, avoiding the risk of future complications. no specific association to the studied bacterial species was established.

AB == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp) and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI == isolation of treponema and tannerella spp. from equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis related periodontal disease.
AB == reasons for performing study: red complex bacteria, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, are involved in the onset and progression of periodontal disease in man, yet seldom inhabit the oral cavity of healthy individuals. periodontal disease is also encountered in horses, with equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (eotrh) constituting a particular form of disease. however, only little is known about the oral microbiome of healthy and periodontitis-affected equids. objective: we aimed to test the hypothesis that red complex bacteria are also associated with eotrh-related periodontal disease. study design: controlled cross-sectional study. methods: we screened dna purified from crevicular fluid derived from 23 eotrh-affected and 21 disease-free horses for the presence of treponema spp., tannerella spp. and porphyromonas gingivalis dna by polymerase chain reaction. subsequently, amplified dna was bidirectionally sequenced and identified via blast analysis. results: treponema and/or tannerella dna was detected in 100% of periodontitis-related samples and in 52.2% of dna derived from healthy horses. twenty-six amplicon sequences were 98-100% homologous to published bacterial sequences, which mostly corresponded to treponema pectinovorum, oral treponema clones ju025 and omz 840, and tannerella forsythia. p. gingivalis dna was only found in 3 eotrh-related samples. forty-three amplicon sequences revealed weaker homologies ranging between 80% and 97% to known treponema or tannerella strains, partly because of their heterogeneity, partly because they obviously represented so far unknown types. conclusions: this is the first report in which known and novel treponema and tannerella spp. were isolated in association with eotrh-related periodontal disease.

TI == rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease caused by periodontal pathogens.
AB == a statistically significant association between periodontal disease (pd) and systemic diseases has been identified. rheumatoid arthritis (ra), which is a chronic inflammatory joint disease, exhibits similar characteristics and pathogenesis to pd. the association between ra and pd has been investigated, and numerous publications on this subject exist. approximately 20 bacterial species have been identified as periodontal pathogens, and these organisms are linked to various types of pd. the most analyzed species of periodontopathic bacteria are porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. antibodies and dna from these oral pathogens have been isolated from the sera and synovial fluids of ra patients. this rapid communication describes the role of periodontal pathogens in the etiopathogenesis of ra.

TI == photodynamic therapy in the treatment of class ii furcation: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB == aim: to investigate the effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) as adjunct to mechanical therapy in furcations. materials and methods: a double-blind, parallel, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in subjects presenting class ii furcations. the subjects were randomly allocated to a test (pdt; n = 16) or control group (non-activated laser/only photosensitizer; n = 21). at baseline, 3 and 6 months, clinical, microbiological and cytokine pattern evaluation was performed. clinical attachment level was defined as the primary outcome variable. results: clinical parameters improved after both therapies (p < 0.05) with no differences between groups at any time point (p > 0.05). at 6 months, real-time pcr evaluation showed a decrease in porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia only in the pdt group (p < 0.05) with no inter-group differences. regarding cytokines, il-4 and il-10 levels increased in both groups at 6 months. gm-csf, il-8, il-1beta and il-6 levels decreased only in the pdt group after 3 months (p < 0.05). at 3 months, inter-group analyses showed that gm-csf, ifn-gamma, il-6 and il-8 levels were lower in the pdt group. at 6 months, lower il-1beta levels were also observed in the pdt group (p < 0.05). conclusion: photodynamic therapy did not promote clinical benefits for class ii furcations; however, advantages in local levels of cytokines and a reduction in periodontopathogens were demonstrated.

TI == gingipain-dependent degradation of mammalian target of rapamycin pathway proteins by the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis during invasion.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are gram-negative pathogens strongly associated with periodontitis. their abilities to interact, invade and persist within host cells are considered crucial to their pathogenicity, but the mechanisms by which they subvert host defences are not well understood. in this study, we set out to investigate whether p. gingivalis and t. forsythia directly target key signalling molecules that may modulate the host cell phenotype to favour invasion and persistence. our data identify, for the first time, that p. gingivalis, but not t. forsythia, reduces levels of intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) in oral epithelial cells following invasion over a 4-h time course, via the action of gingipains. the ability of cytochalasin d to abrogate p. gingivalis-mediated mtor degradation suggests that this effect is dependent upon cellular invasion. we also show that levels of several other proteins in the mtor signalling pathway are modulated by gingipains, either directly or as a consequence of mtor degradation including p-4e-bp1. taken together, our data suggest that p. gingivalis manipulates the mtor pathway, providing evidence for a potentially novel mechanism by which p. gingivalis mediates its effects on host cell responses to infection.

TI == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and toll-like receptor 2 are associated with hypertensive disorders in placental tissue: a case-control study.
AB == aim(s): to explore the associations between the presence of periodontal pathogens and the expression of toll-like receptors (tlr-2 and tlr-4) in the placental tissue of patients with hypertensive disorders compared to the placentas of healthy normotensive patients. material and methods: a case-control study was performed. from a cohort composed of 126 pregnant women, 33 normotensive healthy pregnant women were randomly selected, and 25 cases of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, were selected. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of delivery. all of the samples were processed and analysed for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. determination of the expressions of tlr-2 and tlr-4 was performed in samples of total purified protein isolated from placental tissues and analysed by elisa. the data were assessed using descriptive statistics. the associations among variables were estimated through multiple logistic regression models and the mann-whitney test to evaluate the differences between the two groups. results: a significant increase was observed in the expression of tlr-2 in the placentas of patients with hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04). additionally, the multiple logistic regression models demonstrated an association between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis in placental tissues and hypertensive disorders (or: 9.39, p = 0.001, ci 95% 2.39-36.88 and or: 7.59, p = 0.019, ci 95% 1.39-41.51, respectively). conclusions: in the present study, pregnant women with periodontal disease presented an association in the placental tissue between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis and hypertensive disorders. additionally, increased expression of tlr-2 was observed. however, further studies are required to determine the specific roles of periodontal pathogens and tlrs in the placental tissue of patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.

AB == objective: the present clinical trial was designed to investigate the effectiveness of systemic satranidazole (sz) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. methods: sixty-six subjects presenting with at least twelve teeth with probing depth (pd) > or = 4 mm were selected. thirty-three subjects were randomly assigned to full-mouth srp + placebo (group 1) and 33 subjects were assigned to full-mouth srp + sz (group 2). the clinical outcomes evaluated were plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), clinical attachment level (cal) and pd at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. also, microbial analysis of dental plaque using polymerase chain reaction was done at baseline, 3 and 6 months to estimate the number of sites harboring periodontopathogens. results: sixty subjects were evaluated up to 6 months. at 6 months, group 2 showed greater mean reduction (3.84 +/- 1.31 mm) in pd as compared to group 1 (1.42 +/- 1.01 mm; p < 0.05) and there was a greater mean cal gain (3.22 +/- 1.01 mm) in group 2 as compared to group 1 (1.15 +/- 1.49 mm; p < 0.05). these subjects also showed significant reductions in the number of certain periodontopathogens, such as tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: the systemic use of sz, when used as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy in subjects with periodontitis, achieves significantly better clinical and microbiological results than scaling and root planing alone.

AB == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials, antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

TI == determining the presence of periodontopathic virulence factors in short-term postmortem alzheimer's disease brain tissue.

TI == association between periodontal disease and plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.
AB == objective: untreated periodontal disease seems to cause low grade systemic inflammation and blood lipid alteration leading to increased cardiovascular disease risk. to start testing this hypothesis in colombian patients, a multicentre study was conducted including the three main state capitals: bogota, medellin and cali. methods: in this study 192 (28.4%) advanced and 256 (37.8%) moderate periodontitis patients were investigated for socio-demographic variables, city of precedence, periodontal parameters, smoking, red complex periodontopathic bacteria, serum antibodies against porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and blood lipids including total cholesterol, hdl, ldl and triglycerides (tg). those parameters were compared to 229 (33.8%) controls having periodontal health or gingivitis. results: advanced periodontitis had worst periodontal indexes, than moderate periodontitis and controls. interestingly, higher hdl and tg levels were present in periodontitis. bmi <30 and smoking were associated with increased hdl, hdl-35, ldl and tg, while glycemia >100 mg/dl associated with hdl, hdl-35 and tg. tannerella forsythia showed a significant association with hdl-35 in bivariate analysis and serum igg1 against p. gingivalis associated with hdl-35 and serum igg1 against t. forsythia associated with tg and serum igg2 against a. actinomycetemcomitans correlated with levels of hdl y hdl-35. in logistic regression the periodontitis patients from cali presented reduced hdl levels as compared to bogota and medellin patients. presence of igg1 antibodies against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans correlated with reduced hdl levels. conclusion: this study confirmed that untreated periodontitis generates alteration in serum lipid levels and systemic bacterial exposure against important periodontopathic bacteria could be the biological link.

AB == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with peri-implantitis.

TI == subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associates with the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB == aim: we investigated the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. materials and methods: the cross-sectional study population (n = 445) comprised 171 (38.4%) patients with stable cad, 158 (35.5%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs) and 116 (26.1%) with no significant cad (no cad). all patients participated in clinical and radiological oral health examinations. pooled subgingival bacterial samples were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assays. results: in all study groups, the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola indicated a significant (p </= 0.001) linear association with the extent of alveolar bone loss (abl), but a. actinomycetemcomitans did not (p = 0.074). with a threshold level of bacterial cells 1 x 10(5) a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent in the stable cad group (42.1%) compared to the no cad group (30.2%) (p = 0.040). in a multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis using this threshold, a. actinomycetemcomitans positivity associated with stable cad (or 1.83, 95% ci 1.00-3.35, p = 0.049), but its level or levels of other bacteria did not. conclusions: the presence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans associates with an almost twofold risk of stable cad independently of alveolar bone loss.

TI == polymicrobial infection with major periodontal pathogens induced periodontal disease and aortic atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic apoe(null) mice.
AB == periodontal disease (pd) and atherosclerosis are both polymicrobial and multifactorial and although observational studies supported the association, the causative relationship between these two diseases is not yet established. polymicrobial infection-induced periodontal disease is postulated to accelerate atherosclerotic plaque growth by enhancing atherosclerotic risk factors of orally infected apolipoprotein e deficient (apoe(null)) mice. at 16 weeks of infection, samples of blood, mandible, maxilla, aorta, heart, spleen, and liver were collected, analyzed for bacterial genomic dna, immune response, inflammation, alveolar bone loss, serum inflammatory marker, atherosclerosis risk factors, and aortic atherosclerosis. pcr analysis of polymicrobial-infected (porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], treponema denticola [t. denticola], and tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia]) mice resulted in detection of bacterial genomic dna in oral plaque samples indicating colonization of the oral cavity by all three species. fluorescent in situ hybridization detected p. gingivalis and t. denticola within gingival tissues of infected mice and morphometric analysis showed an increase in palatal alveolar bone loss (p<0.0001) and intrabony defects suggesting development of periodontal disease in this model. polymicrobial-infected mice also showed an increase in aortic plaque area (p<0.05) with macrophage accumulation, enhanced serum amyloid a, and increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides. a systemic infection was indicated by the detection of bacterial genomic dna in the aorta and liver of infected mice and elevated levels of bacterial specific igg antibodies (p<0.0001). this study was a unique effort to understand the effects of a polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia on periodontal disease and associated atherosclerosis in apoe(null) mice.

TI == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

AB == objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque collected at different probing depths of type 1 diabetes patients with periodontal disease in correlation to metabolic control. methods: twenty-one patients 40 to 50 years old were included in the study. in each patient blood samples were taken for the evaluation of hba1c level and subgingival plaque samples were taken with paper points from the two deepest pockets. the presence of five periodontal pathogens was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: the results of 38 plaque samples showed that t. forsythia was found in 48% followed by t. denticola in 31%, p. gingivalis in 26%, p. intermedia in 9% and a. actinomycetemcomitans in 7%. t. forsythia and t. denticola were the most frequent combination of periodontal pathogens found in the same sample. the serum level of hba1c in nine patients where t. forsythia was detected (7.5 +/- 1.4%) was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) than in 12 patients where t. forsythia was not detected (6.8 +/- 0.5%). similarly, the serum level of hba1c was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) in eight patients where t. denticola was detected (7.5 +/- 1.8%) compared to the 13 patients where t. denticola was not detected (7.0 +/- 0.5%). no such correlation was found for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia or a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: we conclude that t. forsythia and t. denticola are most frequently found in subgingival plaque samples of type 1 diabetic patients and these findings correlate with poorer metabolic control of diabetes.

TI == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

AB == numerous publications have reported the presence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in peripheral and central vascular lesions. however, it is unclear how this bacterial translocation occurs. the objective of this study was to investigate whether periodontopathic bacteria are translocated to lymph nodes proximal to the oral cavity. obtaining lymph node samples is not ethically feasible unless they are excised as part of the surgical management of patients with cancer. this study analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes, histologically negative for cancer cell invasion, that were excised from 66 patients with histories of head and neck cancer. real-time pcr was performed to amplify the 16s ribosomal dna fragments from porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. the relationship between bacterial detection and cancer severity, gender, and the use of anti-cancer therapy was examined by fisher's exact test. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. intermedia were present in 17%, 8%, and 8% of the samples of submandibular and submental lymph nodes, respectively. there were no significant relationships between bacterial detection and the cancer disease status, patient gender or use of anticancer therapy. according to these data, it appears that the translocation of periodontopathic bacteria may occur via lymphatic drainage, irrespective of the cancer disease status, gender or anticancer therapy.

AB == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67% of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI == prediction of periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque of periodontal healthy subjects by measurement of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air.
AB == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. for this purpose, we assessed the relationships among distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including vsc concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. methods: the subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5+/-2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. after vsc concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (halimeter((r))), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. the tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. the colonization of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. results: significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of p. gingivalis. vsc concentration showed the most significant association with colonization of p. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [exp(b)] values for vsc concentration with the colonization of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. in addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [exp(b)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (lr) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. conclusion: the present results demonstrated that measurement of vsc concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.

TI == modeling susceptibility to periodontitis.
AB == chronic inflammatory diseases like periodontitis have a complex pathogenesis and  a multifactorial etiology, involving complex interactions between multiple genetic loci and infectious agents. we aimed to investigate the influence of genetic polymorphisms and bacteria on chronic periodontitis risk. we determined the prevalence of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in immune response candidate genes and 7 bacterial species of potential relevance to periodontitis etiology, in chronic periodontitis patients and non-periodontitis control individuals (n = 385). using decision tree analysis, we identified the presence of bacterial species tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and snps tnf -857 and il-1a -889 as discriminators between periodontitis and non-periodontitis. the model reached an accuracy of 80%, sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 73%, and auc of 73%. this pilot study shows that, on the basis of 3 periodontal pathogens and snps, patterns may be recognized to identify patients at risk for periodontitis. modern bioinformatics tools are valuable in modeling the multifactorial and complex nature of periodontitis.

TI == reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB == objective: salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. salivary arginase activity (saa) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the saa before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. method and materials: eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. salivary total protein level and saa were also established by spectrophotometry. clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the wilcoxon, mann-withney, and kruskal-wallis tests (p < .05). for microbial data, the chi-square test was used. the pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. results: after therapy, due to a significant reduction in saa, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found in the healthy group. interestingly, after therapy, saa followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group t forsythia, pre- > posttherapy; periodontitis group p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). conclusion: based on the reduction of saa after therapy, in accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters, it was concluded that saa has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

TI == quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in saliva using the invader assay.
AB == when quantifying periodontopathic bacteria, it is important to use a convenient method that does not produce false negative results. the invader assay is a convenient method because it does not involve gene amplification. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of the invader assay to quantify periodontopathic bacteria. the invader technology was applied in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola). the invader assay produced a linear quantitative detection range over concentrations spanning seven exponential values, with a detection limit of 10(3.7) copies/tube and intra-day and inter-day variance of 0.1% to 4.7% and 0.1% to 3.4%, respectively, in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria. we compared the results of the invader assay with those of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed for quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria in 22 patients with periodontitis. among the invader-detectable bacterial strains of each species, significant correlations were observed in the counts of concerned bacterial species between these two methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.757 to 0.996. this study validated repeatability and reproducibility of the invader assay in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria and demonstrated consistent agreement between the invader assay and real-time pcr in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria.

TI == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species. statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

TI == bacterial community shift in treated periodontitis patients revealed by ion torrent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing.
AB == periodontitis, one of the most common diseases in the world, is caused by a mixture of pathogenic bacteria and inflammatory host responses and often treated by antimicrobials as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). our study aims to elucidate explorative and descriptive temporal shifts in bacterial communities between patients treated by srp alone versus srp plus antibiotics. this is the first metagenomic study using an ion torrent personal genome machine (pgm). eight subgingival plaque samples from four patients with chronic periodontitis, taken before and two months after intervention were analyzed. amplicons from the v6 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene were generated and sequenced each on a 314 chip. sequencing reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (otus, 3% distance), described by community metrics, and taxonomically classified. reads ranging from 599,933 to 650,416 per sample were clustered into 1,648 to 2,659 non-singleton otus, respectively. increased diversity (shannon and simpson) in all samples after therapy was observed regardless of the treatment type whereas richness (ace) showed no correlation. taxonomic analysis revealed different microbial shifts between both therapy approaches at all taxonomic levels. most remarkably, the genera porphyromonas, tannerella, treponema, and filifactor all harboring periodontal pathogenic species were removed almost only in the group treated with spr and antibiotics. for the species t. forsythia and p. gingivalis results were corroborated by real-time pcr analysis. in the future, hypothesis free metagenomic analysis could be the key in understanding polymicrobial diseases and be used for therapy monitoring. therefore, as read length continues to increase and cost to decrease, rapid benchtop sequencers like the pgm might finally be used in routine diagnostic.

AB == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia exist in  a polymicrobial biofilm associated with chronic periodontitis. the aim of this study was to culture these three species as a polymicrobial biofilm and to determine proteins important for bacterial interactions. in a flow cell all three species attached and grew as a biofilm; however, after 90 h of culture p. gingivalis and t. denticola were closely associated and dominated the polymicrobial biofilm. for comparison, planktonic cultures of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were grown separately in continuous culture. whole cell lysates were subjected to sds-page, followed by in-gel proteolytic h(2)(1)(6)o/h(2)(1)(8)o labeling. from two replicates, 135 and 174 p. gingivalis proteins and 134 and 194 t. denticola proteins were quantified by lc-maldi tof/tof ms. the results suggest a change of strategy in iron acquisition by p. gingivalis due to large increases in the abundance of husa and husb in the polymicrobial biofilm while hmuy and other iron/haem transport systems decreased. significant changes in the abundance of peptidases and enzymes involved in glutamate and glycine catabolism suggest syntrophy. these data indicate an intimate association between p. gingivalis and t. denticola in a biofilm that may play a role in disease pathogenesis.

AB == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI == co-localized or randomly distributed? pair cross correlation of in vivo grown subgingival biofilm bacteria quantified by digital image analysis.
AB == the polymicrobial nature of periodontal diseases is reflected by the diversity of phylotypes detected in subgingival plaque and the finding that consortia of suspected pathogens rather than single species are associated with disease development. a number of these microorganisms have been demonstrated in vitro to interact and enhance biofilm integration, survival or even pathogenic features. to examine the in vivo relevance of these proposed interactions, we extended the spatial arrangement analysis tool of the software daime (digital image analysis in microbial ecology). this modification enabled the quantitative analysis of microbial co-localization in images of subgingival biofilm species, where the biomass was confined to fractions of the whole-image area, a situation common for medical samples. selected representatives of the disease-associated red and orange complexes that were previously suggested to interact with each other in vitro (tannerella forsythia with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis with prevotella intermedia) were chosen for analysis and labeled with specific fluorescent probes via fluorescence in situ hybridization. pair cross-correlation analysis of in vivo grown biofilms revealed tight clustering of f. nucleatum/periodonticum and t. forsythia at short distances (up to 6 microm) with a pronounced peak at 1.5 microm. while these results confirmed previous in vitro observations for f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, random spatial distribution was detected between p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the in vivo samples. in conclusion, we successfully employed spatial arrangement analysis on the single cell level in clinically relevant medical samples and demonstrated the utility of this approach for the in vivo validation of in vitro observations by analyzing statistically relevant numbers of different patients. more importantly, the culture-independent nature of this approach enables similar quantitative analyses for "as-yet-uncultured" phylotypes which cannot be characterized in vitro.

TI == does periodontopathic bacterial infection contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis?
AB == there is a significant association between rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and periodontal disease (pd). patients with longstanding active ra have been found to have a substantially increased frequency of pd compared with healthy subjects. further, patients with pd have been shown to have a higher prevalence of ra than patients without periodontitis. antibodies to gram-negative, anaerobic periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and tannerella forsythia have been detected in the serum and synovial fluid of ra patients. these pathogens have also been identified in the synovial fluid of ra patients, with higher levels of bacterial dna in ra patients than in controls. this review examines the association between periodontopathic bacteria and the etiology of ra.

TI == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

TI == subgingival microbial profiles as diagnostic markers of destructive periodontal diseases: a clinical epidemiology study.
AB == aims: to describe the subgingival microbial profiles of the major putative periodontal pathogens and investigate their role as diagnostic markers for destructive periodontal diseases in an untreated and isolated population. materials and methods: the source population consisted of all subjects aged >/= 12 years in an isolated brazilian population. an interview and a full-mouth clinical examination were conducted and subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites per subject. pcr analyses were used to identify the following micro-organisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. results: among the 214 clinically examined subjects (81% response), 170 of the 195 dentate subjects provided plaque samples. two subgingival microbial profiles were identified: absence of all micro-organisms but campylobacter rectus or co-occurrence of tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis. using a combination of microbiological and interview information, the smallest overall misclassification in the diagnosis of extensive clinical attachment loss >/= 5 mm was 8.8% (4.7% of non-cases and 22% of cases), but this was not different from the 7.6% (2.3% non-cases and 24.4% cases) obtained using clinical and interview information (p = 0.292). conclusion: specific microbial profiles could be identified in this isolated population. they did not result in significant superior diagnostic accuracy when compared to traditional clinical markers.

TI == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1), severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages of periodontitis.

TI == prevalence of periodontopathogens in a black brazilian secluded community matched with a black urban population.
AB == objective: to evaluate the prevalence of periodontopathogens according to periodontal profile in a black brazilian secluded community matched with an urban black population. participants: a total of 84 subjects were selected, 42 (mean age 25.7 sd 18.0 years) from a secluded community called santo antonio do guapore (sag) and 42 (mean age 25.4 sd 18.1 years) from an urban area of sao paulo state (spt). methods: participants received clinical examinations as follows: periodontal pocket depth; clinical attachment loss; plaque and gingival indexes. after examination, the secluded population was classified as periodontal health (13), gingivitis (15) or periodontitis (14). then, 182 urban volunteers were screened and 42 subjects were selected matched for the variables: periodontal diagnosis, age (+/- 2 years) and gender. samples were taken for microbial analysis. genomic dna for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia was provided by polymerase chain reaction. results: except for c. rectus, all pathogens were present in both groups with no statistically significant difference. in particular, c. rectus was more prevalent only in gingivitis subjects from the spt group (p<0.05). a high frequency of periodontopathogens was related to the severity of periodontal disease. conclusion: in general, the prevalence of the examined periodontopathogens in this study did not differ between a secluded black brazilian population and an urban black population.

TI == the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of one-stage, full-mouth, ultrasonic debridement in aggressive periodontitis treatment.
AB == background: the aim of the present study is to assess clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic benefits of amoxicillin/metronidazole (am) when performing full-mouth ultrasonic debridement (fmud) in generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) treatment. methods: twenty-four gagp patients were divided into two groups: the fmud group (n = 12), which received fmud plus placebo, and the fmud+am group (n = 12), which received fmud and 375 mg amoxicillin plus 250 mg metronidazole for 7 days. the following clinical outcomes were tested: plaque and bleeding on probing indices, pocket probing depth (pd), relative gingival margin position (gmp), and relative clinical attachment level (cal). total amount of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) concentration of interleukin (il)-10 and il-1beta were also determined. all clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-therapy. the anova/tukey test was used for statistical analysis (alpha = 5%). results: amoxicillin/metronidazole used as an adjunct to the fmud protocol added clinical and microbiologic benefits to gagp treatment (p <0.05). fmud+am groups presented an additional pd reduction in initially deep pds at the 3-month follow-up (3.99 +/- 1.16 mm and 3.09 +/- 0.78 mm for fmud+am and fmud, respectively; p <0.05), a lower number of residual pockets at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, and a statistical reduction in amounts of aa (p <0.05). analysis of tf and pg amounts, as well as il-10 and il-1beta gcf concentrations failed to demonstrate a difference between the groups (p >0.05). conclusion: it may be concluded that amoxicillin/metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of fmud in gagp treatment.

TI == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78 species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI == porphyromonas endodontalis in chronic periodontitis: a clinical and microbiological cross-sectional study.
AB == background: although previous studies have shown the presence of porphyromonas endodontalis in chronic periodontitis associated with periapical lesions, the occurrence of this pathogen in diseased periodontal sites without periapical lesions has been poorly investigated. objective: the aims of this study were to quantify p. endodontalis in patients with chronic periodontitis without periapical lesions, to evaluate the potential correlation of p. endodontalis with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and to evaluate the ability of periodontal treatment to reduce these pathogens. design: patients with generalized chronic periodontitis were selected by recording clinical attachment level (cal), probing depth (pd), and bleeding on probing (bop). subgingival samples from 30 diseased nonadjacent sites (cal>/=5 mm, pd between 5 and 7 mm and positive bop) and 30 healthy nonadjacent sites (pd</=3 mm and negative bop) were collected and subjected to microbial analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) the variables of age, pd, cal and bop of all individuals were analyzed using the paired t-test (grappad prism5((r))). data of bacteria quantification were subjected to a normality test (d'agostino-pearson test). for bacterial correlation analysis, the spearman correlation was used. results: our results showed that diseased sites had significantly higher levels of p. endodontalis compared to healthy sites, similar to the results obtained for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. the numbers of all bacterial species were reduced significantly after mechanical periodontal treatment. p. endodontalis was significantly correlated with the presence of t. forsythia and p. gingivalis in the diseased group. conclusion: our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis and t. forsythia in periodontitis sites and that mechanical periodontal treatment is effective at reducing the pathogens studied.

TI == periodontal pathogens affect the level of protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB == in periodontitis, an effective host-response is primarily related to neutrophils  loaded with serine proteases, including elastase (ne) and protease 3 (pr3), the extracellular activity of which is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors. in vitro these inhibitors are degraded by gingipains, cysteine proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis. the purpose of this study was to determine the level of selected protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in relation to periodontal infection. the gcf collected from 31 subjects (nine healthy controls, seven with gingivitis, five with aggressive periodontitis and 10 with chronic periodontitis) was analyzed for the levels of elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), two main tissue-derived inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases. in parallel, activity of ne, pr3 and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps) in gcf was measured. finally loads of p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were determined. the highest values of elafin were found in aggressive periodontitis and the lowest in controls. the quantity of elafin correlated positively with the load of p. gingivalis, ta. forsythia and tr. denticola, as well as with rgps activity. in addition, ne activity was positively associated with the counts of those bacterial species, but not with the amount of elafin. in contrast, the highest concentrations of slpi were found in periodontally healthy subjects whereas amounts of this inhibitor were significantly decreased in patients infected with p. gingivalis. periodontopathogenic bacteria stimulate the release of ne and pr3, which activities escape the control through degradation of locally produced inhibitors (slpi and elafin) by host-derived and bacteria-derived proteases.

TI == evidence for graft colonization with periodontal pathogens in lung transplant recipients. a pilot study.
AB == bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos) is a major cause of late graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. there is increasing evidence that beside alloimmunologic injury also non-alloimmunologic inflammatory conditions may raise the risk of acute and chronic rejection. the oral cavity represents a possible reservoir for pathogenic bacteria due to its close anatomical proximity. in this pilot study, the presence of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in the oral cavity as well as in the lungs of lung transplant recipients was investigated for the first time. eight lung transplant recipients underwent broncho-alveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, and endobronchial biopsies. in addition to routinely performed examinations, pulmonary as well as plaque samples were assessed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and treponema denticola (td) with the aid of a hybridization technique. no or only one periodontal pathogen (solitarily pg) was found in the gingival plaques of five of the eight patients (group a). in three patients, two or more periodontal pathogens were detetectable in the gingival samples (group b). whereas group a also had not more than one periodontal pathogen in the lungs, group b had more than one species in the lungs. in group b, all patients suffered from bos, whereas in group a only one patient was affected. this is the first evidence for the presence of periodontal pathogens in the lungs of lung transplant recipients. further studies with larger cohorts are required to elucidate potential links between periodontal infection, pulmonary colonization, and rejection.

TI == trefoil factors in saliva and gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB == background: trefoil factors (tffs) are secreted molecules that are involved in cytoprotection against tissue damage and the immune response. tffs have been detected in saliva and oral tissues, but their clinical significance has never been investigated in patients with chronic periodontitis. the objective of this study is to determine whether tff expression in saliva and gingival tissues is associated with periodontal pathology. methods: saliva and gingival tissue samples were collected from 25 non-periodontitis individuals and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical methods were used to evaluate the expression of tffs (tff1, tff2, and tff3) in saliva and gingival tissues, respectively. periodontopathic bacteria were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: reduced salivary tff1 and tff3 concentrations were observed in patients with cp (p = 0.003 and p <0.001, respectively). decreased tff3 expression in gingival tissues of patients with cp was demonstrated (p = 0.041). levels of salivary tff3 concentrations were negatively correlated with periodontal pathology and number of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (formerly known as bacteroides forsythus). conclusions: altered expression of tffs in saliva and gingival tissues was detected in patients with cp. the results suggest that tff3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

TI == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

TI == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however, when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

AB == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

AB == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI == microbiologic findings 1 year after partial- and full-mouth scaling in the treatment of moderate chronic periodontitis.
AB == objective: to investigate the impact on microbiologic variables of full-mouth scaling (fms) and conventional scaling and root planing (csrp) after 12 months. method and materials: in a prospective randomized controlled clinical study, 37 volunteers with moderate chronic periodontitis were treated by fms or by csrp in two sessions at 4-week intervals. clinical attachment level, probing depth, and bleeding on probing were recorded at baseline as well as at 6 and 12 months. four subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest sites in premolars and molars at baseline and after 12 months. pooled sample analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction for the identification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, the bacterial load of a actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in the csrp group compared to the fms group (p = .042). in the csrp group, this load decreased significantly (p = .011), leading to similar quantities of a actinomycetemcomitans in both groups. further, significant reductions in frequency were found in the fms group for t forsythia and p gingivalis and in the csrp group for a actinomycetemcomitans and t denticola. conclusion: the data suggest that both therapy modalities lead to similar effects on target periodontal pathogen species. fms compared to csrp was not favorable in reduction of periodontopathogens.

TI == polymicrobial periodontal pathogen transcriptomes in calvarial bone and soft tissue.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are consistently associated with adult periodontitis. this study sought to document the host transcriptome to a p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t.forsythia challenge as a polymicrobial infection using a murine calvarial model of acute inflammation and bone resorption. mice were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia over the calvaria, after which the soft tissues and calvarial bones were excised. a murine genechip((r)) array analysis of transcript profiles showed that 6997 genes were differentially expressed in calvarial bones (p < 0.05) and 1544 genes were differentially transcribed in the inflamed tissues after the polymicrobial infection. of these genes, 4476 and 1035 genes in the infected bone and tissues were differentially expressed by upregulation. biological pathways significantly impacted by the polymicrobial infection in calvarial bone included leukocyte transendothelial migration (ltm), cell adhesion molecules, adherens junction, major histocompatibility complex antigen, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and antigen processing and presentation resulting in inflammatory/cytokine/chemokine transcripts stimulation in bone and soft tissue. intense inflammation and increased activated osteoclasts were observed in calvarias compared with sham-infected controls. quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis confirmed that the mrna level of selected genes corresponded with the microarray expression. the polymicrobial infection regulated several ltm and extracellular membrane pathway genes in a manner distinct from mono-infection with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia. to our knowledge, this is the first definition of the polymicrobially induced transcriptome in calvarial bone and soft tissue in response to periodontal pathogens.

TI == levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

TI == randomized controlled trial assessing efficacy and safety of glycine powder air polishing in moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets.
AB == background: supragingivally applied glycine powder air polishing (supragpap) has  been shown to remove biofilms in shallow periodontal pockets. this study assesses efficacy and safety of subgingivally applied glycine powder air polishing (subgpap) in moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets. methods: patients with chronic periodontitis and intraoral porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and tannerella forsythia who completed initial therapy were randomly assigned to receive subgpap in periodontal pockets with probing depths of 4 to 9 mm, supragpap in all other shallow periodontal sites, and at mucous membranes followed by removal of calculus using curets (full-mouth gpap) or scaling and root planing followed by coronal polishing (srp). patients rinsed with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate after debridement, and twice daily, for 2 weeks. results: all 30 patients enrolled completed the baseline, day 10, and day 90 visits. subgpap resulted in significantly lower total viable bacterial counts in moderate-to-deep pockets when compared to srp immediately after debridement and at day 10 (p <0.05). total p. gingivalis counts in the oral cavity were significantly reduced after full-mouth gpap compared to srp at day 90 (p <0.05). patients' comfort levels were high for both treatments. there were no adverse events related to full-mouth gpap. conclusions: the results indicate that subgpap is more efficacious in removing subgingival biofilm in moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets than srp. furthermore, full-mouth gpap may result in a beneficial shift of the oral microbiota and appears to be well tolerated.

TI == tlr2 signaling and th2 responses drive tannerella forsythia-induced periodontal bone loss.
AB == periodontal disease (pd) is a chronic inflammation of the tooth-supporting soft tissue and alveolar bone due to infection by a select group of gram-negative microbes, which leads to tooth loss if untreated. because mice deficient in cd4(+) cells are resistant to infection-induced alveolar bone loss, th cells have been implicated in bone-destructive processes during pd. however, the extent to which different th cell subtypes play roles in pathogenesis or host protection remains to be defined and is likely to vary depending on the dominant microorganism involved. by far, porphyromonas gingivalis is the best-studied periodontal microbe in pd. although the gram-negative anaerobe tannerella forsythia is also a vital contributor to periodontal bone loss, almost nothing is known about immune responses to this organism. previous studies from our laboratory revealed that t. forsythia induces periodontal bone loss in mice and that this bone loss depends on the bacterially expressed bspa protein. in this study, we showed that t. forsythia activates murine apcs primarily through tlr2-dependent signaling via bspa. furthermore, t. forsythia infection causes a pronounced th2 bias, evidenced by t cell expression of il-5, but not ifn-gamma or il-17, in draining lymph nodes. consistently, deficiencies in tlr2 or stat6 result in resistance to t. forsythia-induced alveolar bone loss. thus, tlr2 signaling and th2 cells play pathogenic roles in t. forsythia-induced alveolar bone destruction.

AB == membrane-anchored complement regulatory proteins (crps), including cd46, cd55, and cd59, protect host cells from complement attack. in the present study, we investigated whether periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines modulate crp gene/protein expression in human oral epithelial cells. the lipopolysaccharide of treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were the most potent for increasing the gene expression of cd55 and cd59, and to a lesser extent cd46, after a 48-h stimulation. an lipopolysaccharide-induced upregulation of epithelial cell-surface crp was also demonstrated. the stimulation of epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide was associated with interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 secretion. although these two cytokines had no effect on cd46 and cd55 gene expression in epithelial cells, il-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced a significant upregulation. the cell-surface expression of crp was also increased by the stimulation of epithelial cells with cytokines. the cd46, cd55, and cd59 gene/protein expression was upregulated by periodontopathogen lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines. it can be hypothesized that, when faced with bacterial challenges and inflammatory conditions associated with active periodontal sites, oral epithelial cells may respond by increasing crp gene/protein expression to avoid cell lysis by the complement system, which is activated during periodontitis.

TI == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI == periodontal conditions and prevalence of putative periodontopathogens and candida spp. in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis--a pilot study.
AB == objectives: the aims of this study were to evaluate periodontal conditions and identify the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and four different species of candida (c. albicans, c. dubliniensis, c. glabrata and c. tropicalis) in periodontal pockets and furcation sites of insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with generalised chronic periodontitis. design: clinical parameters, including oral status assessed using plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, gingival recession and clinical attachment level and systemic conditions with fasting glucose level or glycosylated haemoglobin were measured in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis. samples of subgingival biofilm were obtained from the periodontal pockets and furcation sites and submitted to phenol-chloroform dna extraction and pcr analysis using specific primers. results: clinical conditions of diabetic and non-diabetic patients were similar, without statistical differences in both periodontal indexes and glucose levels (p>0.05). diabetics had a higher prevalence of candida spp., mainly c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, and a lower frequency of t. forsythia, when compared to non-diabetic patients, for both periodontal sites. c. glabrata and c. tropicalis were not found in periodontal pockets and furcation sites of non-diabetic patients. conclusion: the results demonstrated a strong colonisation of candida spp. in the periodontal sites of diabetic patients that have generalised chronic periodontitis with a higher prevalence of c. dubliniensis followed by c. albicans.

TI == clarithromycin, as an adjunct to non surgical periodontal therapy for chronic periodontitis: a double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB == objective: along with conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy (nspt) systemic antimicrobials may provide more effective treatment for chronic periodontitis by targeting tissue-invasive bacteria. the aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial was to evaluate the adjunctive effects of oral clarithromycin (clm) to non-surgical periodontal therapy for chronic periodontitis. methods: 40 patients were categorized into two groups: test group - scaling and root planing (srp) plus clm (500 mg b.i.d. for 3 days) and control group - srp plus placebo. clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. they included gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). also microbial analysis of dental plaque was done at baseline, 3 and 9 months to estimate the levels of periodontopathic organisms using polymerase chain reaction. anova, chi-square and bonferroni tests were used for statistical analysis. results: thirty-seven subjects completed the study and the results demonstrated that both groups displayed clinical improvements. using a subject-based analysis, patients treated with srp+clm showed enhanced reductions in pd and gains in cal (p<0.001) over time, as compared to control group. also significant reductions in periodontopathic organisms were noticed in the test group compared to control group. however, no statistically significant differences were noted for tannerella forsythia levels between the groups during the course of the study. conclusions: the utilisation of clm in combination with srp improves the efficacy of nspt in reducing pd, improving cal and in lessening microbial loads. hence, clm may be beneficial in the non-surgical treatment regimen of chronic periodontitis.

TI == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI == inhibition of host- and bacteria-derived proteinases by natural anthocyanins.
AB == background and objectives: host- and bacteria-derived proteinases are considered  to play critical roles in periodontitis progression. this study investigated the ability of a blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-o-glucoside, cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside and delphinidin-3-o-rutinoside) to inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), neutrophil elastase and periodontopathogen (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) proteinases. material and methods: enzyme inhibition was detected using fluorometric and colorimetric assays after incubating blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins (at concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mug/ml) with mmps, elastase or bacterial proteinases, along with their specific substrates. substrate degradation was recorded every hour for up to 4 h. results: the blackcurrant extract (50 mug/ml) inhibited all proteinases tested. mmp-1 and mmp-9 were significantly inhibited by pure anthocyanins at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 50 mug/ml. elastase activity was inhibited by cyanidin-3-o-glucoside and cyanidin-3-o-rutinoside in the range of 6.25-50 mug/ml and by delphinidin-3-o-rutinoside at 50 mug/ml. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola proteinases were also significantly inhibited by pure anthocyanins. in all cases, enzyme inhibition was time-dependent. conclusion: our study showed that a blackcurrant extract and its major anthocyanins were able to inhibit the activity of host- and bacteria-derived proteinases. this suggests that such natural compounds may represent promising agents for use in adjunctive treatments for periodontitis.

AB == background: microbial agents in root canal systems can induce periodontal inflammation. the aims of this study are to detect anaerobic microorganisms in endodontic-periodontal lesions, determine the genetic diversity among them, and assess the simultaneous colonization of the pulp and periodontal microenvironments by a single clone. methods: twenty-seven teeth of patients with endodontic-periodontal lesions were selected. samples were spread on an agar-blood medium, the detection of each species was performed using a polymerase chain reaction, and the determination of the simultaneous presence of the same species in the microenvironments by one or more clones was determined using arbitrarily primed pcr. results: prevotella intermedia (pi) was the most prevalent species of the colonies in periodontal pockets, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and pi were the more prevalent in root canals. isolates of pi and pg were simultaneously identified in root canals and periodontal pockets. eighteen percent of teeth exhibited the simultaneous colonization by pg, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and porphyromonas endodontalis in the pulp and periodontal microenvironments. the presence of these species was noted even in niches from which no colonies were isolated. seventeen different genotypes were found in periodontal and pulp sites, with the majority of sites colonized by one or two different genotypes. a high degree of genotype similarity was found for samples of pg isolated from only one site as well as for those isolated from both microenvironments. conclusion: different clones of pi and pg with a high intraspecific genotype similarity were found to colonize the same anatomic sites in endodontic-periodontal infections.

TI == viral-bacterial associations in acute apical abscesses.
AB == objective: viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. this study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. study design: dna extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) approach. single or nested pcr assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (hpv) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. results: two-thirds of the abscess samples were positive for at least one of the target viruses. specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were hhv-8 (54.5%); hpv (9%); and varicella zoster virus (vzv), epstein-barr virus (ebv), and hhv-6 (6%). bacterial dna was present in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were treponema denticola (70%), tannerella forsythia (67%), porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), dialister invisus (61%), and dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). hhv-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and hpv with 4, but all these associations were weak. several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. conclusions: findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral dna occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from endodontic abscesses. although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.

AB == background: we aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (chx) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (srp). methods: twenty-four patients presenting with >/=12 teeth with probing depth (pd) >/=5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. after prophylaxis, chx chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with pd >/=5 mm. ten days later, srp was performed in all teeth with pd >/=4 mm in a single appointment. immediately after srp, new chips were inserted in all pockets with pd >/=5 mm. parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of srp; and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of srp; and at 1 month after treatment. periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed. serum levels of high sensitive c-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were measured. the changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by mann-whitney u test (p <0.05). results: all clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time. there was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (cal) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (p <0.05). the treatment with chx chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the "red complex" after 1 month (p = 0.02). conclusion: the use of chx chips before and immediately after srp improved cal and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

TI == microbial changes after full-mouth tooth extraction, followed by 2-stage implant  placement.
AB == background: recent studies showed that qpcr could detect bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis in a low concentration after full-mouth tooth extraction. this study monitored the microbiota from tooth extraction, over 9 months of full edentulism, up to 1 year after abutment connection. material and methods: ten patients with severe periodontitis were recruited. six months after tooth extraction, implants were inserted. three to 6 months later, they were connected to abutments. plaque samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, saliva, and subgingival area (teeth/implants) before extraction up to 1 year after abutment connection, and analysed via culture, qpcr, and checkerboard technology. results: a reduction in the total amount of aerobic and anaerobic cfu/ml was observed. the concentration of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (qpcr and checkerboard) in the saliva and, to a lower extent, on the tongue dorsum reduced. for prevotella intermedia, changes were negligible and no changes could be detected for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the pristine subgingival niches were quickly colonized by key pathogens. their final concentration remained low, while the detection frequencies remained very high over time. conclusion: complete edentulation results in a significant reduction of bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis, with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans, which might indicate that key pathogens can survive without pockets.

TI == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%; 28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42), eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI == decreased phosphorylation of platelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in periodontitis--a role of periodontal pathogens.
AB == introduction: epidemiological studies indicate an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (vasp) in its phosphorylated form represents a regulator of platelet function and an indicator for the sensitivity of platelets towards physiologically relevant antagonists of platelet function. as platelets and their activation state play a central role in the development of cardiovascular disease, this study aimed to investigate the influence of periodontal disease and periodontal pathogens on intraplatelet vasp-phosphorylation and platelet function. material and methods: besides several markers of platelet activation, basal and pge(1) induced intracellular vasp-phosphorylation were determined in platelets of periodontitis patients (n = 26) and healthy donors (n = 19). furthermore, platelets from healthy donors were incubated with distinct periodontal pathogens and basal and pge(1) induced vasp-phosphorylation was determined. results: compared to controls, platelets of periodontitis patients showed a significant decrease in basal and pge(1) induced vasp-phosphorylation. vasp-phosphorylation in platelets from periodontitis patients positive for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis or tannerella forsythia was significantly decreased compared to patients that were negative for these bacteria. furthermore, vasp-phosphorylation in platelets isolated from healthy donors was affected by incubation with these periodontal pathogens. conclusions: our results provide evidence that periodontitis interferes with vasp-phosphorylation in human platelets, presumably as a consequence of a direct effect of periodontitis-associated bacteria. decreased basal and pge(1) induced vasp-phosphorylation might represent a mechanism responsible for enhanced platelet activation in periodontitis.

AB == aim: the aim of this study was to assess the presence of subgingival pathogens in peripheral blood samples from periodontitis patients before and after scaling and root planing (sc/rp) using nested polymerase chain reaction (nested pcr). materials and methods: peripheral blood samples were obtained from 42 patients with severe generalized chronic or aggressive periodontitis. in each patient, four samples of peripheral blood were drawn at different times: immediately before the sc/rp procedure; immediately after sc/rp; 15 and 30 min. post-sc/rp. blood samples were analysed for bacteraemia with anaerobic culturing and nested pcr, using universal bacterial primers that target the 16s-rrna gene of most bacteria, subsequently re-amplified with specific primers to porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus and prevotella intermedia, using a modified phenol-chloroform method for dna extraction. results: presence of specific periodontal pathogens in peripheral blood after treatment was detected in 54.8% of the patients, in 47.6% with anaerobic culturing and in 19% with nested pcr. in 16.6%, the periodontal pathogens were detected before sc/rp. p. gingivalis and a. actynomicetemcomitans were the pathogens most frequently detected in the bloodstream before and after sc/rp. conclusions: nested pcr demonstrated the presence of dna from periodontal pathogens in blood samples in severe periodontitis patients before, during and after periodontal therapy. the use of these molecular-based techniques may improve the accuracy from the results obtained by haemoculture.

TI == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p. intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%, p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI == polymicrobial infection with periodontal pathogens specifically enhances microrna mir-146a in apoe-/- mice during experimental periodontal disease.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia are periodontal pathogens associated with the etiology of adult periodontitis as polymicrobial infections. recent studies demonstrated that oral infection with p. gingivalis induces both periodontal disease and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic and proatherogenic apoe(-/-) mice. in this study, we explored the expression of micrornas (mirnas) in maxillas (periodontium) and spleens isolated from apoe(-/-) mice infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a polymicrobial infection. mirna expression levels, including mirna mir-146a, and associated mrna expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) were measured in the maxillas and spleens from mice infected with periodontal pathogens and compared to those in the maxillas and spleens from sham-infected controls. furthermore, in response to these periodontal pathogens (as mono- and polymicrobial heat-killed and live bacteria), human thp-1 monocytes demonstrated similar mirna expression patterns, including that of mir-146a, in vitro. strikingly, mir-146a had a negative correlation with tnf-alpha secretion in vitro, reducing levels of the adaptor kinases il-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (irak-1) and tnf receptor-associated factor 6 (traf6). thus, our studies revealed a persistent association of mir-146a expression with these periodontal pathogens, suggesting that mir-146a may directly or indirectly modulate or alter the chronic periodontal pathology induced by these microorganisms.

TI == salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei. corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI == use of quantitative pcr to evaluate methods of bacteria sampling in periodontal patients.
AB == periodontal disease is associated with specific periodontal pathogens and may persist as gingivitis or progress to more severe disease. the bacteria involved in disease initiation and progression have not been identified. we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to compare the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, and total bacteria detected by different sampling methods. on the basis of the results of clinical examinations, 57 patients were divided into 3 groups: healthy group (group a), gingivitis group (group b), and periodontitis group (group c). bacterial samples were collected from saliva, mouthwash, and by paper-point sampling of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and the samples were analyzed with quantitative pcr targeting 16s rrna. the numbers of total bacteria in samples of gcf, saliva, and mouthwash were 10(5) to 10(6), 10(8), and 10(7), respectively, per milliliter. the number of p. gingivalis in gcf samples was lower than 10 in group a; however, in groups b and c, the values were 10(3) and 10(4), respectively, indicating that the number of p. gingivalis increased with worsening clinical status. findings were similar in the samples of saliva and mouthwash. the numbers of t. forsythia showed a pattern similar to that of p. gingivalis in all 3 samples. these results suggest that saliva and mouthwash samples are clinically useful for bacterial testing of periodontal diseases by quantitative pcr. in addition, mouthwash sampling is more feasible and straightforward than saliva sampling.

AB == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550) of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile 15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

AB == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are oral pathogens associated with periodontitis. the association between these three bacteria and periodontal disease has been reported in populations of many countries. however, corresponding data in chinese populations are still lacking. the aim of this study was to detect these pathogens in subgingival plaque collected from 468 subjects with chronic periodontitis in a group of chinese adults by using a pcr method and to determine the degree of association between the target bacteria and periodontal status based on logistic regression analysis. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia were found in 20.5%, 70.7%, and 77.1% of the subjects, respectively. about one-third (36.1%) of subjects had chronic periodontitis. upon univariate analysis, age, male gender, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis were positively associated with chronic periodontitis, whereas education and income exhibited inverse associations with chronic periodontitis. upon multivariate analysis, education, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis remained significant. the adjusted odds ratios for having chronic periodontitis were 2.5 and 3.4 in subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, respectively. however, no significant association was observed between the presence of t. forsythia and periodontal status. this study assesses the prevalence of periodontal pathogens and chronic periodontitis and the associations with sociodemographic characteristics among this group of chinese adults. these findings also suggest that pcr should be considered for field oral epidemiologic studies and may be necessary in investigations presenting major logistic challenges.

AB == objective: this study was designed to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis are synergistic in terms of virulence potential using a model of mixed-microbial infection in rats. materials and methods: three groups of rats were infected orally with either t. forsythia or p. gingivalis in mono-bacterial infections or as mixed-microbial infections for 12 weeks and a sham-infected group were used as a control. this study examined bacterial infection, inflammation, immunity, and alveolar bone loss changes with disease progression. results: tannerella forsythia and p. gingivalis genomic dna was detected in microbial samples from infected rats by pcr indicating their colonization in the rat oral cavity. primary infection induced significantly high igg, igg2b, igg1, and igg2a antibody levels indicating activation of mixed th1 and th2 immune responses. rats infected with the mixed-microbial consortium exhibited significantly increased palatal horizontal and interproximal alveolar bone loss. histological examinations indicated significant hyperplasia of the gingival epithelium with moderate inflammatory infiltration and apical migration of junctional epithelium. the results observed differ compared to uninfected controls. conclusion: our results indicated that t. forsythia and p. gingivalis exhibit virulence, but not virulence synergy, resulting in the immuno-inflammatory responses and lack of humoral immune protection during periodontitis in rats.

TI == a 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB == aim: supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. this study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (gi) on dental implants and peri-implant tissues. materials and methods: one hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. at baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, gi and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. results: subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). there were significantly fewer gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, solobacterium moorei, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and gi.

TI == relationship between oral status and prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongues of elderly individuals.
AB == colonization of periodontopathic bacteria is associated with increased risk of systemic diseases. however, few studies have investigated the relationships between oral status factors and health-related quality of life (hr-qol) and the prevalence of such bacteria in elderly individuals. this study investigated the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia in 165 community-dwelling functionally independent 85-year-old japanese individuals (93 dentate, 72 edentulous) and the relationship to oral status, including oral malodour and hr-qol. all four of the studied periodontopathic bacteria were found more frequently in tongue coating samples from dentate than edentulous subjects, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola was significantly related to the number of teeth with a periodontal pocket depth >/=4 mm. these results suggest the existence of a stable circulation of periodontopathic bacteria between the gingival sulcus and tongue coating over time with teeth. in addition, the presence of teeth with a deep pocket and colonization of treponema denticola were positively related to the level of ch(3)sh, whilst the number of present teeth contributed positively to hr-qol, especially with regard to mental health. in conclusion, as the dentate state can retain colonization of periodontopathic pathogens in the oral cavity, both periodontal treatment and tongue care are important for maintaining a healthy oral status in the elderly, and possibly result in avoidance of risk for tooth loss and decline in hr-qol, as well as protecting from systemic diseases.

TI == [association between phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia and periodontopathic  bacteria in institutionalized patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities].
AB == the association between phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia (pigh) and five major periodontopathic bacteria was investigated by real-time pcr in 12 subjects (30.6 +/- 7.95 years of age) with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. the subjects had not received antibiotics or periodontal therapy within three months. a healthy gingival site or a site with the lowest gingival hyperplasia score (minimum site), and a site with the maximum score of gingival hyperplasia (maximum site) on each subject were selected for investigation. the clinical parameters were measured after microbial sampling. the following results were obtained: 1. the detection rates of both treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis were 75% (9/12) at the maximum sites, and that of tannerella forsythia was 33.3% (4/12). the detection rate of prevotella intermedia was 58.3% (7/12), but no significant correlation was observed between this bacterium and the other types of bacteria in quantitative analysis. 2. the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was 25% (1/4) at the minimum sites, and 83.3% (5/6) at the maximum sites. 3. the samples were divided into three groups; namely, those with no detection of p. gingivalis at either the minimum sites or the maximum sites, no detection at the minimum sites but detection at the maximum sites, and detection at both sites. in conclusion, 1) the detection rates of t. denticola and p. gingivalis were the highest at the maximum sites. in particular, the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was high in the present study, and 2) the subgingival microflora was diverse because of the diverse severity of gingival inflammation associated with pigh.

AB == the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the bana test to detect different levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia or their combinations in subgingival samples at the initial diagnosis and after periodontal therapy. periodontal sites with probing depths between 5-7 mm and clinical attachment level between 5-10 mm, from 53 subjects with chronic periodontitis, were sampled in four periods: initial diagnosis (t0), immediately (t1), 45 (t2) and 60 days (t3) after scaling and root planing. bana test and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization identified red complex species in the subgingival biofilm. in all experimental periods, the highest frequencies of score 2 (checkerboard dna-dna hybridization) for p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia were observed when strong enzymatic activity (bana) was present (p < 0.01). the best agreement was observed at initial diagnosis. the bana test sensitivity was 95.54% (t0), 65.18% (t1), 65.22% (t2) and 50.26% (t3). the specificity values were 12.24% (t0), 57.38% (t1), 46.27% (t2) and 53.48% (t3). the bana test is more effective for the detection of red complex pathogens when the bacterial levels are high, i.e. in the initial diagnosis of chronic periodontitis.

TI == periodontitis: a polymicrobial disruption of host homeostasis.
AB == periodontitis, or gum disease, affects millions of people each year. although it  is associated with a defined microbial composition found on the surface of the tooth and tooth root, the contribution of bacteria to disease progression is poorly understood. commensal bacteria probably induce a protective response that prevents the host from developing disease. however, several bacterial species found in plaque (the 'red-complex' bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) use various mechanisms to interfere with host defence mechanisms. furthermore, disease may result from 'community-based' attack on the host. here, i describe the interaction of the host immune system with the oral bacteria in healthy states and in diseased states.

TI == periodontitis associated with chediak-higashi syndrome in a young african american male.
AB == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (chs) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic  disease. the primary defect is abnormal granule formation in the cells secondary to a mutation of a lysosomal trafficking regulator protein. chs patients have immune system abnormalities, bleeding abnormalities, and multiple infections including periodontitis. methods: a 13-year-old african american male presented with severe gingival inflammation, generalized gingival bleeding, and tooth looseness. comprehensive dental, medical and laboratory evaluations were performed. results: all teeth exhibited excessive mobility. the gingival tissues were swollen and bled easily. most sites had probing depth in excess of 10 mm. dental radiographs showed advanced generalized alveolar bone loss. areas of skin depigmentation were noted. blood smear showed presence of intracellular large granules in white blood cells. platelet function was altered. gingival histopathology showed an intense chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and presence of numerous filamentous bacteria. subgingival microbiological culture showed the presence of porphyromonas gingvalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia. based on the periodontal, medical and laboratory findings a diagnosis of chs was established. because of the advanced periodontal condition and the risk of fatal bacterial infections, exodontias were performed. because of platelet abnormalities the patient developed postoperative bleeding complications that required management with coagulation factor 7. conclusions: advanced periodontitis is an important symptom of chs and may be the first step in the diagnosis of the condition. due to the weakened immunity of chs patients, periodontal management is usually unsuccessful. tooth extractions are recommended to eliminate the periodontal problems and reduce the risk of fatal bacterial infections.

AB == background: despite conflicting results on the use of hormone replacement therapy (hrt) there is no doubt that many women benefit from it. women using hrt are known to be more health conscious in general with putative positive implications in the mouth. however, we observed recently in our cohort hardly any difference in oral health status between hrt-users and non-users. there are only a few studies about hrt and oral microbiota. we hypothesized that counts of periodontal micro-organisms are lower in health-conscious hrt-users than non-users. methods: two-year open follow-up study was conducted on originally 200 hrt-users and 200 non-users from age cohorts of 50-58 years. after clinical examination pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analyses. the results of finally 135 women meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed with cross-tabulation and chi-square test. explanatory factors were studied by step-wise logistic regression analysis. results: in hrt group, the numbers of positive samples for porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis, p < 0.07), prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia, p < 0.05)and tannerella forsythia (t. forsythia, p < 0.01) decreased in women with >or= 4-mm-deep pockets. respectively in hrt users with >or= 6-mm-deep pockets the numbers of positive samples for p. gingivalis (p < 0.05) and t. forsythia (p < 0.01) were decreased. no corresponding differences were observed in the non-hrt group. in logistic regression, the existence of deep periodontal pockets explained the majority of cases harboring specific micro-organisms in both groups. conclusion: although use of hrt did not correlate with periodontal health status, hrt led to decreasing numbers of positive samples of the periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. further studies with longer observation time are needed to observe the clinical relevance of the results.

TI == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

AB == background: crohn's disease (cd) was reported to have oral manifestations. however, data on periodontal parameters and oral microbiology in cd are rare. recent studies showed associations of variants in the caspase recruitment domain (card)15 gene with cd that are involved in the immune response toward bacterial products. our aim is to investigate the periodontal status and prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with cd under consideration of the card15 polymorphism. methods: oral soft tissue alterations and periodontal parameters of 147 patients with cd were assessed. subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa; previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf; previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia (pi), and campylobacter rectus (cr ) using dot-blot hybridization. card15 genotyping was performed with the a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based assay. results: a total of 36.7% of patients had oral manifestations predominated by gingival swellings (27.2%) and hyperplastic lesions of the buccal mucosa (20.4%). the mean probing depth and mean clinical attachment level were 3.6 and 3.8 mm, respectively. a total of 57.8% of the patients had a community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn) score 3, and 31.3% of had a cpitn score 4. the prevalence of aa, pg, pi, tf, and cr was 76.9%, 62.6%, 79.6%, 64.6%, and 94.6%, respectively. pi was significantly less frequent in carriers of card15 mutations compared to the wild type (69.7% versus 87.7%; p = 0.008). all other pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters did not differ significantly as to the card15 polymorphism. conclusions: our findings suggest that patients with cd have an increased prevalence and moderate severity of periodontitis. the colonization of periodontal pathogens, in particular cr, might be of particular value for the periodontal manifestation of cd. although a modulating impact on periodontal microbiota can be supposed, our data do not support the role of card15 in oral symptoms and periodontal lesions in patients with cd.

TI == profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time pcr.
AB == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

TI == dna from porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia induce cytokine production in human monocytic cell lines.
AB == toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) expression is increased in periodontally diseased tissues compared with healthy sites indicating a possible role of tlr9 and its ligand, bacterial dna (bdna), in periodontal disease pathology. here, we determine the immunostimulatory effects of periodontal bdna in human monocytic cells (thp-1). thp-1 cells were stimulated with dna of two putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. the role of tlr9 in periodontal bdna-initiated cytokine production was determined either by blocking tlr9 signaling in thp-1 cells with chloroquine or by measuring il-8 production and nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) activation in hek293 cells stably transfected with human tlr9. cytokine production (il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha) was increased significantly in bdna-stimulated cells compared with controls. chloroquine treatment of thp-1 cells decreased cytokine production, suggesting that tlr9-mediated signaling pathways are operant in the recognition of dna from periodontal pathogens. compared with native hek293 cells, tlr9-transfected cells demonstrated significantly increased il-8 production (p < 0.001) and nf-kappab activation in response to bdna, further confirming the role of tlr9 in periodontal bdna recognition. the results of pcr arrays demonstrated upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and nf-kappab genes in response to periodontal bdna in thp-1 cells, suggesting that cytokine induction is through nf-kappab activation. hence, immune responses triggered by periodontal bacterial nucleic acids may contribute to periodontal disease pathology by inducing proinflammatory cytokine production through the tlr9 signaling pathway.

TI == synergistic effects of lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in an ex vivo whole blood model.
AB == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly associated with chronic periodontitis. this disease is characterized by an accumulation of inflammatory cells in periodontal tissue and subgingival sites. the secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines by those cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of whole blood from periodontitis patients following challenges with whole cells of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia or their lipopolysaccharides (lps), individually and in combination. whole blood collected from seven periodontitis patients was stimulated with whole cells or lps and the production of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the mono and mixed challenges with whole bacterial cells or lps induced the secretion of high amounts of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha by the mixed leukocyte population from periodontitis patients. in addition, p. gingivalis lps, t. denticola lps, and t. forsythia lps acted in synergy to induce high levels of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. this study suggests that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may contribute to the immunodestructive host response characteristic of periodontitis through synergistic effects of their lps on the inflammatory response induced by a mixed population of leukocytes.

TI == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

AB == the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are strongly associated with periodontal disease and are highly prevalent in humans with periodontitis. porphyromonas and tannerella spp. have also been isolated from the oral cavity of cats. the oral microflora in animals was compared with those in humans in earlier studies, but no studies are available on the comparison of the oral microflora from pets and their respective owners. the aim of this study was to determine the presence of these bacteria in the oral microflora of cats and their owners, since animal to human transmission, or vice versa, of oral pathogens could have public health implications. this study investigated the prevalence of porphyromonas gulae, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia in the oral microflora of cats and their owners, using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). all porphyromonas isolates from cats (n=64) were catalase positive, whereas the porphyromonas isolates from owners (n=7) were catalase negative, suggesting that the isolates from cats were p. gulae whereas those from the owners were p. gingivalis. t. forsythia was recovered from both cats (n=63) and owners (n=31); the proportion of t. forsythia relative to the total cfu was higher in cats with periodontitis than in cats without periodontal disease. genotyping of t. forsythia isolates (n=54) in six cat/owner couples showed that in one cat/owner couple the t. forsythia isolates (n=6) were identical. these t. forsythia isolates were all catalase positive, which led us to hypothesize that transmission from cats to owners had occurred and that cats may be a reservoir of t. forsythia.

TI == comparison of two different microbiological test kits for detection of periodontal pathogens.
AB == objective: the aim of this study was to compare the outcome of two different microbiological tests for detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.) and treponema denticola (t.d.). material and methods: a total of 69 adult patients with severe chronic (scp) or aggressive periodontitis (agp) participated in the study. microbiological samples were examined for a.a., p.g., t.f. and t.d. using an rna probe test (pado) and a real-time polymerase chain reaction test (meri). results: for all periodontal pathogens under investigation, the median bacterial counts detected with pado were smaller compared to those detected with meri. p.g., t.f. and t.d. could be found in the majority of all patients with both tests. with meri, a.a. was detected more often (24.6%) than with pado (18.8%). only 10.1% of the patients tested positive for a.a. with both tests. conclusion: both tests showed a high percentage of agreement for p.g., t.f. and t.d., but exhibited marked differences in the detection of a.a.

TI == periodontal bacterial load: a proposed new epidemiological method for periodontal disease assessment.
AB == aim: the purpose of this study was to identify a periodontal clinical measure that correlates with red complex bacteria usually associated with periodontal disease. methods and materials: periodontal clinical parameters were recorded in 116 postpartum women at six sites per tooth for all teeth excluding third molars. two subgingival plaque samples per subject were collected and analyzed for 39 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. periodontal bacterial load (pbl) was calculated as the sum of all pocket depth measurements of 4 mm at sites with a clinical attachment level (cal) of 4 mm. the association of clinical and bacterial scores was analyzed using the spearman correlation coefficient and the kruskal-wallis test. results: the pbl was correlated with microorganisms from the red complex that included porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, individually or grouped (p<0.05). the pbl was not associated with periodontally beneficial species from the yellow, green, purple, and blue complexes (p>0.05). the proportions and mean counts of the red complex were increased according to the quartile groups of distribution of the pbl. conclusion: pbl appears to be a reliable measure of periodontal status in postpartum women. clinical significance: pbl avoids bias in the assessment of periodontal status in studies of periodontal disease.

TI == subgingival plaque removal using a new air-polishing device.
AB == background: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, patient acceptance, and short-term microbiologic effect of a new air-polishing device in subjects in maintenance care with residual pockets > or =5 mm. methods: this was an examiner-masked, randomized, split-mouth clinical trial. a new disposable nozzle, allowing the subgingival application of amino acid glycine powder at a limited pressure, was compared to scaling and root planing (srp) in 50 subjects with residual pockets during the maintenance phase. after removing supragingival deposits, the spray was applied for 4 to 5 seconds in all sites > or =5 mm in the test quadrant, whereas srp was used in the control quadrant. microbiologic samples were taken from one treated test and one control site 2 days before and 7 days after treatment. total bacterial counts and the counts of six periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no adverse event was noted in any subject for the test or control treatment. using a visual analog scale, the patients perceived the test treatment to be significantly less painful/uncomfortable than the hand instrumentation (p <0.001). significantly less time was used by the operator for the test procedure (p <0.001). the reduction in bleeding on probing was significant for the treated sites in the test and control quadrants (p = 0.019 and p <0.001, respectively), but traditional srp reduced the bleeding tendency significantly more than air polishing (p = 0.045). the differences in the total bacterial load and the counts of six periodontal pathogens between the test and control sites did not reach statistical significance. the longitudinal reduction was significant in control sites for total bacteria load (p <0.001), porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.01), treponema denticola (p <0.001), and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p <0.001). conclusion: subgingival air polishing with a new device was safe (no adverse events were noted), perceived to be more acceptable by the patients, and was more time-efficient than srp; however, on a microbiologic level, it was not superior to conventional srp.

TI == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours; then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI == evaluating clinical periodontal measures as surrogates for bacterial exposure: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest).
AB == background: epidemiologic studies of periodontal infection as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease often use clinical periodontal measures as a surrogate for the underlying bacterial exposure of interest. there are currently no methodological studies evaluating which clinical periodontal measures best reflect the levels of subgingival bacterial colonization in population-based settings. we investigated the characteristics of clinical periodontal definitions that were most representative of exposure to bacterial species that are believed to be either markers, or themselves etiologic, of periodontal disease. methods: 706 men and women aged >or= 55 years, residing in northern manhattan were enrolled. using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization in subgingival biofilms, standardized values for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were averaged within mouth and summed to define "bacterial burden". correlations of bacterial burden with clinical periodontal constructs defined by the severity and extent of attachment loss (al), pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed. results: clinical periodontal constructs demonstrating the highest correlations with bacterial burden were: i) percent of sites with bop (r = 0.62); ii) percent of sites with pd >or= 3 mm (r = 0.61); and iii) number of sites with bop (r = 0.59). increasing pd or al severity thresholds consistently attenuated correlations, i.e., the correlation of bacterial burden with the percent of sites with pd >or= 8 mm was only r = 0.16. conclusions: clinical exposure definitions of periodontal disease should incorporate relatively shallow pockets to best reflect whole mouth exposure to bacterial burden.

TI == differential effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors slpi, elafin,  scca1, and scca2.
AB == objective: secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (slpi), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2 (scca1 and scca2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. to determine the effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants of various periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. design: the gene expression and secretion of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were determined using real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. the direct effects of periopathogens and p. gingivalis gingipain mutants on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by western blot. the effect on the innate immune response of gecs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hbd2) and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 (ccl20). results: we found that slpi, scca2, elafin, hbd2, and ccl20 gene expression levels were significantly induced (p<0.001) in response to p. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in response to stimulation by other bacteria. p. gingivalis reduced the secretion of slpi and elafin significantly in gecs, and degraded recombinant slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2. differential degradation patterns of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were observed with different bacteria as well as p. gingivalis mutants associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by p. gingivalis. in addition, pretreatment of gecs with slpi, scca1, or scca2 partially blocked hbd2 and ccl20 mrna expression in response to p. gingivalis, suggesting a protective effect. conclusion: our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the host protease inhibitors in a different manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. the balance between cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal infection.

TI == association of human t lymphotropic virus 1 amplification of periodontitis severity with altered cytokine expression in response to a standard periodontopathogen infection.
AB == background: periodontal diseases (pds) are infectious diseases in which periodontopathogens trigger chronic inflammatory and immune responses that lead to tissue destruction. recently, viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pds. individuals infected with human t lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-1) present with abnormal oral health and a marked increased prevalence of periodontal disease. methods: in this study, we investigated the patterns of periodontopathogen infection and local inflammatory immune markers in htlv-1-seropositive individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp/htlv-1 group) compared with htlv-1-seronegative individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp group) and periodontally healthy, htlv-1-seronegative individuals (control group). results: patients in the cp/htlv-1 group had significantly higher values of bleeding on probing, mean probing depth, and attachment loss than patients in the cp group. the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (il) 4 was found to be similar in the cp and cp/htlv-1 groups, whereas il-12 and il-17 levels trended toward a higher expression in the cp/htlv-1 group. a significant increase was seen in the levels of il-1beta and interferon gamma in the cp/htlv-1 group compared with the cp group, whereas expression of the regulatory t cell marker foxp3 and il-10 was significantly decreased in the lesions from the cp/htlv-1 group. interestingly, similar frequency and/or load of periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) and frequency of viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus, and epstein-barr virus) characteristically associated with pds were found in the cp/htlv and cp groups. conclusions: htlv-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease through the deregulation of the local cytokine network, resulting in an exacerbated response against a standard periodontopathogen infection.

TI == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI == changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs.
AB == the incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug chlo-site or metronidazole. even within two weeks, a turnover of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. a relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. this should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

TI == do periodontopathogens disappear after full-mouth tooth extraction?
AB == aim: to monitor the intra-oral microbiological changes after full-mouth extraction using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). material and methods: nine patients with severe, aggressive periodontitis, for whom a full-mouth tooth extraction was the only remaining treatment option were recruited. before and 6 months after extraction, microbial samples were obtained (tongue, saliva and subgingival plaque) and analysed by qpcr. results: the elimination of subgingival niches, by extraction of all natural teeth, resulted in a 3-log reduction of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and more modest reductions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia. however, the detection frequencies of these periodontopathogens in saliva and on the tongue remained unchanged after full-mouth tooth extraction. conclusion: in contrast to what has been believed so far, full-mouth tooth extraction does not result in eradication of all periodontopathogens but only in a significant reduction. the clinical consequences of this observation remain speculative.

TI == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a 12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t. denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

AB == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of clinical periodontal parameters and the presence of periodontal pathogens in patients with acute myocardial infarction (ami). methods: a total of 104 subjects (54 patients with ami and 50 healthy controls) were included. subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa; previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf; previously t. forsythensis), and prevotella intermedia (pi) using dot-blot hybridization. results: patients with ami had a significantly higher frequency of probing depths (pds) >or=4 mm than controls (39.2% versus 14.9%; p <0.0001). among different cutoff levels, the frequency of >50% sites with pds >or=4 mm showed the highest discrepancy between both groups (33% versus 0%; p <0.001). all periodontal pathogens were overrepresented in patients with ami and positively correlated with increased periodontal pd and clinical attachment level (cal). after adjustment for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, plaque index, statin intake, and ratio of cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein, pg remained a significant predictor for ami (odds ratio [or]: 13.6; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 3.1 to 59.8; p = 0.0005). furthermore, the simultaneous presence of aa + pg (p = 0.0005) and aa + pg + tf (p = 0.0018) were found with significantly higher frequency in patients with ami than controls. conclusions: the results of our study confirm an association between periodontitis and ami in which periodontal destruction was correlated with the presence of periodontal pathogens. in particular, pg might be considered a potential risk indicator for ami.

TI == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

AB == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes, granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI == t-rflp-based mcra gene analysis of methanogenic archaea in association with oral  infections and evidence of a novel methanobrevibacter phylotype.
AB == introduction: increasing evidence suggests a role for methanogenic archaea (methanogens) in human health and disease via syntrophic interactions with bacteria. here we assessed the prevalence and distribution of methanogens and possible associations with bacteria in oral biofilms. methods: forty-four periodontal and 32 endodontic samples from necrotic teeth with radiographic evidence of apical periodontitis were analysed. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis based on the mcra gene, specific to methanogens, was applied. the prevalence and amounts of methanogens in endodontic samples were compared with those of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema spp. and synergistes spp. based on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions. results: besides dominance of the mcra gene corresponding to methanobrevibacter oralis, one mcra gene type, for which no cultivated member has been reported previously, was identified in five periodontal samples and one endodontic sample. rates of non-synonymous vs. synonymous nucleotide substitutions suggest that this mcra gene type codes for a functionally active methyl-coenzyme m reductase. methanobrevibacter smithii, the prominent methanogen in the human gut system, was not detected. mean proportions of methanogens were comparable to synergistes spp. ranging from 0.5 to 1.0% of the total microbial community. treponema spp. dominated with a mean proportion of 10%, while the mean proportions of the other endodontic pathogens were below 0.1%. a positive association between methanogens and synergistes spp. was found. conclusion: our data provide evidence of a novel, as yet uncultured methanogenic phylotype in association with oral infections, and indicate possible interactions between methanogens and synergistes spp., the nature of which deserves further investigation.

TI == quantification of periodontal pathogens by paper point sampling from the coronal  and apical aspect of periodontal lesions by real-time pcr.
AB == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p = 0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of the periodontal lesion.

TI == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

AB == objectives: this study is intended to verify the correlation among clinical indices of the peri-implant soft tissues, the histological condition and the presence of 3 pathogens commonly associated with peri-implant diseases (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia). materials: four clinical indices, gingival index (gi), sulcus bleeding index, gi modified by mombelli, and plaque index modified by mombelli (mpi) were evaluated around 1 dental implant of each subject (n = 10). subgingival plaque was collected for bacterial analysis (polymerase chain reaction) and a biopsy of peri-implant soft tissues for histological analysis was harvested. the clinical indices and detected pathogens correlated with a developed histological index (hi). results: there was no statistically significant relationship between the clinical indices (gi, sulcus bleeding index, and gi modified by mombelli) and the hi, except for the mpi on the central area of lingual aspects (r = 0.85, p = 0.0029). there was a tendency for a positive correlation between the mpi on the central area of buccal aspects and the hi (r = 0.63, p = 0.0544). the counting of lymphocytes and plasmocytes correlated positively with hi, thus suggesting the index reliability. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia did not present a significant relationship with the hi. conclusion: despite the small number of samples and the poor statistical significance, the mpi seems to be useful for evaluation of inflammatory severity on soft tissue around dental implants as demonstrated by its relationship with the hi. further studies are necessary to elucidate this subject.

AB == aims: our objective was to evaluate the association between the mmp1-1607 single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp), periodontopathogens and inflammatory cytokines with matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) mrna levels in vitro and in vivo. materials and methods: this study investigated the influence of genetic (mmp1-1607 snp), microbial (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and inflammatory [tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta)] factors on the determination of mmp-1 mrna levels in periodontal tissues of non-smoker chronic periodontitis (cp, n=178) and control (c, n=190) groups. the effects of single and repeated lipopolysaccharide (lps) and inflammatory cytokine stimulation of macrophages with distinct mmp1-1607 snp genotypes were also investigated. results: in healthy tissues, the mmp1-1607 2g allele was associated with higher mmp-1 levels while in cp mmp-1 levels were associated with the presence and load of periodontopathogens, and also with tnf-alpha and il-1beta expression irrespective of the mmp1-1607 genotype. in vitro data demonstrate that in 2g macrophages low- and intermediate-dose lps and tnf-alpha+il-1beta stimulation was associated with increased mmp-1 expression, while strong and repeated stimulation resulted in higher mmp-1 levels irrespective of the mmp1-1607 genotype. conclusion: our data demonstrate a limited role for mmp1-1607 snp in periodontitis, where the extensive chronic antigenic challenge exposure overcomes the genetic control and plays a major role in the determination of mmp-1 expression.

TI == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation. specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

AB == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

AB == aim: this study was designed to evaluate whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the bacterial population in supra/subgingival plaque. material and methods: sixty-six healthy volunteers without severe periodontitis were randomized into two groups to receive lactobacilli or placebo for 8 weeks (8w): the test group (n=34) received 2.01 x 10(9) cfu/day of lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablets; the control group (n=32) received placebo with xylitol. supra/subgingival plaque samples were collected at the baseline and after 4 weeks (4w) and 8w. the bacterial amounts in plaque samples were analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria in the test group was decreased significantly in subgingival plaque at 4w [odds ratio (or)=3.13, 95% confidence intervals (ci)=1.28-7.65, p=0.012]. multivariate analysis showed that significantly higher odds were obtained for the reduction of tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque of the test group at both 4w (or=6.69, 95% ci=2.51-17.9, p<0.001) and 8w (or=3.67, 95% ci=1.45-9.26, p=0.006). conclusion: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli reduced the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria and could contribute to the beneficial effects on periodontal conditions.

TI == the use of perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for delivery of pre-term and low birth-weight infants.
AB == increased levels of oestrogen and progesterone during pregnancy may lead to periodontal disease. the anaerobic gram-negative bacteria classified as the "red complex" (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) are frequently associated with periodontal disease. periodontopathogens produce toxins and enzymes that can enter the bloodstream and cross the placenta to harm the foetus. the response of the mother's immune system to infection by these periodontopathogens brings about the release of inflammatory mediators which may trigger preterm labour or result in low birth-weight infants. the purpose of this study was to examine the use of perioscan as a potential screening test for mothers at risk for pre-term delivery of low birth weight infants due to periodontal disease. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from pregnant women between the ages of 17 to 45 years attending an ante-natal clinic in the western cape in south africa. plaque samples were analyzed by the enzymatic perioscan test for detection of the red complex in 372 sites from 66 women. results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection of the three species of the red complex. seventeen (25.75%) of the population group tested positive with perioscan but only 27 (7.25%) of the 372 sites were positive. of the 66 mothers examined, we managed to retrieve 29 records post-delivery. in all the mothers examined, perioscan results showed an association with the indices used to diagnose periodontal disease, and could also be associated with preterm delivery of low birth-weight infants in two of the 29 maternal records recovered.

TI == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red complex species.

TI == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI == red bacterial complex is associated with the severity of chronic periodontitis in a thai population.
AB == background: the distribution of periodontal pathogens differs in various geographic locations and racial/ethnic groups. this study investigated the microbiological features of chronic periodontitis (cp) patients in thailand. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 20 non-periodontitis subjects, 20 patients with mild cp, and 20 patients with moderate to severe cp were examined using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. results: in the moderate to severe cp patients, there was high prevalence of p. gingivalis (95%), t. forsythia (95%), t. denticola (80%), as well as the red complex (coexistence of all three species at the same lesion) (75%). a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 35% of the patients in this study group. p. gingivalis was detected in as high as 45% of the non-periodontitis controls. cp and disease severity were significantly related to the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola and the red complex. the red complex was not found in any non-periodontitis site. conclusion: red complex bacteria were predominant periodontal pathogens of the moderate to severe form of cp in this thai population. the presence of t. forsythia together with t. denticola, and the red complex species at the same site were significantly associated with the disease severity.

TI == prediction of a caspase-like fold in tannerella forsythia virulence factor prth.
AB == tannerella forsythia is a bacterial pathogen involved in periodontal disease. a cysteine protease prth has been characterized in this bacterium as a virulence factor. prth has the activity of detaching adherent cells from substratum, and the level of prth is associated with periodontal attachment loss. no reports exist on the structure, active site, and catalytic mechanism of prth. using comparative sequence and structural analyses, we have identified homologs of prth in a number of bacterial and archaeal species. prth was found to be remotely related to caspases and other proteases with a caspase-like fold, such as gingipains from another periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. our results offer structural and mechanistic insights into prth and its homologs, and help classification of this protease family.

AB == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

AB == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI == tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB == background and objective: inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high between-subject variation in the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mrna has been verified, which may be a result of genetic polymorphisms and/or the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (called the red complex) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the effect of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfa) -308g/a gene polymorphism and of periodontopathogens on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking patients with chronic periodontitis (n = 127) and in control subjects (n = 177). material and methods: the tnfa -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and the periodontopathogen load were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of the tnfa -308 single nucleotide polymorphism in control and chronic periodontitis groups, in spite of the higher frequency of the a allele in the chronic periodontitis group. the concomitant analyses of genotypes and periodontopathogens demonstrated that tnfa -308 ga/aa genotypes and the red-complex periodontopathogens were independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in periodontal tissues, and no additive effect was seen when both factors were present. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola counts were positively correlated with the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. tnfa -308 genotypes were not associated with the periodontopathogen detection odds or with the bacterial load. conclusion: our results demonstrate that the tnfa -308 a allele and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis patients and consequently are potentially involved in determining the disease outcome.

TI == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

AB == nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (nbps) are anti-bone-resorptive drugs with inflammatory side effects that include osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis of the jaw. oral bacteria have been considered to be a trigger for these nbp-associated jaw bone diseases. the present study examined the effects of alendronate (a typical nbp) and clodronate (a non-nbp) on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages infected with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, which are important pathogens of periodontal diseases. pretreatment with alendronate augmented il-1beta, but not tnfalpha, production by macrophages infected with p. gingivalis or t. forsythia. this augmentation of il-1beta production was inhibited by clodronate. furthermore, caspase-1, a promoter of il-1beta production, was activated by treatment with alendronate, and caspase-1 inhibitor reduced the production of il-1beta induced by alendronate and p. gingivalis. these results suggest that nbps augment periodontal pathogenic bacteria-induced il-1beta release via caspase-1 activation, and this phenomenon may contribute to the development of nbp-associated inflammatory side effects including jaw osteomyelitis. co-treatment with clodronate may prevent and/or reduce these inflammatory effects induced by nbps.

AB == background: herpesviruses may be related to the etiology of aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp) by triggering periodontal destruction or by increasing the risk for bacterial infection. this case-control study evaluated the presence of herpes simplex virus type i (hsv-1), epstein-barr virus type i (ebv-1), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) in patients with generalized agp (agp group), cp (cp group), or gingivitis (g group) and in healthy individuals (c group). methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected with paper points from 30 patients in each group. the nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect hsv-1, ebv-1, and hcmv. bacteria were identified by 16s rrna-based pcr. results: hsv-1, hcmv, and ebv-1 were detected in 86.7%, 46.7%, and 33.3% of the agp group, respectively; in 40.0%, 50.0%, and 46.7% of the cp group, respectively; in 53.3%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of the g group, respectively; and in 20.0%, 56.7%, and 0.0% of the c group, respectively. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected significantly more often in the agp group compared to the other groups (p <0.005). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were identified more frequently in agp and cp groups, and agp, cp, and g groups had higher frequencies of p. intermedia compared to the c group. conclusion: in brazilian patients, hsv-1 and ebv-1, rather than hcmv, were more frequently associated with cp and agp.

TI == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

TI == similarities in the subgingival microbiota assessed by a curet sampling method at sites with chronic periodontitis.
AB == background: the goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. methods: subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (pd) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966 subgingival sites). subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method identifying 37 species. results: probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and 16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. statistical analysis failed to demonstrate differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (p = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (p = 0.78). with the exceptions of campylobacter gracilis (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. a trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for prevotella nigrescens (p <0.01). at a cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. conclusions: given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. this may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.

TI == [relationship of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria and drug-induced gingival overgrowth].
AB == objective: to investigate the effect of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria on the development of drug-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant recipients. methods: a total of 57 patients undergoing cyclosporine treatment were divided into two groups according to go index: with gingival overgrowth (group a) and without gingival overgrowth (group b). demographic, pharmacologic and periodontal data were analyzed. the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect and quantify five putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td) and tannerella forsythia (tf) in subgingival samples. moreover, the relationship between the bacterial amount and the severity of go was analyzed. results: group a presented a significantly higher plaque index, sulcus bleeding index and probing depth than group b (p < 0.01). the occurrences of pg, td, and tf in the group a (96%, 82% and 89%) were significantly increased compared with those in the group b (69%, 55% and 66%, p < 0. 05), respectively. the prevalence of pg, td, and tf in the group a (79%) was markedly higher than that in the group b (38%, p < 0.01). the bacterial amount of pg, td, tf and pi were enhanced along with the severity of go. however, the bacterial amount of aa had no difference between two groups. conclusions: pg, td, and tf may have a significant relationship with the development of go.

AB == aim: the aim of the experiment was to investigate the levels of free soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb ligand (srankl) in periodontal health and disease and their correlations to clinical parameters and important periodontal pathogens. material and methods: chronic periodontitis (n=35) and periodontally healthy (n=38) subjects participated in the present study. pocket depth, recession and bleeding index were recorded at a total of 221 sites. subgingival plaque samples from these sites were analysed for the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. gingival crevicular fluid samples were analysed with elisa for levels of free srankl. comparisons between groups were performed by applying non-parametric tests (mann-whitney) and correlations among parameters were sought for with spearman's r coefficient. results: mean levels of free srankl were higher in periodontitis subjects and correlated significantly with mean counts of t. denticola on the subject level and p. gingivalis, t. denticola on the site level (spearman's r coefficient, p<0.05), but not with clinical parameters. no correlations were found between the levels of free srankl and investigated parameters in periodontally healthy individuals. no effect of smoking was found on investigated parameters and correlations (univariate analysis of variance and pairwise comparisons). conclusions: findings from the present study suggest a correlation of levels of srankl with important pathogens in periodontitis patients.

TI == periodontal and microbiologic evaluation of 2 methods of archwire ligation: ligature wires and elastomeric rings.
AB == introduction: prophylactic programs to prevent dental biofilm accumulation must be implemented to minimize the risk for periodontal diseases in orthodontic patients. therefore, we assessed the possible periodontal and microbiologic changes resulting from the use of 2 methods of orthodontic archwire ligation: elastomeric rings and steel ligatures. methods: the following parameters were measured: plaque index, gingival bleeding index, probing depth, and biofilm samples from the maxillary second premolars and the mandibular lateral incisors were evaluated in 14 subjects without clinical signs of gingival inflammation before orthodontic appliance placement and after 6 months of treatment. each orthodontic arch was fixed with elastomeric rings on 1 side of the midline, and steel ligatures were used on the opposite side. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and p nigrescens. results: the elastomeric rings were associated with a higher score for plaque index and bleeding than steel ligatures, as well as many positive sites of t forsythia and p nigrescens (p <0.05). conclusions: elastomeric rings favored these 2 periodontopathogens and harmed gingival conditions.

TI == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study.
AB == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd, fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB == this study used a nested multiplex pcr method to detect three periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque collected before treatment and at 2 and 6 months posttreatment from 107 patients with severe, generalized periodontitis. the proportions of the patients who harbored these bacteria before periodontal treatment were as follows: tannerella forsythia, 81%; porphyromonas gingivalis, 78%; and aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, 47%. at 2 months posttreatment there was a significant reduction in the numbers of patients harboring p. gingivalis (46%; p < 0.001) or t. forsythia (63%; p = 0.043) but not a. actinomycetemcomitans (50%) compared to pretreatment data. at 6 months posttreatment, significantly fewer patients harbored p. gingivalis (43%; p < 0.001); a. actinomycetemcomitans, (31%; p = 0.025), or t. forsythia (63%; p = 0.030). interestingly, at baseline and at 2 months posttherapy, subjects who harbored only a single pathogen had a greater level of periodontal disease than subjects who harbored two, or all three, of these periodontal pathogens. these data suggest that a reduction in the number of species present may be associated with an increase in the severity of periodontal diseases.

AB == implants showing signs of peri-implantitis harbor a microbiota similar to that of periodontitis-affected teeth. this case report describes the subgingival microbiota of a 45-year-old female with advanced periodontitis before and after complete edentulation and reconstruction with dental implants. a 3-month healing period post extraction passed before implants were placed using a two-stage submerged implant protocol. at 4- to 6-month recall visits after definitive prosthetic reconstruction, some implant sites showed bleeding on probing and localized mucositis. microbiological culture of three inflamed peri-implant sites showed an almost identical spectrum of pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and other major pathogenic bacteria characteristic of aggressive periodontitis. as natural teeth were absent for 8 months, this case report suggests that periodontal pathogens can be retained for a prolonged period of time in nondental sites, from where they can later colonize and compromise the health of dental implants. the therapeutic implications of this finding are discussed.

TI == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria. collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

AB == inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high individual variation in the levels of il-1beta mrna has been verified, which is possibly determined by genetic polymorphisms and/or by the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the role of an il-1beta promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 [il-1beta(3954) snp] and the presence of the periodontopathogens in the determination of the il-1beta levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis (cp) patients (n = 117) and control (c) subjects (n = 175) and the possible correlations with the clinical parameters of the disease. il-1beta(3954) snp was investigated by restriction fragment length polymorphism, while the il-1beta levels and the presence of the periodontopathogens were determined by real-time pcr. similar frequencies of il-1beta(3954) snp were found in the c and cp groups, in spite of a trend toward a higher incidence of t alleles in the cp group. the il-1beta(3954) snp ct and tt genotypes, as well as p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, were associated with higher il-1beta levels and with higher values of the clinical parameters of disease severity. concomitant analyses demonstrate that il-1beta(3954) and the red complex periodontopathogens were found to independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in periodontal tissues. similarly, the concurrent presence of both factors was associated with increased scores of disease severity. il-1beta(3954) genotypes and red complex periodontopathogens, individually and additively, modulate the levels of il-1beta in the diseased tissues of nonsmoking cp patients and, consequently, are potentially involved in the determination of the disease outcome.

TI == effects of age and oral disease on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB == this report evaluated systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in a cohort of  macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) maintained as a large family social unit, including an age range from <1 year to >24 years. we hypothesized that the systemic host responses would be affected by the age, gender, and clinical oral presentation of the population, each contributing to inflammatory and immune responses that would reflect chronic oral infections. the results demonstrated that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, including missing teeth, increased significantly with age. generally, minimal differences in clinical parameters were noted between the genders. systemic inflammatory mediators, including acute-phase reactants, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), cytokines/chemokines, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (mmp), demonstrated significant differences among the various age groups of animals. levels of many of these were increased with age, although pge(2), rantes, bactericidal permeability-inducing factor (bpi), mmp-1, and mmp-9 levels were significantly increased in the young group ( approximately 1 to 3 years old) relative to those for the older animals. we observed that in the adult and aged animals, levels of the systemic inflammatory mediators related to gingival inflammation and periodontal tissue destruction were significantly elevated. serum antibody levels in response to a battery of periodontal pathogens were generally lower in the young animals, <50% of those in the adults, and were significantly related to aging in the cohort. the levels of antibodies, particularly those to porphorymonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and tannerella forsythia, were most significantly elevated in animals with periodontal disease, irrespective of the age of the animal. these results provide a broad description of oral health and host responses in a large cohort of nonhuman primates from very young animals to the aged of this species. the findings afford a base of data with which to examine the ontogeny of host responses at mucosal sites, such as the gingival tissues.

TI == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

AB == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

AB == background: evidence is accumulating that oral bacteria are associated with myocardial infarctions (mi). we were interested in studying the differences in the association between single bacteria or bacteria in combination and the relation to c-reactive protein (crp). material and methods: we examined the levels of antibodies against four major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) and crp in 548 men with a self-reported history of mi to 625 controls who took part in the oslo ii study in 2000. results: the mean levels of bacterial antibodies were higher for the cases than the controls, but not significant as standard deviations were large. the level of crp was higher in the cases than the controls (p=0.010). logistic regression analyses comparing the upper quartile value with the lower value of one of either four antibodies (anti-aa, anti-tf, anti-td and anti-pg) were significantly associated (p=0.032) with mi. equivalent analyses of either three bacteria showed significant associations for anti-aa, anti-td and anti-pg (p=0.036) and anti-aa, anti-pg and anti-tf (p=0.040). crp showed an increased relative risk with increasing quartile value; trend, p=0.016, but not in multivariate analysis including the oral antigens. conclusions: no single bacterium but rather combinations were related to increasing relative risk for mi independent of known cardiovascular risk factors.

TI == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI == interleukin-6 polymorphisms are associated with pathogenic bacteria in subjects with periodontitis.
AB == background: growing evidence suggests that individual genetic susceptibility may  influence the host's response to infections. previously, we showed that a common variation in the interleukin (il)-6 gene was associated with increased odds of detection of common periodontal pathogens from individuals with aggressive periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between il-6 polymorphisms and periodontopathogenic bacteria in a larger, ethnically mixed population of subjects with periodontitis. methods: genomic dna was extracted from 107 subjects diagnosed with severe forms of periodontitis to study a cluster of polymorphisms in inflammatory genes, including il-6. the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) in their subgingival biofilm was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis. serum il-6 and c-reactive protein (crp) concentrations were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the il-6 -6106 polymorphism was associated with the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.009; odds ratio [or] = 3.5; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.38 to 9.16) and the concomitant detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis (p = 0.015; or = 3.6; 95% ci: 1.28 to 10.04). the il-6 -174 polymorphism was associated with increased odds of the concomitant detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis (p = 0.042; or = 2.8; 95% ci: 1.04 to 7.75). haplotype analysis of all five il-6 polymorphisms confirmed an association with the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.046). the il-6 -6106 polymorphism was also associated with crp serum levels at multivariate analysis (p = 0.024). conclusions: these findings confirm the hypothesis that complex interactions between the microbiota and host genome are at the basis of susceptibility to periodontitis. periodontal disease may represent a useful model to study the pathways and mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in inflammatory diseases.

TI == site-specific development of periodontal disease is associated with increased levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque.
AB == background: porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), which are regarded as the principal periodontopathogenic bacteria, exist as a consortium in subgingival biofilms. we aimed to examine quantitative relationships between p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia in subgingival biofilms and the relationship between the quantity and prevalence of these three bacteria and site-specific periodontal health. methods: this study was cross-sectional. the study population consisted of 35 adult subjects who visited the kyushu dental college hospital. plaque samples were collected from 105 periodontal pocket sites. quantitative analyses of each of the three periodontopathogenic bacteria were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with species-specific primers and hybridization probes. results: the plaque samples were divided into four groups based on the presence or absence of a periodontal pocket (probing depth [pd] > or =4 mm) and bleeding on probing (bop), regardless of attachment loss. the proportions of all three target bacteria detected in samples from sites of periodontal disease (with pd and bop) were markedly higher than those in the other sample groups. cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia in the subgingival plaque of each sampling site were significantly mutually correlated and were increased in the plaque of sites of periodontal disease with pd > or =4 mm and bop. conclusion: the symbiotic effects of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, which coaggregate and exist concomitantly in subgingival biofilms, may be associated with the local development of periodontitis.

AB == it is unclear when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity. therefore, we report here the association between specific age groups and the time when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity in such groups. findings are based on an epidemiological analysis of the prevalence of five periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of a wide range of age populations, from newborn to elderly, who were randomly selected in a geographic region of brazil. these periodontal pathogens include campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia and were analyzed in the bacterial samples isolated from gingival sulcus, the dorsum of the tongue, and cheek mucosa of diverse age groups, using a bacterial dna-specific pcr method. results indicated that there are distinct age-related groups where initial colonization by the five periodontal pathogens examined in this study can be detected and that the presence of teeth is a permissive factor for colonization by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia. although it remains unclear exactly how or when target pathogens colonize healthy subjects, an understanding of age-related groups does provide a potentially useful tool in the early detection and prevention of periodontitis in healthy individuals.

AB == introduction: this study aimed to measure the levels of interleukin-18 (il-18) in inflamed shallow sites and inflamed deep sites in patients with periodontitis and to compare the data with results from inflamed shallow sites in patients with gingivitis. a secondary aim was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in the sampled sites. methods: gingival crevicular fluid was collected from five gingivitis sites and five periodontitis sites from 18 patients with chronic periodontitis, and from five gingivitis sites from 15 patients with gingivitis. samples from each site category were pooled and il-18 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the subgingival microbiota was analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid volumes were higher in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites from patients with periodontitis and gingivitis. the total amount of il-18 was higher in periodontitis sites than gingivitis sites in both periodontitis (p = 0.018) and gingivitis (p = 0.002) patients and was higher in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients than in those from gingivitis patients (p = 0.015). there were higher levels of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola (red complex species) in periodontitis sites compared with gingivitis sites in both the periodontitis and gingivitis patients (p < 0.001). conclusion: levels of il-18 were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis, even at sites with similar pocket depths. the presence of similar levels of red complex species in gingivitis sites from periodontitis patients and from gingivitis patients suggested that the higher levels of il-18 were not associated with a different microbial challenge.

AB == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

AB == the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between endodontic clinical signs and symptoms and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia or their association by nested polymerase chain reaction assay. microbial samples were taken from 50 cases with necrotic pulp tissues in primary infections. dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens by using species-specific primers. p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia were detected in 46%, 38%, and 22% of the symptomatic cases, respectively. the bacterial complex composed by t forsythia, p gingivalis, and t denticola was found in 14% of the cases with spontaneous pain, tenderness to percussion, swelling, and pain on palpation. the high prevalence of p gingivalis, t denticola, and t forsythia in the samples examined suggests that these bacteria are related to the etiology of symptomatic periradicular diseases.

AB == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI == benefits of additional courses of systemic azithromycin in periodontal disease case report.
AB == the strong association of subgingival anaerobic bacteria, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia, with destructive periodontal disease has been well documented in the literature. several double-blind studies have also shown the beneficial use of systemic antimicrobials that are active against these microorganisms in conjunction with conventional periodontal treatment, especially when periodontal abscesses and/or suppuration upon probing are present. four cases with periodontal abscesses were treated with scaling/root planing in conjunction with systemic azithromycin. partial improvement led to retreatment with two additional courses of azithromycin. bone formation was noted on periapical radiographs after the patients took additional courses of azithromycin. in view of the benefits of using additional courses of azithromycin in the treatment of destructive periodontal disease, we conclude that the single course of systemic antimicrobials currently used in periodontal therapy may be insufficient to reach necessary therapeutic levels in infected sites.

AB == aim: this study sought clinical and microbial risk indicators for progressing slight periodontitis. material and methods: one hundred and seventeen periodontally healthy or slight periodontitis adults (20-40 years) were monitored clinically at 6-month intervals followed by supragingival cleaning. inter-proximal sites with >1.5 mm increase in clinical attachment over 18 months were considered disease active. subgingival plaque was analysed by 78 16s rdna and 38 whole-genomic dna probes and by pcr to porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. characteristics were compared between active and inactive subjects. results: twenty-two subjects showed disease activity principally at molars. mean baseline gingival and plaque indices, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level (cal) were higher in active subjects. dna probes detected species and not-yet-cultivated phylotypes from chronic periodontitis, although few species were associated with active subjects. by pcr p. gingivalis (p=0.007) and t. forsythia (p=0.075) were detected more frequently during monitoring in active subjects. stepwise logistic analysis associated baseline levels of gingival index, clinical attachment and bleeding with subsequent clinical attachment loss. conclusions: gingivitis and cal were significantly associated with progressing slight periodontitis in 20--40-year-old adults. species associated with moderate and advanced chronic periodontitis were detected in slight periodontitis.

TI == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens, t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

AB == background: in recent years, many researchers have focused their attention on the ability of periodontal pathogens to colonize atheromatous plaques. nevertheless, a clear correlation between the detection rates of periodontopathic bacterial dna in atheromas and in subgingival plaque samples has not been established. the aim of our study was to assess the presence of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia [formerly tannerella forsythensis]) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same patients. methods: thirty-three patients with advanced chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy were enrolled in the study. dna was extracted from subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas. universal bacteria primers for general detection of bacteria and species-specific primers for detection of periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target microorganism. the prevalence of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 69.7%, 63.6%, 54.5%, 45.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. bacterial dna was detected in 31 out of 33 endarterectomy specimens. however, none of the samples tested positive for dna from periodontal pathogens. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation; thus, no correlation could be drawn between periodontitis bacteria and microorganisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions.

AB == background: the objective of this trial was to measure the antimicrobial effects  of a minocycline hcl microsphere (mm) local drug-delivery system when used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp). dna probe analysis for 40 bacteria was used to evaluate the oral bacteria of 127 subjects with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis. methods: subjects were randomly assigned to either srp alone (n = 65) or mm + srp (n = 62). the primary endpoints of this study were changes in numbers and proportions of the red-complex bacteria (rcb) and the sum of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formally t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola relative to 40 oral bacteria at each test site from baseline to day 30. numbers of rcb from the five test sites were averaged to provide a value for each subject. results: mm + srp reduced the proportion of rcb by 6.49% and the numbers by 9.4 x 10(5). the reduction in rcb proportions and numbers by srp alone (5.03% and 5.1 x 10(5), respectively) was significantly less. in addition, mm + srp reduced probing depth by 1.38 mm (compared to 1.01 mm by srp alone), bleeding on probing was reduced by 25.2% (compared to 13.8% by srp alone), and a clinical attachment level gain of 1.16 mm (compared to 0.80 mm by srp alone) was achieved. conclusion: these observations support the hypothesis that rcbs are responsible for periodontal disease and that local antimicrobial therapy using mm + srp effectively reduces numbers of rcbs and their proportions to a greater extent than srp alone.

AB == introduction: periodontitis-associated microbiotas differ in regions around the world and vary with a variety of factors. this suggests that each country must establish its own dental microbiobiotic profile in order to formulate adequate prevention measures and more specific treatments. objective: the prevalence and proportions of the following microorganisms were investigated: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, micromonas micros, fusobacterium spp, dialister pneumosintes and enteric rods. the patients selected had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis from clinical populations in bogota, colombia. the variables of age, gender and socioeconomic level were included in the comparisons. materials and methods: 183 patients were classified in two groups, chronic periodontitis (n=84) and aggressive periodontitis (n=59); 40 healthy subjects were selected for comparison. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the 6 deepest periodontal pockets in every patient and processed by culture for the isolation and identification of bacteria. results: in chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, fusobacterium spp and e. corrodens showed high and similar prevalence, whereas m. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, d. pneumosintes and enteric rods (commonly from the tribe klebsielleae) showed less and similar prevalence. in the healthy group, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus and fusobacterium spp showed high frequency whereas m. micros and e. corrodens showed moderate frequency. conclusions: porphyromonas gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, fusobacterium spp. and e. corrodens are important constituents of the microbiologic profile of the periodontitis in colombian populations. porphyromonas gingivalis was found more frequently than a. actinomycetemcomitans in aggressive periodontitis.

AB == background: information on bacterial colonization immediately after dental implant insertion is limited. aims: (1) to assess the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement and throughout the first 12 post-surgical weeks, (2) to compare the microbiota at interproximal subgingival implant and adjacent tooth sites. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from implant and neighbouring teeth were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization before surgery, 30 min after implant placement, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. results: comparing bacterial loads at implant sites between 30 min after placement with 1-week data showed that only the levels of veillonella parvula (p<0.05) differed with higher loads at week 1 post-surgically. week 12 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for 15/40 species at tooth sites compared with pre-surgery (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.01). between the period immediately after surgery and 12 weeks at implant sites, 29/40 species was more commonly found at 12 weeks. included among these bacteria at implant sites were porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.05), tannerella forsythia, (p<0.01), and treponema denticola (p<0.001). immediately post-surgery 5.9% of implants, and 26.2% of teeth, and at week 12, 15% of implants, and 39.1% of teeth harbored staphylococcus aureus. comparing tooth and implant sites, significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for 27/40 species after 30 min following implant placement. this difference increased to 35/40 species at 12 weeks post-surgically. conclusions: bacterial colonization occurred within 30 min after implant placement. early colonization patterns differed between implant and tooth surfaces.

AB == background: few studies examining the association between periodontal diseases and preterm birth have explored the underlying microbial and antibody responses associated with oral infection. methods: a nested case-control study was performed using data from a recent interventional trial following the delayed-treatment control group of 31 subjects with periodontal diseases. the levels of eight oral bacteria and the maternal immunoglobulin g (igg) responses in serum to these bacteria were measured at antepartum and postpartum visits to determine the relationship to cases (preterm delivery <37 weeks' gestation) and controls (term delivery). results: antepartum, the levels of periodontal pathogens tended to be higher in the preterm (case group) deliveries compared to the term deliveries (control group). maternal anti-porphyromonas gingivalis igg was significantly lower in the preterm group compared to the term group (p = 0.028). postpartum, levels of p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were statistically significantly higher in preterm births compared to term deliveries, adjusting for baseline levels. the joint effects of red and orange microbial clusters were significantly higher in the preterm group compared to the term group. conclusions: high levels of periodontal pathogens and low maternal igg antibody response to periodontal bacteria during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for preterm delivery. further studies elucidating the role of the microbial load and maternal immune response as related to pregnancy outcome seem merited.

AB == aim: in the last years the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular  diseases has been a subject of increasing research. the identification of periodontopathic bacteria in atheromas can contribute to our knowledge of such an association. the aim of our study was to assess the concomitant presence of 5 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same individuals. methods: twenty-one patients with chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy for carotid stenosis were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas were examined using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization techniques by means of specific probes for periodontal bacteria. human beta-globin amplification was used as internal polymerase chain reaction efficiency control. results: three patients were excluded because the endarterectomy specimens were negative to dna amplification. all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target micro-organism. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 72.22%, 61.11%, 55.56%, 50%, and 33.33%, respectively. no periodontal bacteria dna was detected in any endarterectomy specimen. conclusions: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation and, thus, no correlation between periodontitis bacteria and micro-organisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions could be drawn.

TI == identification of intracellular oral species within human crevicular epithelial cells from subjects with chronic periodontitis by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB == background and objective: interactions between oral bacteria and gingival epithelial cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. this study used in situ hybridization with 16 rrna probes and confocal microscopy to detect the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola within epithelial cells from periodontal pockets, gingival crevice, and buccal mucosa collected from subjects with chronic periodontitis (n = 14) and good periodontal health (n = 8). material and methods: each green fluorescent species-specific and universal probe was hybridized with all 58 epithelial samples from the 22 patients. the samples were observed by confocal microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization of oral species of bacteria. the mean frequency of detection and number of intracellular bacteria per epithelial cell were computed for each sample. results: the frequency of cells with internalized bacteria was higher in samples from the gingival crevice than in samples from the oral mucosa. epithelial cells from all subjects harbored intracellular bacteria; however, patients with periodontitis presented significantly higher counts of bacteria per cell than periodontally healthy individuals (p < 0.05). periodontal pathogens showed a trend to be detected in higher numbers in epithelial cells from periodontitis patients. in particular, t. forsythia and t. denticola were significantly more prevalent in periodontal pocket cells than healthy sulci and buccal cell samples in the periodontitis group (p < 0.05). conclusion: those findings indicate that crevicular and buccal cells present internalized bacteria, regardless of periodontal status. however, higher bacterial loads are detected in cells from subjects with periodontitis.

AB == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with different transmucosal implant surfaces in dogs. methods: three experimental and one control single-stage implants were randomly placed on each side of the jaw in eight dogs. the transmucosal portion of the test implants consisted of an acid-etched surface (type a), a machined surface with a circumferential groove (type c) and a surface prepared by mild anodic oxidation (type d). the control was a standard machined surface (type b). in order to determine the response to the different surfaces, plaque control was carried out twice weekly following placement of the implants for the entire period of the experiment. at 6 months, gingival biopsies and plaque samples were obtained. the area of inflammatory infiltrate and the nature of the infiltrating cell types were determined using immunohistology. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify putative periodontal pathogens. results: inflammatory infiltrates were associated with all implant surfaces and were commonly found subepithelially and perivascularly. t cells were the predominant infiltrating cell type in all lesions, associated with the different surfaces. in all lesions the cd4 : cd8 ratio was approximately 2 : 1. statistical analysis showed that the type c surface (machined surface with a groove) had significantly larger inflammatory infiltrates than the type b surface (machined surface without a groove; p<0.05). no statistically significant differences were found with respect to the size of the inflammatory infiltrates or in terms of the nature of infiltrating cells. however, despite the intensive plaque control regime, plaque was present on all implant surfaces at the time of biopsy 6 months after placement. all implants had similar numbers of tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, was not detected in any sample. conclusions: these results suggest that the development of inflammation associated with implants is independent of surface type, but is nevertheless associated with the presence of plaque. the different surfaces had no influence on the nature of the infiltrate, with t cells being the predominant cell type in all lesions. finally, the different implant surface types seemed not to influence the peri-implant microbiota. however, the presence of the circumferential groove tended to be associated with larger infiltrates. whether this is due to increased plaque accumulation remains to be determined.

AB == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

AB == periodontitis are mixed bacterial infections leading to destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, including periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. among over 500 bacterial species living in the oral cavity, a bacterial complex named "red complex" and made of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia has been strongly related to advanced periodontal lesions. while periodontopathogenic bacteria are the primary etiologic factor of periodontitis, tissue destruction essentially results from the host immune response to the bacterial challenge. members of the red complex are gram negative anaerobic bacteria expressing numerous virulence factors allowing bacteria to colonize the subgingival sites, to disturb the host defense system, to invade and destroy periodontal tissue as well as to promote the immunodestructive host response. this article reviews current knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of bacteria of the red complex leading to tissue and alveolar bone destruction observed during periodontitis.

AB == introduction: dental plaque is organized in a biofilm complex that provides protection and nutrients for periodontopathic bacteria. several factors can affect microbial colonization, including restorations and orthodontic brackets. the aim of this study was to investigate changes in subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters before and after bracket placement. methods: clinical parameters and subgingival microbial samples were collected from 30 patients before and after bracket placement. thirty additional patients with no orthodontic treatment served as controls. samples were cultured and analyzed for periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria. a descriptive analysis was conducted, and chi-square, student t, wilcoxon matched, and mann whitney rank sum tests were used to test for differences between groups (p < or=.05). results: no changes in probing depth or clinical attachment level were observed, but scores for bleeding on probing, plaque index, and gingival index increased after bracket placement (p < or =.05). porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium species were elevated in the experimental group after bracket placement compared with the control group (p < or =.01). superinfecting microorganisms such as enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens were also found. conclusions: bracket placement influences the accumulation of plaque and the colonization of important periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria, resulting in more inflammation and bleeding. special attention should be paid to oral hygiene methods in orthodontic patients.

TI == levels of matrix metalloproteinases-8 and -9 with simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cholesterol in blood.
AB == background and objectives: to investigate the levels of matrix metalloproteinase  (mmp) -8 and -9 with the simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) as well as mmp-9 and cholesterol in blood. although bacterial pathogens are required to initiate the periodontal disease process, in some individuals the reaction to bacteria may lead to an excessive host response, resulting in a general inflammatory response. methods: mmp-9 and lipids were analyzed from the blood samples of 33 subjects with a 16-year history and oral health records of periodontal disease as well as from 31 periodontally healthy controls. information was obtained on education, body mass index, and family history of atherosclerosis. gcf was taken to determine mmp-8 and mmp-9 levels, and bacterial samples were simultaneously collected for polymerase chain reaction assessment of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. analysis of variance, chi-squared test, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the results. results: demographic data showed significant differences between patients and controls in smoking (p < 0.01), body mass index (p < 0.05), family history of atherosclerotic disease (p < 0.01), and education (p < 0.01). significant differences were also observed in oral health data, in the detection of p. gingivalis (p < 0.001), p. intermedia (p < 0.01), p. nigrescens (p < 0.001), and t. forsythia (p < 0.001) and in the levels of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gcf between patients and controls. t. forsythia[odds ratio(or) 10.1; p = 0.001] and age (or 5.54; p = 0.008) appeared to be the main independent predictors for high mmp-8 in gcf. patients had significantly higher total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.05), and triglycerides (p < = 0.01) than controls. plasma levels of mmp-9 were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p = 0.001). conclusions: specific periodontal microorganisms appeared to induce host response, with increased release of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gingival pockets as well as of mmp-9 in plasma, possibly triggering its up-regulation in blood.

TI == porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles enhance attachment, and the leucine-rich repeat bspa protein is required for invasion of epithelial cells by "tannerella forsythia".
AB == the human oral cavity harbors more than 500 species of bacteria. periodontitis, a bacterially induced inflammatory disease that leads to tooth loss, is believed to result from infection by a select group of gram-negative periodontopathogens that includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and "tannerella forsythia" (opinion on name change from tannerella forsythensis pending; formerly bacteroides forsythus). epithelial cell invasion by periodontopathogens is considered to be an important virulence mechanism for evasion of the host defense responses. further, the epithelial cells with invading bacteria also serve as reservoirs important in recurrent infections. the present study was therefore undertaken to address the epithelial cell adherence and invasion properties of t. forsythia and the role of the cell surface-associated protein bspa in these processes. further, we were interested in determining if p. gingivalis, one of the pathogens frequently found associated in disease, or its outer membrane vesicles (omvs) could modulate the epithelial cell adherence and invasion abilities of t. forsythia. here we show that epithelial cell attachment and invasion by t. forsythia are dependent on the bspa protein. in addition, p. gingivalis or its omvs enhance the attachment and invasion of t. forsythia to epithelial cells. thus, interactions between these two bacteria may play important roles in virulence by promoting host cell attachment and invasion.

TI == association of eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s. intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

AB == objectives: to assess the microbiological outcome of local administration of minocycline hydrochloride microspheres 1 mg (arestin) in cases with peri-implantitis and with a follow-up period of 12 months. material and methods: after debridement, and local administration of chlorhexidine gel, peri-implantitis cases were treated with local administration of minocycline microspheres (arestin). the dna-dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to detect bacterial presence during the first 360 days of therapy. results: at day 10, lower bacterial loads for 6/40 individual bacteria including actinomyces gerensceriae (p<0.1), actinomyces israelii (p<0.01), actinomyces naeslundi type 1 (p<0.01) and type 2 (p<0.03), actinomyces odontolyticus (p<0.01), porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.01) and treponema socranskii (p<0.01) were found. at day 360 only the levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were lower than at baseline (mean difference: 1x10(5); se difference: 0.34x10(5), 95% ci: 0.2x10(5) to 1.2x10(5); p<0.03). six implants were lost between days 90 and 270. the microbiota was successfully controlled in 48%, and with definitive failures (implant loss and major increase in bacterial levels) in 32% of subjects. conclusions: at study endpoint, the impact of arestin on a. actinomycetemcomitans was greater than the impact on other pathogens. up to day 180 reductions in levels of tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were also found. failures in treatment could not be associated with the presence of specific pathogens or by the total bacterial load at baseline. statistical power analysis suggested that a case control study would require approximately 200 subjects.

TI == treponema denticola in disseminating endodontic infections.
AB == treponema denticola is a consensus periodontal pathogen that has recently been associated with endodontic pathology. in this study, the effect of mono-infection of the dental pulp with t. denticola and with polymicrobial "red-complex" organisms (rc) (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and t. denticola) in inducing disseminating infections in wild-type (wt) and severe-combined-immunodeficiency (scid) mice was analyzed. after 21 days, a high incidence (5/10) of orofacial abscesses was observed in scid mice mono-infected with t. denticola, whereas abscesses were rare in scid mice infected with the red-complex organisms or in wild-type mice. splenomegaly was present in all groups, but only mono-infected scid mice had weight loss. t. denticola dna was detected in the spleen, heart, and brain of mono-infected scid mice and in the spleen from mono-infected wild-type mice, which also had more periapical bone resorption. the results indicate that t. denticola has high pathogenicity, including dissemination to distant organs, further substantiating its potential importance in oral and linked systemic conditions.

TI == inflammation, heat shock proteins and periodontal pathogens in atherosclerosis: an immunohistologic study.
AB == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI == the additional value of real-time pcr in the quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens.
AB == background and aim: for the analysis of subgingival plaque, anaerobic bacterial culture has been the gold standard for many years. currently, molecular microbial techniques have become available to identify and quantify target organisms with high specificity and sensitivity. the technique of real-time polymerase chain reaction(rt-pcr) provides a new tool to detect oral pathogens both in oral and non-oral human infections. the aim of this study was to compare the rt-pcr and anaerobic culture for detection and quantification of six periodontal pathogens in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from 259 adult patients with periodontitis and 111 healthy controls were analysed with quantitative anaerobic culture and quantitative rt-pcr for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, micromonas micros and fusobacterium spp. results: all species were more frequently isolated from patients than controls with both culture and rt-pcr. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and m. micros appeared significant markers for disease with both techniques. p. intermedia was significantly associated with periodontitis by rt-pcr only (or 9.7), whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans showed a significant relationship by culture only. the critical differences between culture and rt-pcr were culture-negative/pcr-positive samples which amounted to 7% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 3% for p. gingivalis, 7% for t. forsythia, 20% for p. intermedia, 6% for m. micros, and 0.8% for fusobacterium spp. in periodontitis patients and 12%, 3%, 2%, 35%, 14% and 0%, respectively, in the periodontally healthy group. furthermore, periodontitis individuals had significantly higher amount of all of the test species in the subgingival plaque samples compared with healthy subjects. conclusion: rt-pcr provides a new rapid diagnostic tool and opens the opportunity to detect small numbers of oral pathogens in clinical specimens, which are under the detection limit by culture technique.

AB == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. in addition, the relationship between the number of teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of 85-year-old people was assessed. subjects and methods: two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. five periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. results: periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for p. gingivalis (p<0.0001), t. denticola (p<0.001), f. nucleatum (p=0.002), and t. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or s. mutans (p=0.147). conclusions: a wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. it was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. there was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that tongue care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.

TI == subgingival and tongue microbiota during early periodontitis.
AB == periodontal infections have a microbial etiology. association of species with early disease would be useful in determining which microbes initiate periodontitis. we hypothesized that the microbiota of subgingival and tongue samples would differ between early periodontitis and health. a cross-sectional evaluation of 141 healthy and early periodontitis adults was performed with the use of oligonucleotide probes and pcr. most species differed in associations with sample sites; most subgingival species were associated with subgingival samples. few species were detected more frequently in early periodontitis by dna probes. porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (tannerella forsythensis) were associated with early periodontitis by direct pcr. in conclusion, the microbiota of tongue samples was less sensitive than that of subgingival samples in detecting periodontal species, and there was overlap in species detected in health and early periodontitis. detection of periodontal pathogens in early periodontitis suggests an etiology similar to that of more advanced disease.

TI == anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. the continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (lps) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and escherichia coli. interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (rantes) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by lps was evaluated by elisa. our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lps. this suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.

TI == inhibition of periodontopathogen-derived proteolytic enzymes by a high-molecular-weight fraction isolated from cranberry.
AB == background: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola are three major aetiological agents of chronic periodontitis. the strong proteolytic activities of these bacteria are critical to their survival since their energy source is obtained from peptides and amino acids derived from proteins. in addition, proteases are important factors contributing to periodontal tissue destruction by a variety of mechanisms, including direct tissue degradation and modulation of host inflammatory responses. objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialysable material (ndm) prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the proteolytic activities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola. methods: the effect of ndm on gingipain and dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv) activities of p. gingivalis, trypsin-like activity of t. forsythia and chymotrypsin-like activity of t. denticola was evaluated using synthetic chromogenic peptides. in addition, the capacity of p. gingivalis to degrade fluorescein-labelled type i collagen and fluorescein-labelled transferrin in the presence of ndm was evaluated by fluorometry. results: ndm dose-dependently inhibited the proteinases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola as well as type i collagen and transferrin degradation by p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that ndm has the potential to reduce either the proliferation of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola in periodontal pockets or their proteinase-mediated destructive process occurring in periodontitis.

AB == background: of the many forms of periodontal disease, refractory periodontal diseases are the least characterized. they are defined as the continued degeneration of the periodontium despite adequate management. this has led to the suggestion that there may be a systemic component that is a contributing factor to the development of this condition. the objectives of this report were to follow the progression of clinical changes associated with periodontal disease over a number of years in this unique population and review various hematologic and microbiologic factors that may be contributing to the disease progression. methods: three subjects were profiled. they were referred to the refractory periodontal disease unit at the university of toronto by periodontists or general practitioners in the southern ontario region. complete medical and dental histories were obtained along with baseline clinical measurements. periodontal examinations were facilitated with the use of a computer-assisted periodontal probe. a microbiologic analysis using immunofluorescence techniques was able to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and spirochetes. a hematologic analysis, including a complete blood count (cbc), immune profile, and glycosylated hemoglobin assay, was also performed. results: the clinical presentation revealed that patients receiving adequate maintenance therapy and with good to excellent oral hygiene demonstrated sites with continual loss of attachment. few periodontal pathogens were detected. however, the most significant finding appeared to be the report elevated levels of cd8+ cells within this group of patients compared to normal laboratory ranges. conclusions: this report is an attempt at characterizing a unique population within the periodontal realm. the long-term monitoring of these patients allowed for an assessment of factors that may be involved in the continued decline of the periodontal health of these patients. based on the immune profile, it is possible that a hyperresponsive state may be the primary feature of this population. future assessments, including full-mouth interleukin (il)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-8 levels, may assist in characterizing this population further, with the goal of producing markers that will assist clinicians in predicting treatment outcome.

TI == inflammatory responses of a macrophage/epithelial cell co-culture model to mono and mixed infections with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia.
AB == accumulated evidence points to porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as three major etiologic agents of chronic periodontitis. epithelial cells and macrophages play a major role in the host response to periodontopathogens, and the secretion of inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) by these host cells is believed to contribute to periodontal tissue destruction. the aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory response of a macrophage/epithelial cell co-culture model following mono or mixed infections with the above three periodontopathogens. an in vitro co-culture model composed of epithelial-like transformed cells (hela cell line) and macrophage-like cells (phorbol myristic acid-differentiated u937 monocytic cell line) was challenged with whole cells or lipopolysaccharides (lps) of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, individually and in combination. following stimulation, the production of interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), regulated on activation normal t cell expressed and secreted (rantes), prostaglandin e2 (pge2), and mmp-9 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassays. we observed that mono or mixed infections of the co-culture model induced the secretion of il-1beta, il-6, il-8, pge2, and mmp-9. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia induced an increase in rantes secretion, whereas t. denticola alone or in combination resulted in a significant decrease in rantes levels. all lps challenges induced an increase in chemokine, mmp-9, and pge2 production. no synergistic effect on the production of cytokines, chemokines, pge2, and mmp-9 was observed for any of the bacterial or lps mixtures tested. this study supports the view that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia may induce high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and mmp-9 in periodontal lesions, thus contributing to the progression of periodontitis.

AB == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI == [efficacy variation of erythromycin and spiramycin on periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis. an in vitro comparative study].
AB == aims: erythromycin (ery) and spiramycin (spi) are the most frequently prescribed  macrolides by dentists. however, the emergence of resistant anaerobic subgingival bacteria imposes an increased vigilance. this study aims to compare these macrolides efficacy on principal periopathogens. materials and methods: twenty adult patients with aggressive periodontitis were selected and a total of 60 samples were taken from subgingival flora. bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were isolated according to j. slots's rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to ery and spi were studied using disk diffusion susceptibility test and minimum inhibitory concentration test (mic test). results: the efficiency variability of ery and spi on the 50 isolated anaerobic periopathogens was present either interindividually (between different patients) and intra-individually (within the same patient). while 68% of the tested anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to spi (22% resistant), only 54% were sensitive to ery (34% resistant). although moderate, the efficacy of spi seemed more regular in general than ery: it's variation coefficient (40%) is lower than the ery one (53%). the 7 a. actinomycetemcomitans tested showed all a high resistance. conclusion: in a general way, the spectre of activity of spi is stacked in that of ery. however, this study shows a better and regular activity of spi on the main tested periopathogens. these results are in favour of the use of spi in periodontology when penicillins and doxycycline are not useful because specific problems are identified (allergy, pregnancy...).

TI == prevalence of putative periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques from gingivitis lesions in korean orthodontic patients.
AB == the objective of this study was to detect and compare the presence of periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaques of gingivitis lesions in adults who wore fixed orthodontic appliances, as opposed to adults who did not wear any orthodontic appliances. thirty-six individuals participated in this study. nineteen of these subjects did not wear any orthodontic appliances, and these subjects comprised the control group. the other 17 individuals had been wearing fixed orthodontic appliances for at least 3 months each. after a periodontal examination, we collected subgingival plaque samples from the gingivitis lesions of each patient. using pcr based on 16s rdna, we detected the presence of 6 putative periodontopathogenic species, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. with regard to the presence of individual periodontopathogens, we found that t. forsythia, t. denticola, and p. nigrescens were significantly more common in the samples obtained from the orthodontic patients than in the samples obtained from the non-orthodontic patient controls. our results indicate that the local changes associated with the wearing of fixed orthodontic appliances may affect the prevalence of periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques.

TI == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI == antimicrobial susceptibility variation of 50 anaerobic periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis: an interindividual variability study.
AB == background/aims: the frequent use of antibiotics in developed countries has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance. in this study, the interindividual variability of the antibiotic susceptibility of 50 putative microorganisms in aggressive periodontitis patients has been evaluated by means of vc (variation coefficient). material and methods: a total of 60 microbial samples were collected from 20 adult patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (2-4 samples by patient). bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus micros were isolated according to slots' rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to 10 antibiotics were studied: penicillin g (pen), ampicillin (amp), amoxicillin (amx), amoxicillin/clavulanate (amc), tetracycline (tet), doxycycline (dox), ciprofloxacin (cip), erythromycin (ery), spiramycin (spi) and clindamycin (clin), using the disk diffusion susceptibility test (dds test: kirby-bauer's modified method for anaerobic bacteria). the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration test was carried out as a control test. results: among the 50 identified bacteria, 15 were p. gingivalis, 12 p. intermedia, 8 t. forsythia, 9 f. nucleatum, and 6 p. micros. the results of the dds test show that penicillins (especially amc, amp, and amx), cyclines (especially dox) and clin are highly effective against the 50 anaerobic studied bacteria. cip and ery have the lowest efficacy against those bacteria. cip shows a very variable activity according to anaerobic bacteria species, being particularly inactive against p. gingivalis and very efficient against t. forsythia and p. micros. spi is also highly efficient but not against p. micros. conclusions: the interindividual susceptibility of principal periodontal pathogens to antibiotics is not homogeneous and seems to vary according to bacterial species and antimicrobial molecules. this variability seems to be greater with older molecules (pen, tet, ery) than with more recent ones, which indicates more stable results (amc, amx, amp, and dox). p. intermedia appeared to be the bacteria most resistant to penicillins and showed the highest coefficient variation. together with scaling and root planing, the combination of two antibiotics would therefore seem to be recommended in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis, particularly in the presence of p. intermedia.

AB == we assessed the salivary levels of periodontopathic bacteria and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) in patients with periodontitis. the salivary levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus) were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. the 8-ohdg levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the salivary levels of 8-ohdg, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. by contrast, the a. actinomycetemcomitans level in healthy subjects was higher than that in periodontitis patients. 8-ohdg was significantly correlated with p. gingivalis. statistically significant decreases in the levels of p. gingivalis, probing depth, bleeding on probing, and 8-ohdg were observed after initial periodontal treatment. these results suggest that the 8-ohdg levels in saliva reflect the load of periodontal pathogens. 8-ohdg could be a useful biomarker for assessing periodontal status accurately, and for evaluating the efficacy of periodontal treatment.

TI == loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of the periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola.
AB == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), a novel nucleic acid amplification method, was developed for the rapid detection of the major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. the lamp method amplifies dna with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set of four specially designed primers and a dna polymerase with strand displacement activity. in this study, we initially designed the primers for lamp assays to detect these bacteria and evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of these assays. the specificities of the primers for these bacteria were examined using various oral bacteria and various reaction times. the lower detection limits of the 60-min lamp reaction without loop primers were 1 microg/tube for p. gingivalis, 10 fg/tube for t. forsythia, and 1 ng/tube for t. denticola. addition of the loop primers for each bacterium improved the detection specificities and sensitivities by several magnitudes. furthermore, lamp assays were applied to the rapid detection of these periodontal pathogens in clinical specimens, and the results were compared with those of conventional pcr detection. the results of the lamp assays corresponded to those of conventional pcr assays. these results indicate that the lamp assay is an extremely rapid, highly sensitive, specific method. this method is very useful for the rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria and the diagnosis of periodontal disease.

AB == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI == stimulation of growth of porphyromonas gingivalis by cell extracts from tannerella forsythia.
AB == objective: in order to examine if tannerella forsythia stimulates the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, an in vitro study was performed. background: p. gingivalis and t. forsythia are often isolated simultaneously from active periodontitis sites, indicating that these bacteria somewhat interact in the periodontal environment. we reported previously that mixed infection of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia synergistically induced lesion formation in a murine abscess model, and gingipains of p. gingivalis played an important role in this synergism. one of the possible mechanisms of this synergism is growth promotion by coinfection of the two bacteria. methods: cell extracts of t. forsythia were added to the nutrition-decreased medium and the promotion of growth of p. gingivalis was examined. results: sonicated extract of t. forsythia stimulated growth of p. gingivalis in nutrition-decreased medium in a dose-dependent manner. proteins appeared to be the nature of growth-promoting factor, and the cell extract of t. forsythia had no stimulating effect on the growth of p. gingivalis strain devoid of gingipain activities. conclusion: a product or a component of t. forsythia seemed to stimulate growth of p. gingivalis under nutrition-limited conditions. gingipains are considered to play an important role in digestion or uptake of this growth-promoting factor. the interaction between t. forsythia and p. gingivalis in growth may be in part related with the synergistic virulence in a murine model.

AB == tannerella forsythia has been implicated as a defined periodontal pathogen. in the present study a mouse model was used to determine the phenotype of leukocytes in the lesions induced by subcutaneous injections of either live (group a) or nonviable (group b) t. forsythia. control mice (group c) received the vehicle only. lesions were excised at days 1, 2, 4, and 7. an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used to stain infiltrating cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, cd14+ macrophages, cd19+ b cells, and neutrophils. hematoxylin and eosin sections demonstrated lesions with central necrotic cores surrounded by neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in both group a and group b mice. lesions from control mice exhibited no or only occasional solitary leukocytes. in both groups a and b, neutrophils were the dominant leukocyte in the lesion 1 day after injection, the numbers decreasing over the 7-day experimental period. there was a relatively low mean percent of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in the lesions and, whereas the percent of cd8+ t cells remained constant, there was a significant increase in the percent of cd4+ t cells at day 7. this increase was more evident in group a mice. the mean percent of cd14+ macrophages and cd19+ b cells remained low over the experimental period, although there was a significantly higher mean percent of cd19+ b cells at day 1. in conclusion, the results showed that immunization of mice with live t. forsythia induced a stronger immune response than nonviable organisms. the inflammatory response presented as a nonspecific immune response with evidence of an adaptive (t-cell) response by day 7. unlike porphyromonas gingivalis, there was no inhibition of neutrophil migration.

TI == herpesviruses, the missing link between gingivitis and periodontitis?
AB == herpesviruses appear to assume a major etiopathogenic role in various types of destructive periodontal disease. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) and hcmv-ebv co-infection are closely associated with disease-active periodontitis in juveniles and adults, with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis in children, and with periodontal abscesses. in particular, hcmv reactivation in periodontitis lesions seems to be linked to advancing disease. hcmv infects periodontal monocytes/macrophages and t-lymphocytes, and ebv infects periodontal b-lymphocytes. herpesvirus-infected inflammatory cells generate a great variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may possess diminished ability to defend against bacterial challenge. herpesvirus-associated periodontal sites tend to harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including dialister pneumosintes, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in summary, the available data suggest that periodontitis occurs more frequently and progresses more rapidly in herpesvirus-infected than in non-infected periodontal sites. an infectious disease model based on herpesvirus-bacteria-host immune response interactions is presented to explain how a gingivitis lesion or a stable periodontal site with increased probing depth may convert into a tissue-destroying periodontitis lesion.

TI == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

AB == objectives: the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial profile and to seek possible bacterial associations in the subgingival microbiota of early onset periodontitis/aggressive periodontitis patients by using two different techniques, culture and immunofluorescence. material and methods: the study group consisted of 66 systemically healthy individuals with evidence of early onset periodontitis - 41 females and 25 males aged 23-35 years (mean 31.1 +/- 3.1 years). bacterial samples were collected from the deepest site in each quadrant, resulting in a total of 264 sites with a mean probing pocket depth of 6.6 +/- 1.5 mm. samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and nonselective media, and isolates were characterized to species level. indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies was applied to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (bacteroides forsythus, tannerella forsythensis), prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii. results: 93.6% of sampled sites showed bleeding on probing and 23.5% were positive for suppuration. p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and c. rectus were detected in 77.3-85.9% of samples using culture methods and in 85.6-91.3% using immunofluorescence. p. micros and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found, respectively, in 63.3% and 25.0% of all sites using culturing and in 58.7% and 27.7% sites using immunofluorescence. significantly strong positive associations were observed between t. forsythia and c. rectus (odds ratio 109.46), and t. forsythia and p. gingivalis (odd ratio 90.26), whereas a negative association was seen between p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio 0.42). coinfection by p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and c. rectus was observed in 62.1% of the test sites, and in 89.4% of the studied subjects. the sensitivity of immunofluorescence for t. forsythia, c. rectus, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis was found to be very high (0.99-0.94) using culture as the reference detection method. the agreement between culture and immunofluorescence in detecting the presence or absence of the investigated species was 85.2-88.1% for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and t. forsythia, 75.9% for a. actinomycetemcomitans and 70.4% for p. micros. conclusions: the microbial profile of the early onset/aggressive periodontitis population was complex. the agreement between the two detection methods was very high.

AB == objectives: to determine the ability of a 10% doxycycline hyclate controlled-release polymer (atridox) to suppress periodontopathic bacteria when placed subgingivally following scaling and root planing (sc/rp). methods: eight males and seven females, mean age 48 years, with moderate to advanced periodontitis participated in the study. in each patient, bilateral periodontal pockets probing 6-7 mm were randomly assigned to treatment by sc/rp + doxycycline polymer or by sc/rp alone. subgingival placement of doxycycline polymer was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. sc/rp was performed with hand instruments for at least 10 min in each study tooth. subgingival samples were collected by paper-points at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks post-treatment. culture methodology was used to isolate and identify putative periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter species, eubacterium species, fusobacterium species, peptostreptococcus micros, eikenella corrodens, staphylococcus species, enteric gram-negative rods, beta-hemolytic streptococci and yeasts. the microbiologic examination was carried out blindly. microbiological data were analyzed using a general linear model analysis of variance for within and between group effects. results: sites receiving sc/rp + doxycycline polymer and sites receiving sc/rp alone exhibited similar levels of periodontal pathogens at baseline and did not differ significantly in total viable counts and proportional recovery of periodontopathic bacteria post-treatment. conclusions: controlled-release doxycycline placed in moderate to deep periodontal pockets caused no significant additional reduction in the subgingival pathogenic microbiota compared to thorough sc/rp alone. since controlled-release doxycycline may not significantly suppress several subgingival pathogenic microorganisms and seems to possess no distinct advantage over broad-spectra, safe and inexpensive antiseptics, the rationale for its employment in periodontal therapy remains unclear.

TI == herpesviral-bacterial interrelationships in aggressive periodontitis.
AB == background: recent findings have begun to provide a basis for a causal link between herpesviruses and aggressive periodontitis. one theory is that herpesviruses cooperate with specific bacteria in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. this study examined whether the presence of herpesviruses [human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) type 1, herpes simplex virus (hsv) type 1 and 2] is associated with the presence of putative pathogenic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in aggressive periodontitis lesions. methods: the study included 18 young adults with advanced periodontitis and 16 periodontally healthy subjects from ankara, turkey. subgingival specimens pooled from two sites in each subject were collected by a periodontal curette. qualitative polymerase chain reaction methodology was used to identify herpesviruses and bacteria. chi-square tests were employed to determine statistical associations among herpesviruses, bacteria and periodontal disease. results: hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were each detected in 72-78% of the aggressive periodontitis patients. hsv-2 occurred in 17% of the periodontitis patients. ebv-1 was detected in one periodontally healthy subject. the study bacteria occurred in 78-83% (p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, c. rectus) and in 44% (p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the periodontitis samples, and in 0-19% of the samples from healthy periodontal sites. hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were positively associated with p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and c. rectus, but not with a. actinomycetemcomitans. hsv-2 was not associated with any test bacteria. conclusions: these results support the notion that the clinical outcome of some types of severe periodontal infection depends on the presence of specific herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens. our findings open the door to testing a variety of hypotheses regarding the deleterious aspects of combined herpesviral-bacterial infections in periodontal sites.
