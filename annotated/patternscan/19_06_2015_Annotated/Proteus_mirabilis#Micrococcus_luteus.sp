TI  == new mixed ligand zinc(ii) complexes based on the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate and bioactive nitrogen-donor ligands. synthesis, structure and biological properties.
AB  == starting from the precursor [zinc valproate complex] (1), new mixed ligand zinc(ii) complexes of valproic acid and nitrogen-based ligands, formulating as, [zn(valp)22,9-dmphen] (2), [zn2(valp)4(quin)2] (3), [zn(valp)2(2-ampy)2] (4), and [zn(valp)2(2-ampic)2] (5) (valp = valproate, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, quin = quinoline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, 2-ampic = 2-amino-6-picoline) were synthesized and characterized using ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c{(1)h} nmr and uv-vis spectrometry. the crystal structures of complexes 2, 3 and 4 were determined using single-crystal x-ray diffraction. the complexes  were also evaluated for their anti-bacterial activity using in-vitro agar diffusion method against three gram-positive (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus  aureus, and bacillus subtilis) and three gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis) species. complex 2 showed considerable activity against all tested microorganisms and the effect of complexation on the anti-bacterial activity of the parent ligand of 2 was also investigated. the anti-bacterial activity of 2,9-dmphen against gram-negative bacteria was enhanced upon complexation with zinc valproate. on the other hand, complexes 1 and 3 showed weak inhibition activity against the tested species and  complexes 4 and 5 didn't show any activity at all. two methods were used for testing the inhibition of ferriprotoporphyrinix bio-mineralization: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the malaria pigment which considered being the target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine and amodiaquine. results showed that the efficiency of complex 2 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 80%. the efficiency of amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 91%.

TI  == a novel c-type lysozyme from mytilus galloprovincialis: insight into innate immunity and molecular evolution of invertebrate c-type lysozymes.
AB  == a c-type lysozyme (named as mgclyz) gene was cloned from the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis. blast analysis indicated that mgclyz was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. the nucleotide sequence of mgclyz was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. the deduced mature peptide of mgclyz was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kd and a theoretical isoelectric point (pi) of 8.08. evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during  evolution. by quantitative real-time rt-pcr (qrt-pcr) analysis, mgclyz transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. the optimal temperature and  ph of recombinant mgclyz (rmgclyz) were 20 degrees c and 4, respectively. the rmgclyz displayed lytic activities against gram-positive bacteria including micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria including vibrio anguillarum, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, proteus mirabilis and bacillus aquimaris. these results suggest that mgclyz perhaps play  an important role in innate immunity of m. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

TI  == cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  == background: rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant  and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. results: petals of r. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (hela) and breast cancer (t47d) cell lines and for antiradical activity  (with dpph*). as a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (ic(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) dpph*) were demonstrated.  moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. staphylococcus. epidermidis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (candida. albicans, c. parapsilosis) was shown.  total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. five phenolic acids and six  flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. conclusion: this is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of r. rugosa petals.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  == lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. however, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct  of the tomato processing industry. in this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "bull's heart" and "cherry" varieties were analyzed against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus and trichophyton rubrum). regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis being the most susceptible one (mic: 2.5-10 mg/ml). concerning antifungal activity, "bull's heart" extracts were the most active. in  a general way c. albicans was the most susceptible species (mic: 5-10 mg/ml). the chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids,  phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.

TI  == survival of campylobacter jejuni under conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension with the support of pseudomonas spp.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major food-borne pathogen. despite causing enteritis in humans, it is a well-adapted intestinal microorganism in animals, hardly ever generating disease symptoms. nevertheless, as a true microaerophilic microorganism it is still puzzling how campylobacter cells can survive on chicken meat, the main source of human infection. in this study, we demonstrate that c. jejuni is able to withstand conditions of atmospheric oxygen tension when cocultured with pseudomonas species, major food-spoiling bacteria that are frequently found on chicken meat in rather high numbers. using an in vitro survival assay, interactions of 145 c. jejuni wild-type strains and field isolates from chicken meat, broiler feces, and human clinical samples with type strains and food isolates of pseudomonas spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, and enterococcus faecalis were studied. when inoculated alone or in coculture with proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, micrococcus luteus, or enterococcus faecalis type strains, campylobacter cells were able to survive ambient oxygen levels for no more than 18 h. in contrast, campylobacter bacteria inoculated with type strains or wild-type isolates of pseudomonas showed a prolonged aerobic survival of up to >48 h. this microbial commensalism was diverse in c. jejuni isolates from different sources; isolates from chicken meat and humans in coculture with pseudomonas putida were able to use this survival support better than fecal isolates from broilers. scanning electron microscopy revealed the development of fiberlike structures braiding p.  putida and c. jejuni cells. hence, it seems that microaerophilic c. jejuni is able to survive ambient atmospheric oxygen tension by metabolic commensalism with pseudomonas spp. this bacterium-bacterium interaction might set the basis for survival of c. jejuni on chicken meat and thus be the prerequisite step in the pathway toward human infection.

TI  == characterization of antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  == five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. twenty-two antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at terra nova bay (ross sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. escherichia coli  and proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis. none of the isolates inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus candida albicans. active antarctic isolates, identified by 16s  rdna sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-proteobacteria (6 strains). inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of antarctic marine  bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.

AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == epr investigation of compound i in proteus mirabilis and bovine liver catalases:  formation of porphyrin and tyrosyl radical intermediates.
AB  == compound i of proteus mirabilis and bovine liver catalases (pmc and blc, respectively) were studied combining epr spectroscopy and the rapid-mix freeze-quench techniques. both enzymes, when treated with peroxyacetic acid, form a catalytic intermediate which consists of an oxoferryl porphyrin pi-cation radical. in pmc this intermediate is semistable, and an unexpected reversible equilibrium under ph influence takes place between two forms of compound i with different coupling between the oxoferryl and the porphyrin pi-cation radical. at  acid ph, one form has a ferromagnetic character as in micrococcus luteus compound i. at neutral ph, another form with a much smaller coupling, reminiscent of the horse radish peroxidase compound i, is detected. the approximate midpoint, estimated for these changes in the range 5.3 < ph < 6.0, approaches the pka value of an histidyl residue. the residues possibly involved in the transformation are  discussed in terms of the known structure of pmc compound i. the epr spectrum of  blc compound i (ph 5.6), obtained in the millisecond time scale (40 ms), also showed a mixture of two forms which, most probably, correspond to two different magnetic exchange interactions, as in the case of pmc. taken together, the low-temperature electronic absorption and the epr spectra of blc compound i formed in the 0.04-15 s range show that the porphyrin pi-cation radical disappears and, instead, a tyrosyl radical is formed. endor experiments confirm our previously estimated hyperfine couplings to the c2,6 and c3,5 ring protons and the beta-methylene protons of the purported tyrosyl radical. candidates for such a tyrosyl radical are discussed in connection with the possible electron transfer pathways between the heme active site and the nadph cofactor.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

TI  == [the capacity of anaerobically grown bacteria to exchange the 2h+ of the cell for the k+ of the medium and to maintain a high k+ distribution between cell and medium].
AB  == the n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitive exchange of 2h+ of a cell for k+ of medium stable to ph, k+ activity and temperature changes has been discovered in anaerobically grown gram-negative escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium. s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus salivarius, l. lactis in the presence of exogenic energy source. this exchange in gram-negative bacteria is operating only at increase of medium osmolarity. the high k+ distribution between cell and medium has been reached during the exchange of 2h+ for one k+ and the corresponding potassium equilibrium potential is much more than the measured delta psi. in aerobically grown e. coli, s. typhimurium, brevibacterium flavum and aerobic micrococcus luteus exchange of 2h+ for k+ does not take place, the k+ distribution is lower and in good conformity with the measured delta psi. it is assumed that exchange of 2h+ for k+ in anaerobic bacteria is carried out by the h+-atpase complex and the trk (or trk-like) system of k+ absorption united into the same membrane supercomplex which functions as the h+-k+-pump and supports the high k+ distribution between cell and medium.

TI  == [reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus  luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable  (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.
