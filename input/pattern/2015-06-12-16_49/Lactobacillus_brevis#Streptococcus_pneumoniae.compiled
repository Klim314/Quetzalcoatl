TI  - Modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. We investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. METHODS: A colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to the abdominal wall through two colostomies. The loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. Lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. Actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. RESULTS: Colonisation with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. Colonisation with Lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. Bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. Permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.
TI  - Association of bacteria with the fungal fermentation of soybean tempe.
AB  - Bacteria grew to viable populations of 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g during the fermentation  of soybeans into tempe with the fungus, Rhizopus oligosporus. Bacillus pumilus and B. brevis were the predominant bacterial species, reaching populations of approximately 10(8) cfu/g during the 48 h fermentation. Species of Streptococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae also contributed to the fermentation and achieved populations of 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g.
TI  - The microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  - Soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees C underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of pH from 6.5 to 4.5. Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter diversus and Bacillus brevis, and the yeasts Pichia burtonii, Candida didensiae and Rhodotorula rubra. Fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures of these isolates showed L. casei, Strep. faecium and Staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the pH reduction. Soybeans were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation. Boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.
