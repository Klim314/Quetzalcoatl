TI  == cleavage of influenza a virus h1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  == cleavage of influenza a virus hemagglutinin (ha) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. the relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. we examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. no evidence of secreted proteases was  found for the bacterial pathogens, including haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and streptococcus suis. proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus hyicus, aeromonas caviae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterococcus sp. only p. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus ha. however, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. however, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus ha.
