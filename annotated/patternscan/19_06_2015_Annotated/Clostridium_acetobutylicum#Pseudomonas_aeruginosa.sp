TI  == measurement of biochemical oxygen demand from different wastewater samples using  a mediator-less microbial fuel cell biosensor.
AB  == microbial fuel cells (mfcs) have attracted considerable attention as potential biosensors. a mfc biosensor for rapid measurement of biochemical oxygen demand (bod) has been recently studied. however, a standardized bacterial mixture inoculated in the mfc biosensor for bod measurement is unavailable. thus, the commercial application of a mfc biosensor is limited. in this study, a mediator-less mfc biosensor inoculated with known mixed cultures to quickly determine bod concentration was tested. optimal external resistance, operating temperature and measurement time for the mfc biosensor were determined to be 5000 omega, 35 degrees c and 12h, respectively. a good relationship between bod concentration and voltage output, high reproducibility and long-term stability for the mfc biosensor was observed. the newly developed mfc biosensor was inoculated with a mixture of six bacterial strains (thermincola carboxydiphila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, ochrobactrum intermedium, shewanella frigidimarina, citrobacter freundii and clostridium acetobutylicum) capable of degrading complex organic compounds and surviving toxic conditions. the described mfc biosensor was able to successfully measure bod concentrations below 240 mg l(-1) in real wastewater samples.

TI  == the biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  == competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. these 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the  communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. in addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol).  whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some  microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: pichia anomala, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas putida; specialists such as dunaliella salina, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus spp. and other lactic  acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs gonyostomum semen and microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as rhodotorula mucilaginosa, pantoea ananatis and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as aspergillus spp., salinibacter ruber and haloquadratum walsbyi. some microbes, such as escherichia coli, mycobacterium smegmatis and pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. we propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as synodropsis spp., polypaecilum pisce, metschnikowia orientalis, salmonella spp., and caulobacter crescentus. we show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. microbial weed species are unlikely to  emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed  biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies  needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.

TI  == a wide host-range metagenomic library from a waste water treatment plant yields a novel alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase.
AB  == using dna obtained from the metagenome of an anaerobic digestor in a waste water  treatment plant, we constructed a gene library cloned in the wide host-range cosmid plafr3. one cosmid enabled rhizobium leguminosarum to grow on ethanol as sole carbon and energy source, this being due to the presence of a gene, termed adhemeta. the adhemeta protein most closely resembles the adhe alcohol dehydrogenase of clostridium acetobutylicum, where it catalyses the formation of  ethanol and butanol in a two-step reductive process. however, cloned adhemeta did not confer ethanol utilization ability to escherichia coli or to pseudomonas aeruginosa, even though it was transcribed in both these hosts. further, cell-free extracts of e. coli and r. leguminosarum containing cloned adhemeta had butanol and ethanol dehydrogenase activities when assayed in vitro. in contrast to the well-studied adhe proteins of c. acetobutylicum and e. coli, the enzyme specified by adhemeta is not inactivated by oxygen and it enables alcohol to be catabolized. cloned adhemeta did, however, confer one phenotype to e. coli. adhe- mutants of e. coli fail to ferment glucose and introduction of adhemeta restored  the growth of such mutants when grown under fermentative conditions. these observations show that the use of wide host-range vectors enhances the efficacy with which metagenomic libraries can be screened for genes that confer novel functions.
