gassericin a: a circular bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus gasseri.
during the recent years extensive efforts have been made to find out bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (lab) active against various food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, and superior stabilities against heat treatments and ph variations. bacteriocins isolated from lab have been grouped into four classes. circular bacteriocins which were earlier grouped among the four groups of bacteriocins, have recently been proposed to be classified into a different class, making it class v bacteriocins. circular bacteriocins are special molecules, whose precursors must be post translationally modified to join the n to c termini with a head-to-tail peptide bond. cyclization appears to make them less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, high temperature and ph, and, therefore, provides enhanced stability as compared to linear bacteriocins. the advantages of circularization are also reflected by the fact that a significant number of macrocyclic natural products have found pharmaceutical applications. circular bacteriocins were unknown two decades ago, and even to date, only a few circular bacteriocins from a diverse group of gram positive organisms have been reported. the first example of a circular bacteriocin was enterocin as-48, produced by enterococcus faecalis as-48. gassereccin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, reutericin 6 produced by lactobacillus reuteri la6 and circularin a, produced by clostridium beijerinickii atcc 25,752, are further examples of this group of antimicrobial peptides. in the present scenario, gassericin a can be an important tool in the food preservation owing to its properties of high ph and temperature tolerance and the fact that it is produced by lab l. gasseri, whose many strains are proven probiotic.
conjugative plasmid from lactobacillus gasseri la39 that carries genes for production of and immunity to the circular bacteriocin gassericin a.
gassericin a is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri strain la39. we found a 33,333-bp plasmid, designated plgla39, in this strain. plgla39 contained 44 open reading frames, including seven genes related to gassericin a production/immunity (gaa), as well as genes for replication, plasmid maintenance, and conjugative transfer. plgla39 was transferred from la39 to the type strain of l. gasseri (jcm 1131) by filter mating. the transconjugant exhibited >30-fold-higher more resistance to gassericin a and produced antibacterial activity. lactobacillus reuteri la6, the producer of reutericin 6, was proved to harbor a plasmid indistinguishable from plgla39 and carrying seven genes 100% identical to gaa. this suggests that plgla39 might have been transferred naturally between l. gasseri la39 and l. reuteri la6. the seven gaa genes of plgla39 were cloned into a plasmid vector to construct pgaa. jcm 1131(t) transformed with pgaa expressed antibacterial activity and resistance to gassericin a. pgaa was segregationally more stable than a pgaa derivative plasmid from which gaaa was deleted and even was more stable than the vector. this suggests the occurrence of postsegregational host killing by the gaa genes. plgla39 carried a pemik homolog, and segregational stabilization of a plasmid by the plgla39-type pemik genes was also confirmed. thus, plgla39 was proved to carry the genes for at least two plasmid maintenance mechanisms, i.e., gaa and pemik. plasmids containing a repa gene similar to plgla39 repa were distributed in several l. gasseri strains.
inhibition of food-borne pathogenic bacteria by bacteriocins from lactobacillus gasseri.
lactobacillus acidophilus group and a lact. reuteri isolated from human faeces were examined for production of antimicrobial agents against 16 strains of six species of food-borne enteric pathogenic bacteria. several strains of lact. gasseri showed wide inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria. gassericin a produced by lact. gasseri la39 was one of the most widely active bacteriocins. it was bactericidal without causing cell lysis.
