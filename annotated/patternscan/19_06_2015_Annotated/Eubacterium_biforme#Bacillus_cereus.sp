TI  == bovine intestinal bacteria inactivate and degrade ceftiofur and ceftriaxone with  multiple beta-lactamases.
AB  == the veterinary cephalosporin drug ceftiofur is rapidly degraded in the bovine intestinal tract. a cylinder-plate assay was used to detect microbiologically active ceftiofur, and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to quantify the amount of ceftiofur remaining after incubation  with bovine intestinal anaerobic bacteria, which were isolated from colon contents or feces from 8 cattle. ninety-six percent of the isolates were able to  inactivate ceftiofur to some degree, and 54% actually degraded the drug. none of  9 fungal isolates inactivated or degraded ceftiofur. facultative and obligate anaerobic bacterial species that inactivated or degraded ceftiofur were identified with vitek and biolog systems, respectively. a subset of ceftiofur degraders also degraded the chemically similar drug ceftriaxone. most of the species of bacteria that degraded ceftiofur belonged to the genera bacillus and bacteroides. pcr analysis of bacterial dna detected specific beta-lactamase genes. bacillus cereus and b. mycoides isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. seven isolates of bacteroides spp. produced multiple beta-lactamases, including possibly cepa, and metallo-beta-lactamases. isolates of eubacterium biforme, bifidobacterium breve,  and several clostridium spp. also produced ceftiofur-degrading beta-lactamases. an agar gel overlay technique on isoelectric focusing separations of bacterial lysates showed that beta-lactamase enzymes were sufficient to degrade ceftiofur.  these results suggest that ceftiofur is inactivated nonenzymatically and degraded enzymatically by multiple beta-lactamases from bacteria in the large intestines of cattle.
