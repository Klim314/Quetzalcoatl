TI  - Microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  - Awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. Using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. In this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. Monocultures of Klebsiella oxytoca and Lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. Yet, neither S. oralis or S. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from K. oxytoca on wound healing. Other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. Apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. Further mechanistic experiments with K. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. These results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  - The essential oil (EO) composition of ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi was analyzed by GC-MS. The oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). Seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). The major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). Trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Corynebacterium sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus sp., Nocardia sp. and Streptococcus group D). The essential oil of the ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi has shown to be active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/mL to 56.86 mug/mL. However, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, Gram-positive species showed greater sensitivity to the action of EO, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of Pleurostylia capensis Turcz (Loes) (celastraceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pleurostylia capensis is a large tree that can reach the maximum height of 20 m long, and it have been traditionally used as cosmetic, for steam bath, ritual body wash, and as a purgative to treat symptoms of witchcraft. Using ethanol, chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), and water extracts, leaves, bark and roots of Pleurostylia capensis were investigated scientifically for their effectiveness in antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities using standard methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis), Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium), and Candida albicans. The antioxidant activity was investigated using 2, 2-diphenlyl-1-picrylhadrazyl (DPPH), free radical scavenging assay. The anti-inflammatory activity of P. capensis extracts was evaluated against both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX 1 and 2). RESULTS: The ethyl acetate extracts of P. capensis showed a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus, K. pneumonia, S. pyogenes, and M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.39 and 0.78 mg/ml. While the ethanol bark extract was most active against M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.78 mg/ml; the least potent activity was observed with dichloromethane, chloroform and water extracts, with an MIC value ranging from 1.56 mg/ml to 50.0 mg/ml. The plant extracts proved to be good antioxidant agent, whereas extracts of ethanol were the most active, with IC50 ranging from 1.00 to 1.74 microg/ml, which is lower, and in close range to Vitamin C (1.40 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Its moderation to potent inhibitory activity was observed in all extracts. Ethanol and dichloromethane extracts were among the most potent when compared to water and petroleum ether extracts. The water extracts showed to be nontoxic on the Hek cell line with an IC50 value of 204.0, and 207.3 microg/ml (roots and bark) respectively. The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and ethanol extracts showed to be toxic on the Hek cell, with IC50 range from 5.94 to 42.91microg/ml. The results obtained indicate the effectiveness of these plants.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of the triterpene 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene on planktonic cells and biofilms from Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial effect of 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (CLF1), a triterpene isolated from Combretum leprosum Mart., in inhibiting the planktonic growth and biofilms of Gram positive bacteria Streptococcus mutans and S. mitis. The antimicrobial activity was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The antibiofilm potential was determined by quantifying total biomass and enumerating biofilm-entrapped viable bacteria. In addition, the acute toxicity of CLF1 on Artemia sp. nauplii was also determined. The results showed that CLF1 was able in inhibiting the growth of S. mutans and S. mitis with MIC and MBC of 7.8 mug/mL and 15.6 mug/mL, respectively. CLF1 was highly effective on biofilms of both bacteria. Only 7.8 mug/mL CLF1 was enough to inhibit by 97% and 90% biomass production of S. mutans and S. mitis, respectively. On the other hand, such effects were not evident on Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. The toxicity tests showed that the LC50 of CLF1 was 98.19 mug/mL. Therefore, CLF1 isolated from C. leprosum may constitute an important natural agent for the development of new therapies for caries and other infectious diseases caused by S. mutans and S. mitis.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against organisms isolated from respiratory tract infections in USA hospitals: results from the AWARE Program, 2009-2011.
AB  - The Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation Program monitors the  activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against pathogens causing either respiratory or skin and soft tissue infections. A total of 7733 isolates from patients in 80 medical centers across the United States (USA) identified as respiratory tract pathogens by the infection type and/or specimen site recorded by the submitting laboratory during 2009-2011 were evaluated. There were 3360 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1799 Haemophilus influenzae, 1087 Staphylococcus aureus, 678 Moraxella catarrhalis, 459 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 223 Escherichia coli, and 127 Klebsiella oxytoca. Annual penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae ranged from 21.9 to 24.3%. All S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at a ceftaroline MIC of </=0.5 mug/mL with 100.0% of isolates categorized as susceptible. Ceftaroline was 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone and 32-fold more active than amoxicillin-clavulanate against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Only 49.8% of the penicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. There were a total of 1087 S. aureus (48.9% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) isolates, and the yearly MRSA rate ranged from 47.9 to 49.7%. The ceftaroline MIC50/90 for S. aureus was at 0.25/1 mug/mL; 98.2% susceptible and no resistant strains (>/=4 mug/mL). Ceftaroline activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.25 mug/mL, respectively; 100% susceptible) was 2- to 4-fold greater than for MRSA (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/mL; 96.2% susceptible). The ceftriaxone MIC90 for MSSA was 4 mug/mL. Ceftaroline was active against H. influenzae (MIC50/90 </=0.015/0.03 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible) and against M. catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was active against non-extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype strains of Enterobacteriaceae but not against ESBL-positive phenotype strains. In summary, ceftaroline was highly active against a large collection of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in the USA during 2009 through 2011.
TI  - Secretion of a pneumococcal type II secretion system pilus correlates with DNA uptake during transformation.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that successfully adapts to the host environment via an efficient uptake system for free DNA liberated from other organisms in the upper respiratory tract, facilitating immune evasion and drug resistance. Although the initial signaling events leading to pneumococcal competence for DNA transformation and the fate of DNA when it has been taken up have been extensively studied, the actual mechanism by which DNA in the environment may traverse the thick capsular and cell wall layers remains unknown. Here we visualize that induction of competence results in the formation of a native morphologically distinct pilus structure on the bacterial surface. This plaited pilus is encoded by the competence (com)G locus, and, after assembly, it is rapidly released into the surrounding medium. Heterologous pneumococcal pilus expression in Escherichia coli was obtained by replacing the pulE-K putative pilin genes of the Klebsiella oxytoca type II secretion system with the complete comG locus. In the pneumococcus, the coordinated secretion of pili from the cells correlates to DNA transformation. A model for DNA transformation is proposed whereby pilus assembly "drills" a channel across the thick cell wall that becomes transiently open by secretion of the pilus, providing the entry port for exogenous DNA to gain access to DNA receptors associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Stent hypersensitivity and infection in sinus cavities.
AB  - Persistent mucosal inflammation, granulation tissue formation, hypersensitivity,  and multifactorial infection are newly described complications of retained drug-eluting stents from endoscopic sinus surgery for refractory rhinosinusitis. In an important report published in Allergy and Rhinology, a 45-year-old male patient suffering from recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery and was found, for the first time, to have steroid-eluting catheters that were inadvertently left in the ethmoid and frontal sinuses. The retained catheters had caused persistent mucosal inflammation and formation of granulation tissue denoting hypersensitivity reaction. These consequences had induced perpetuation of symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. Meticulous removal of the retained stents with the nitinol wings from inflamed tissues of the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoethmoidal recesses in which they were completely imbedded was successfully performed without polypoid regrowth. Cultures of specimens taken from both left and right stents showed heavy growth of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and moderate growth of Klebsiella oxytoca, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus anginosus. Fungal infection was not detected. The current knowledge and experience regarding stent hypersensitivity and infection in relation with the use of stents in sinus cavities is reviewed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Duodenal-mucosal bacteria associated with celiac disease in children.
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion  of cereal gluten proteins. This disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of CD. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of CD patients and control children. Duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, Wilkins-Chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, Casitone, and fatty acid agar. The isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active CD patients, followed by nonactive CD patients and control individuals. Members of the phylum Proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active CD than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum Firmicutes were less abundant. Members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae, particularly the species Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. In contrast, members of the family Streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active CD than in controls. Furthermore, isolates of the Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both CD patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. The findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.
TI  - [Vitreal surgery and etiological diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of vitreal surgery and the importance of etiological diagnosis in the treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: Retrospective series case study. 20 cases (20 eyes) of bacterial endophthalmitis that were treated in Peking Union Hospital were enrolled. 14 eyes were post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and 6 eyes were postoperative endophthalmitis. Twenty cases of aged 3 to 83 years [mean (40.5 +/- 23.9) years] were enrolled, including 12 male and 8 female patients. Pre-operative visual acuity: 2 cases were able to count fingers, 6 cases were able to perform hand movement, 11 cases had light perception, light projection were uncertain in all cases, and there was no light perception in 1 case. Hypopyon was seen in 13 eyes. Severe anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was seen in the other 7 eyes. The fundus could not be observed in all 20 eyes. B-Scan ultrasound examination indicated that all 20 eyes displayed moderate to severe vitreous opacity; proliferation and organization were apparent in 12 eyes, and retinal detachment in 2 eyes. Vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were performed in 18 eyes, and only intravitreal injection of antibiotics was administered in the other 2 eyes. At the beginning of operation, vitreous fluids were smeared and Gram stained. To eyes that showed a positive result in Gram staining, 1 mg of Vancomycin was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (balanced salt solution, BSS) in the eyes. To eyes that showed a negative result in Gram staining, 2 mg or 4 mg of Ceftazidime was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (BSS) in the eyes, respectively. Additionally, we examined the vitreous specimens and performed drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria cultured from the specimens. The antibiotics that the bacteria were susceptible to were chosen according to the drug sensitivity tests. The follow-up period is from 1 to 102 months (average 16.6 months). RESULTS: Thirteen eyes presented with a positive Gram staining result, and 3 eyes presented a negative result; the other 4 eyes were not infected. Bacteria were cultured in 15 eyes. The detection rate of pathogen was 75%. The result for 11 eyes was consistent with the smear results. The bacteria detected were Staphylococcus aureus in 3 eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 eyes, and Bacillus spp in 2 eyes. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Plesiomonas, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Loffi Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in 1 eye. The remaining 5 eyes did not have bacterial growth. The intraocular infection of all 20 eyes was controlled, and the intraocular inflammation was relieved. The visual acuity was significantly elevated. Postoperative visual acuity achieved were >/= 0.3 in 4 eyes, 0.1 to 0.2 in 4 eyes, 0.02 to 0.09 in 6 eyes, CF in 2 eyes, HM in 3 eyes and LP in 1 eye. The retinas of 17 eyes were normal, but recurrent retinal detachment occurred in the other 3 eyes, postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy combined with antibiotics and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were an effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. We obtained the vitreous fluid smears at the beginning of surgery to quickly and accurately obtain etiological diagnoses by Gram staining. It is crucial to use etiological diagnosis to choose the susceptible antibiotics.
TI  - High load of multi-drug resistant nosocomial neonatal pathogens carried by cockroaches in a neonatal intensive care unit at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches have been described as potential vectors for various pathogens for decades; although studies from neonatal intensive care units are scarce. This study assessed the vector potential of cockroaches (identified as Blatella germanica) in a neonatal intensive care unit setup in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 400 Blatella germanica roaches were aseptically collected for five consecutive months. Standard laboratory procedures were used to process the samples. RESULTS: From the external and gut homogenates, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter aeruginosa, Salmonella C1, Non Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Shigella flexneri were isolated. Multi-drug resistance was seen in all organisms. Resistance to up to all the 12 antimicrobials tested was observed in different pathogens. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches could play a vector role for nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit and environmental control measures of these vectors is required to reduce the risk of infection. A high level of drug resistance pattern of the isolated pathogens was demonstrated.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Complications of PORT-A-CATH(R) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (CVCs) in adult patients with moderate or severe SCD. AIMS: To review our experience with the use of the PORT-A-CATH((R)) device in sixteen patients with SCD undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. METHODS: Among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen SCD patients required the insertion of a PORT-A-CATH((R)) device. These patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- SD]. A total of 24 PORT-A-CATH((R)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. Eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. RESULTS: Out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. The organisms involved were Candida spp. (3), C. Parapsilosis (2), C. albicans (1), C. famata (1), C. lusitanice (1), Staphylococcus spp. (6), and S. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic Streptococcus (1), Diphtheroid bacilli (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Ps. Spp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella spp. (1), Serratia liquefaciens (1), Serratia fanticola (1), Achromobacter spp. (2) Chromobacterium violaceum (1), Delftia acidovirans (1), Stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), Alcaligenes faecalis (1), and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. One case presented with right atrial thrombosis/SVC syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. Two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. The median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). The rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [Pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that patients with SCD suffer infective complications associated with the PORT-A-CATH((R)), which often necessitate its removal. Although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of continuous (CI) and intermittent infusion (ITI) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. METHODS: Twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. Half of the patients received ertapenem as an ITI 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via CI over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. Blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24 h after terminating ITI or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting CI for each patient. After centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees C until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. RESULTS: Median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fCmax = 98.9 mg/L and fCmin = 2.5 mg/L for ITI, and fCss=15.9 mg/L for CI. The ITI and CI median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 L/h vs. 2.5 L/h and 15.4 L vs. 21.0 L, respectively. The ertapenem MIC ranges were as follows: Escherichia coli (0.006 to 0.5 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/L), Streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/L). ITI and CI provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the MIC for all bacteria. CONCLUSION: Ertapenem exhibited satisfactory PK/PD parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high MIC of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. CI administration resulted in equally effective PK/PD parameters as ITI in normal weight, good renal-function patients.
TI  - Assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  - Despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. One key component of better control of this disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. Mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. Development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial DNA extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples to complement traditional microbiological identification. Extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. The following species were identified: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Klebsiella spp. (including Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The detection procedure includes specific genomic DNA amplification by multiplex PCR for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. The specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. The extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. The analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/mL for milk samples spiked with Staph. aureus, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli, with a tendency for K. pneumoniae. The detection limit was 500 cfu/mL for Strep. uberis and Strep. agalactiae. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. When the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, DNA purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. Of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive Staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16S sequencing. The proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated PCR detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.
TI  - Prevalence and drug resistance in bacteria of the urinary tract infections in Bulawayo province, Zimbabwe.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain data on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria  isolated from patients with suspected urinary tract infection in Bulawayo province, Zimbabwe. METHOD: Over a period of one year, 257 urine samples were analyzed for bacteria by standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolated bacteria was done using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (40.3%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (16.1%), Klebsiella spp (11.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (8%), Group A Streptococcus (8%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (8%). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. It revealed a high resistance to ampicillin (84.5%) and cotrimoxazole (68.5%) among the Gram negative bacilli. Gram positive cocci showed resistance to Nalidixic acid (81%) and cotrimoxazole (69%). E. coli was susceptible to most of the drugs but 84% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, and 68% to cotrimoxazole. All isolates were sensitive to Nicene. CONCLUSION: The high levels of ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli and other enterobactericiae suggest the need to perform urinalysis and antibiotic susceptibility testing in all patients. Nicene should be considered as the first line therapy for all age groups. It is important for physicians to know susceptibility data for UTIs in order to optimize the use of empirical therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Bacterial growth kinetics in ACD-A apheresis platelets: comparison of plasma and  PAS III storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our objective was to determine the growth kinetics of bacteria in leukoreduced apheresis platelets (LR-AP) in a platelet (PLT) additive solution (PAS; InterSol, Fenwal, Inc.) compared to LR-AP stored in plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Hyperconcentrated, double-dose LR-AP were collected from healthy donors with a separator (AMICUS, Fenwal, Inc.). LR-AP were evenly divided, InterSol was added to half (65% InterSol:35% plasma [PAS]), and PLTs in autologous plasma were used for a paired control (PL). Bacteria were inoculated into each LR-AP PAS/PL pair (0.5-1.6 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL), and bacterial growth was followed for up to 7 days. Time to the end of the lag phase, doubling times, maximum concentration (conc-max), and time to maximum concentration (time-max) were estimated. RESULTS: Streptococcus viridans did not grow to detectable levels in either PAS or PL units. The other bacteria had no significant overall difference in the conc-max (p = 0.47) or time-max (p = 0.7) between PL and PAS LR-AP; PL had a 0.14 hours faster doubling rate (p = 0.023); and PAS had a 4.7 hours shorter lag time (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: We observed that five index organisms will grow in LR-AP stored in a 35%:65% ratio of plasma to InterSol where initial bacterial concentrations are 0.5 to 1.6 CFUs/mL. The more rapid initiation of log-phase growth for bacteria within a PAS storage environment resulted in a bacterial concentration up to 4 logs higher in the PAS units compared to the plasma units at 24 hours, but with no difference in the conc-max. This may present an early bacterial detection advantage for PAS-stored PLTs.
TI  - Klebsiella oxytoca-positive, penicillin-associated hemorrhagic enterocolitis in children.
AB  
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - A case of infliximab-induced psoriasis.
AB  - Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF-alpha) are a group of new drugs able to inhibit the action of this cytokine. Although systemic side effects have been well described, cutaneous adverse reactions have not yet been clearly elucidated. The authors report a case of a 29-year-old man affected by Crohn disease and ankylosing spondylitis who developed psoriatic lesions after IV infusion of infliximab 5 mg/Kg. The patient underwent cyclosporine treatment after interruption of biological therapy, and had complete resolution of cutaneous lesions. The reason for this phenomenon is not clear, Obviously more studies are necessary to define more clearly this paradoxical reaction. In addition, dermatologists must be informed about this potential cutaneous adverse event.
TI  - XLA-associated neutropenia treatment: a case report and review of the literature.
AB  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary B-cell deficiency syndrome with an incidence of 5 to 10 cases per million. The current treatment approach includes intravenous immunoglobulin and aggressive antibiotic regimens for infections. Besides recurrent infections, XLA patients may present with other manifestations, such as alopecia, enteropathy, amyloidosis, and neutropenia. Neutropenia, which has been shown in up to 25% of affected patients, might also contribute to the degree of severity of bacterial infections that have been reported in these cases. Here we present our experience with the granulocyte colony-stimulant factor, filgrastim (Neupogen), in the treatment of neutropenia in a 14-month-old child with XLA.
TI  - Developmental intestinal aerobic microflora in the kori bustard (Ardeotis kori).
AB  - A study was carried out to investigate the normal aerobic bacterial flora of developing kori bustard (Ardeotis kori) chicks, captive bred at the National Avian Research Center, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Faecal samples were collected from 14 birds at different ages from the first day of hatching until 99 days old and were cultured for aerobic bacteria. Several bacterial species were isolated from the cultures, they included Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridians, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus spp., Enterobacter, spp. and Serratia marcescens. Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from all but one of the faecal samples collected. They were also the predominant bacteria, accounting for between 55.6 and 73.4% of the mean colony count of faecal cultures from all age groups. E. coli was the most frequently isolated bacteria, the frequency and mean colony count increased as the birds grew older. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from between 50 and 100% of the faecal samples from all age groups, and they accounted for between 26.6 and 44.4% of the mean colony count. Results from this study indicated that Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci can be isolated frequently from the faeces of developing, clinically normal, captive bred kori bustard chicks.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of a high-rate hydrogen-producing microbial community in anaerobic agitated granular sludge bed bioreactors using glucose as substrate.
AB  - Fermentative H(2) production microbial structure in an agitated granular sludge bed bioreactor was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction-denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). This hydrogen-producing system was operated at four different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 h and with an influent glucose concentration of 20 g chemical oxygen demand/l. According to the PCR-DGGE analysis, bacterial community structures were mainly composed of Clostridium sp. (possibly Clostridium pasteurianum), Klebsiella oxytoca, and Streptococcus sp. Significant increase of Clostridium/total cell ratio (68%) was observed when the reactor was operated under higher influent flow rate. The existence of Streptococcus sp. in the reactor became more important when operated under a short HRT as indicated by the ratio of Streptococcus probe-positive cells to Clostridium probe-positive cells changing from 21% (HRT 4 h) to 38% (HRT 0.5 h). FISH images suggested that Streptococcus cells probably acted as seeds for self-flocculated granule formation. Furthermore, combining the inspections with hydrogen production under different HRTs and their corresponding FISH analysis indicated that K. oxytoca did not directly contribute to H(2) production but possibly played a role in consuming O(2) to create an anaerobic environment for the hydrogen-producing Clostridium.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Faecal coliform bacteria in Febros river (northwest Portugal): temporal variation, correlation with water parameters, and species identification.
AB  - Febros river water was sampled weekly, during 35 successive weeks, and analyzed for microbiological (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and enterococci) and chemical-physical (ammonia and temperature) parameters. All microbiological parameters were highly correlated with each other and with ammonia, suggesting that the simultaneous determination of all variables currently in use in the evaluation of the microbiological quality of waters is probably redundant, and could be simplified, and that ammonia should be tested as a sentinel parameter of the microbiological pollution load of Febros river. From the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms test (multiple tube fermentation technique) and retested in this assay, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were positive, indicating that the faecal coliforms test is not totally specific for Escherichia coli, and can detect other bacteria. Considering that these Klebsiella spp. are not necessarily of faecal origin, it was concluded that the faecal coliforms test can overestimate true faecal pollution. From the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms procedure, only Escherichia coli strains were clearly positive in the beta-D-glucuronidase test. All other species were negative or very weakly positive, suggesting that the assay of the beta-D-glucuronidase activity is less prone to false positives than the faecal coliforms test in the quantification of Escherichia coli in environmental waters.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - Microbial contamination of preservative free eye drops in multiple application containers.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The majority of eye drops used in the United Kingdom contain preservatives and are bottled in plastic containers. Preservative free drops are used to avoid ocular irritation and allergies in certain individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of microbial contamination of preservative free drops dispensed from multiusage containers. METHODS: Eye drop bottles were collected from patients attending the Tennent Institute of Ophthalmology outpatient and inpatient departments. The bottles were collected on day 3 (for inpatients) and day 7 (for outpatients) of use. The drops were inoculated onto different culture plates (chocolate agar, blood agar, fungal culture media, and enriched media) and the resulting microbial growth was identified using standard microbial identification techniques. RESULTS: 95 eye drop bottles were collected, containing a variety of 10 different eye drops. Significant bacterial growth was found in eight bottles. In total, seven different types of organism were identified from the eye drops. The organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus, Bacillus spp, Serattia spp, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and alpha streptococcus. Staph aureus was the commonest microbial organism. CONCLUSION: Preservative free eye drops in multiple application containers are at risk of contamination by potentially pathogenic micro-organisms.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - Detection of equine herpesvirus type 1 using a real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Equid herpesvirus 1 (EHV1) is a major disease of equids worldwide causing considerable losses to the horse industry. A variety of techniques, including PCR have been used to diagnose EHV1. Some of these PCRs were used in combination with other techniques such as restriction enzyme analysis (REA) or hybridisation, making them cumbersome for routine diagnostic testing and increasing the chances of cross-contamination. Furthermore, they involve the use of suspected carcinogens such as ethidium bromide and ultraviolet light. In this paper, we describe a real-time PCR, which uses minor groove-binding probe (MGB) technology for the diagnosis of EHV1. This technique does not require post-PCR manipulations thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination. Most importantly, the technique is specific; it was able to differentiate EHV1 from the closely related member of the Alphaherpesvirinae, equid herpesvirus 4 (EHV4). It was not reactive with common opportunistic pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter agglomerans often involved in abortion. Similarly, it did not react with equine pathogens such as Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Taylorella equigenitalis and Rhodococcus equi, which also cause abortion. The results obtained with this technique agreed with results from published PCR methods. The assay was sensitive enough to detect EHV1 sequences in paraffin-embedded tissues and clinical samples. When compared to virus isolation, the test was more sensitive. This test will be useful for the routine diagnosis of EHV1 based on its specificity, sensitivity, ease of performance and rapidity.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (CPFX) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [Bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. The sooner the diagnosis is established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. When the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. On the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. It is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. The AIM of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in the Paediatric Department of the Institute from January 1, 1978 to December 31, 2000. Patients originated from all parts of Yugoslavia. After the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. CSF was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. Diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by CSF culture; 2. elevation of CSF leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the Gram stain of CSF sediment. In 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Causes of meningitis were as follows: E. coli in 46 newborns (N) (26.5%), Streptococcus B haemolyticus group B in 35 N (20.2%), K. pneumoniae in 27 N (15.6%), K. oxytoca in 3 N (1.7%), Proteus spp in 14 N (8%), Salmonella spp in 12 N, Pseudomonas spp in 9 N, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 N, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 N, Enterobacter spp in 3 N, L. monocytogenes and Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus in 2 N each, and in one N. meningitidis, Streptococcus group D, Citrobacter, Morganella morganii and Alkaligenes xilosoxidans. Over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: E. coli (28.2%), SBHB (26.8%) and Klebsiella spp (11.3%). Over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: Klebsiella spp (26.8%), E. coli (19.2%), SBHB (14.1%), etc. In addition, new causes appeared, namely: Morganella morganii, Citrobacter, K. oxitoca and Alkaligenes xylosoxidans (Table 2). Of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died: of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (Table 1). Comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (Table 2). The explanation might be that the patients came to the Institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. The precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. Newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions where the intensive care units for newborns exist. CONCLUSION: The most frequent causes of meningitis are the following: E. coli, SBHB and Klebsiella pn. Frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. New uncommon causes have appeared. The mortality-rate remained very high.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Previous chemotherapy as a predictor of wound infections in nonmajor head and neck surgery: Results of a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this prospective study was to determine the incidence of  wound infections (WI) after clean uncontaminated head and neck cancer procedures and after emergency tracheotomies. METHODS: Two hundred twelve clean procedures without tracheotomy or opening of mucosa (neck dissections, large skin resections, thyroidectomies, parotid gland resections, and explorative cervicotomies) were studied at Oscar Lambret Cancer Center over a 24-month period. RESULTS: WI rate was 6.6% (14 of 212). In a univariate analysis, only one variable was significantly related to the likelihood of WI: previous anticancer chemotherapy. All but one patient who had had previous chemotherapy demonstrated WI (14 of 15). CONCLUSIONS: After previous chemotherapy, WI rate in clean uncontaminated head and neck surgery was as high as 90%. In this case, antibiotic prophylaxis should be evaluated.
TI  - Bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to December 1999 was performed. There were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. Three of the 5 isolates of S. aureus were resistant to methicillin. Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. Of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent antibiotic use, P. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (10%), K. pneumoniae (10%), Escherichia coli (10%), and E. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. Relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were the independent risk factors of bacteremia. There were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and Streptococcus mitis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in Korea.
AB  - Gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In Korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. In this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four Korean university hospitals during 1999-2000. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Gemifloxacin had the lowest MICs for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC90s of gemifloxacin for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, while those for other Gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/L. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against Gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in Korea.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of IV catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: 100 dogs. PROCEDURE: Catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. The distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. The saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. All bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. Most bacteria that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (Serratia odorifera, S. liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Acinobacter anitratus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp). Only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus spp). High percentages of organisms were resistant to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. Percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that IV catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - [Correlation of 55 samples of contact lens fluid and direct swabbings of the eye  surface of symptomatic wearers of contact lenses].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiological examination of contact lens storage solutions may reveal the etiological organisms responsible for keratitis and additionally harbour environmental contaminants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1998, conjunctival and corneal smears and scrapes, as well as the storage solutions of 55 soft contact lens wearers were examined microbiologically in a prospective non-randomised cohort study involving 53x unilateral and 2x bilateral cases of keraitis. RESULTS: In 42 of the in-use contact lens storage solutions, the following organisms were found: 8x Bacillus sp., 7x P. aeruginosa and 8x other pseudomonads, 6x Alcaligenes xylosans, 4x Serratia liquefaciens, 4x Enterobacter sp., 4x coagulase negative staphylococci, 3x Serratia marcescens, 3x S. aureus, 2x Streptococcus faecalis, 1x Klebsiella oxytoca and 5x Acanthameba. A significant correlation of ocular cultures was found for Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, S. aureus, S. faecalis and Acanthameba, but not for Bacillus, Alcaligenes, and coagulase negative staphylococci. Fungi were not found. The more pronounced the clinical picture, the more Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological examination of soft contact lens storage solutions of 55 keratitis patients confirmed that the microbes responsible were to be found in the fluid, in addition to environmental contaminants.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - In vitro model of infectious crystalline keratopathy: tissue architecture determines pattern of microbial spread.
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop an in vitro model of infectious crystalline keratopathy using human corneal buttons and to test the hypothesis that the compactness of the corneal stroma determines the pattern of microbial spread. METHODS: Twenty human corneal buttons obtained after penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus (KC) and eight human corneal buttons obtained from eye bank (EB) donor eyes were maintained in organ culture. Fourteen buttons (10 KC and 4 EB donors) were maintained in a turgid state (swollen, edematous) and 14 in a nonturgid state (compact, normal state of deturgescence) by the omission or addition of 5% dextran to the culture medium. Eight KC and four EB nonturgid buttons and eight KC and four EB turgid buttons were inoculated with Streptococcus viridans (Lancefield group G, gram-positive) organisms. Two KC nonturgid and two KC turgid buttons were inoculated with Klebsiella oxytoca (gram-negative) organisms. Bacterial migration and spread in the tissue were observed by light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Of the nonturgid buttons, six KC buttons and all four EB buttons inoculated with S. viridans and both KC buttons inoculated with K. oxytoca demonstrated an arborizing, crystallike pattern of bacterial spread. In the turgid buttons, five KC and all four EB buttons inoculated with S. viridans and both KC buttons inoculated with K. oxytoca demonstrated globular, amorphous colonies. This was in complete contrast to the needlelike branching appearance seen in nonturgid corneal buttons. Electron microscopy confirmed an interlamellar spread of the bacterial colonies. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in vitro model of bacterial keratitis. It demonstrates that the pattern of spread of bacteria within corneal tissue is largely determined by the compactness of the corneal stroma. Altering tissue architecture changed the pattern of bacterial migration and spread. This model has considerable potential in further understanding host-microbe interactions and microbial spread that occurs during infection.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by PCR and DGGE fingerprinting.
AB  - PURPOSE: Establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. METHODS: From 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and DNA was extracted. Fragments of 200 bp, spanning the V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rDNA, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). For phylogenetic identification, DGGE bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16S rDNA clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened by DGGE. Sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the EMBL database. Furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from conventional cultivation. RESULTS: 16S rDNA could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. Sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. The following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: Staphylococcus (n = 8), Corynebacterium (n = 7), Propionibacterium (n = 7), Streptococcus (n = 6), Bacillus (n = 2), Acinetobacter (n = 3), Pseudomonas (n = 3), Proteus (n = 1), and Brevundimonas (n = 1). Four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. They had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of Pantoea and Enterobacter (n = 1), Kingella and Neisseria (n = 1), Serratia and Aranicola (n = 1), and Leuconostoc and Weissella (n = 2), respectively. Culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), Corynebacteria (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Streptococcus sp. (n = 1), Proteus sp. (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). In total, 45% of the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were PCR positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. No sample positive by culture gave negative results by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: 16S rDNA sequence analyses and DGGE fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. Knowledge of their occurrence and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. We performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. OBJECTIVE: To delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. METHODS: Children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. Characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (TBSA), burn 15%]. Twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis, 6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13 involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia, 2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). Twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by CDC criteria no organism was recovered. Organisms causing infection were: Staphylococcus aureus, 19; Candida albicans, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 4; Enterococcus sp., 3; Escherichia coli, 1; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and Candida parapsilosis, 1. Burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (TBSA >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors for infection; young age and site of burn were not. CONCLUSION: The most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. Characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. Children with flame and inhalation injury, TBSA burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  - An optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, Clostridium bifermentans and C. sordellii, and Prevotella bivia. Serial electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. Four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. Thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. The analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. The method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of S. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. Since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Efficacy of oral ciprofloxacin as selective intestinal decontaminant in cirrhosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selective intestinal decontamination has been proposed to prevent bacterial infection in cirrhosis. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of ciprofloxacin as selective intestinal decontaminant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative microbiological studies on serial faeces were carried out in 15 cirrhotic patients. Ciprofloxacin was given orally at the starting dose of 250 mg every 12 hours for 7 days followed by a single dose of 250 mg/day from day 7 to day 14 and 125 mg/day for the next 3 weeks. Total stool samples were examined in basal conditions and on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 of treatment and 3 and 7 days after treatment withdrawal. RESULTS: Gram-negative flora was completely eliminated in all patients by ciprofloxacin given at doses of 500 and 250 mg/day. When the drug was tapered to 125 mg/day, Escherichia coli reappeared in stools of 7 patients (antibiotic-resistant in one patient) and Klebsiella oxytoca in two patients (antibiotic-resistant in one patient). Faecal concentration of Group D Streptococcus was significantly increased at the end of therapy (basal mean 7.7 +/- 1.2 log CFU vs post treatment mean 9.6 +/- 0.5 log CFU, p < 0.05) while the faecal concentration of anaerobic flora and Candida albicans showed no change. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of oral ciprofloxacin as a selective intestinal decontaminant and ciprofloxacin 250 mg/day is the recommended dose for maintaining Selective Intestinal Decontamination. However, the risks of inducing antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative flora and promoting overgrowth of Gram-positive flora must be carefully considered in all patients chronically treated with oral quinolones.
TI  - Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (H17B) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. METHOD: H17B and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (H21B)) were assayed by HPLC. RESULTS: In the absence of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. In the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that H17B degradation was not modified by cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae). Three bacilli increased degradation, Escherichia coli 59.1 +/- 19.4%, Klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0 +/- 17.9%. CONCLUSION: The degradation of H17B into hydrortisone and H21B may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - Origin and identification of bacteria which produce kairomones in the frass of Acrolepiopsis assectella (Lep., Hyponomeutoidea).
AB  - The volatiles used by the parasitoid Diadromus pulchellus to find its host, the leek moth, are produced by the bacteria developing in the frass of the host larvae. The origin and the nature of these bacteria were investigated. Samples were taken from healthy leeks and from infested leeks in the field, as well as from the frass of larvae reared in the laboratory either on the host plant or on an artificial diet. The various species of bacteria identified were cultured in the presence of precursors of leek sulphur volatiles and their volatile emissions were analysed. Klebsiella oxytoca and various Bacillus, common decomposers of plant matter, were the principal species producing active volatiles which were alkyl disulphides.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Suture abscesses after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Eighteen suture abscesses that developed after penetrating keratoplasty in 15 patients were reviewed. The time from keratoplasty to the diagnosis of an abscess ranged from 1 to 53 months with a mean of 21.5 months. In 13 of the 18 cases, the patient was taking topical steroids at the time of diagnosis. All were culture-proven bacterial ulcers, except for one case that had a positive Gram's stain, but no growth on culture. The organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidemidis (six eyes), Streptococcus pneumoniae (five eyes), Sta. aureus (four eyes), Str. viridans (two eyes), Klebsiella oxytoca (one eye), Serratia marcescens (one eye), Moraxella sp (one eye), and Escherichia coli (one eye). The offending suture was removed in all cases, and the eyes were treated with topical fortified antibiotics (cefazolin and tobramycin). After treatment, 67% (12 of 18 eyes) had clear grafts, 17% (three of 18 eyes) were scarred, and 16% (three of 19 eyes) had failed grafts. Intensive topical steroid therapy was used when a subsequent graft rejection developed. Retained sutures following corneal transplants can result in sight-threatening infections and should be considered for removal as soon as the wound is well healed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - Synergy and cumulated killing effect of the penems FCE 22101 and FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin against bacteria isolated from septicaemia.
AB  - Blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella oxytoca were tested for their synergistic and cumulated killing effect (CKE) with the new penems FCE 22101 or FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin. The tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study the CKE in vivo after antibiotic treatment of the bacteria in vitro. Synergy was observed within two to seven h with all isolates in early logarithmic phase, except with S. aureus, which was rapidly killed by the penems alone. After one h treatment with the antibiotic combinations in vitro, a CKE was demonstrated for up to six h both in vitro and in vivo. The magnitude of the CKE differed between strains and in vitro vs. in vivo.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - Subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the Dominican Republic.
AB  - A study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Paper point sampling, transport in VMGA III, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. Direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. Nonselective culturing showed Gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. Fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and Peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. Enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. Enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, Klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in 10 patients. Parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the USA. In conclusion, fewer spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in Santo Domingo patients compared to those in USA. High levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in Santo Domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Is candidiasis the true cause of vulvovaginal irritation in women with diabetes mellitus?
AB  - Vulvovaginitis is common in diabetic women and is often treated with antifungal agents on the assumption that the causative organism is Candida albicans. In a survey of 100 consecutive diabetic women attending a diabetes clinic 36 had complained to their general practitioner about vulvovaginal irritation during the past three years and 26 were treated with antifungal agents without a vaginal examination or swabs being taken. In a separate study 27 post-menopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes and symptoms of vulvovaginitis were investigated. The organisms cultured were: Candida albicans (n = 6), beta haemolytic streptococci (n = 14), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus milleri (n = 1), Streptococcus faecalis (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), no organisms (n = 3). Where a bacterial organism was isolated symptoms resolved in all but one case with appropriate antibiotic treatment. It is recommended that the practice of initiating antifungal treatment without taking high vaginal swabs should be reviewed and treatment should be given specifically rather than empirically.
TI  - [Clinical examination of ceftibuten in acute bronchitis].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of ceftibuten (CETB, 7432-S) was performed in 20 patients with acute bronchitis. They were consisted of 10 males and 10 females aged from 20 to 80 years old. CETB was given orally in daily dose of 300 mg (18 cases) or 600 mg (2 cases) in three divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 to 14 days. Especially they were given for 7 days in 16 cases. A total of 11 strains comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of beta-Streptococcus and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii were identified from sputa before administration. All of the above bacteria were eradicated but, in 1 case, a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes appeared after the treatment (eradication ratio = 100%). The clinical efficacy rate was 100%: Responses were excellent in 3 cases and good in 17 cases. There was no side effect and no abnormal changes in laboratory test results. From the avobe results, it is concluded that CETB is effective, safe and useful new oral cephem on acute bronchitis.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanate in severe infections in patients with varying renal function.
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy of ticarcillin/clavulanate was assessed in 71 patients with severe infections: 38 acute pyelonephritis, 16 septicaemia and 19 miscellaneous infections. The patients were classified according to their renal function in: Group A, normal (16 cases); B, mild renal impairment (RI) with creatinine clearance (Clcr) between 80 and 40 ml/min (18 cases); C, moderate RI with Clcr between 40 and 15 ml/min (12 cases); D, severe RI with (Clcr) between 15 and 5 ml/min (13 cases) and E, terminal with (Clcr) less than 5 ml/min (12 cases). A total of 105 microorganisms (48.6% resistant to ticarcillin): 31 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 Escherichia coli, 21 other Enterobacteriaceae, 2 Haemophilus influenzae, 10 Bacteroides spp., 14 enterococci, 8 staphylococci and 1 streptococcus, were isolated. All except six Ps. aeruginosa were sensitive to ticarcillin/clavulanate, using 75:10 microgram discs. Bacteriological eradication was obtained in 97% of the cases on the third day and at the end of treatment, and in 82% of the cases after one month. In all the assessable cases, the clinical symptoms disappeared on the third day except in one patient who developed a resistant strain (Klebsiella oxytoca). The wide range of bacteria assessed and the clinical-bacteriological success rates demonstrated that the ticarcillin/clavulanate combination had an efficacy/safety profile that could be considered excellent. Tolerance was good and side effects were not observed. This study confirms the practical efficacy of the recommended dosages derived from our previous kinetic studies in RI.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, SM-7338.
AB  - SM-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at MICs of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. It was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. SM-7338 inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates MICs were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. Group A, B, and C streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. There was no major inoculum size effect, and the MBCs were within a dilution of the MICs. SM-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid pH under anaerobic conditions. Plasmid beta-lactamases of TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, SHV-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, PSE-3, OXA-2, OXA-3, OXA-4, OXA-5, and OXA-7; Staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases P-99 and K-1; Morganella species; and Proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze SM-7338. The repeated transfer of organisms increased the MICs of SM-7338, as it did the MICs of imipenem.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S 6472 granule preparation (sustained-release cefaclor) in chronic bronchitis].
AB  - S 6472 granule preparation, a sustained-release cefaclor, was orally administered to 20 acutely exacerbated cases of chronic bronchitis at a daily dosage of 750 mg (titer) in 2 divided doses for a duration of 7-15 days and its clinical usefulness was evaluated. Clinical efficacies were good in 17 cases and fair in 3 cases, with a rate of efficacy of 85.0%. Organisms isolated from 13 patients were totalling 14 strains, i.e., 5 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 2 strains of Streptococcus sp., 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 strain of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus. All these strains, except the strains of Streptococcus sp., disappeared upon the administration of the drug. With regard to the safety, no side effects nor abnormal laboratory test values were encountered.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological evaluation of cefmenoxime in the newborn infant].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) has been administered under parenteral injection to 39 neonates delivered at term, nearly always by monotherapy in an average dosage of 86.8 mg/kg/day. CMX has been used 31 times in first line therapy and 8 times after failure of association Ampicillin-Gentamicin. 25 strains have been identified: 16 E. coli (9 Ampicillin resistant), 7 P. mirabilis (1 Ampicillin resistant), 1 K. oxytoca and 1 Streptococcus B. The neonates group with septicaemia (1 with arthritis) has been cured without after-effects as urinary tract infections and systemic infections. 2 respiratory tract infections have been improved, the others have been cured. Bacterial samples have always been sterilized within 2 days. Local tolerance (IV or/and IM injection) has been very good. No clinical or biological abnormality has been imputed to treatment. Cefmenoxime appears very effective on enterobacteriaceae (MIC range 0.05-0.5 mg/l) and can be used in newborn infections.
TI  - Bacterial interference by anaerobic species isolated from human feces.
AB  - Eighty-four anaerobic fecal isolates obtained from five healthy volunteers were tested for their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of eight species of Enterobacteriaceae, four species of faculative gram-positive cocci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Forty-nine of the 84 anaerobic isolates (58%) inhibited the growth of at least one indicator bacterium. Isolates of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp. were most consistently inhibitory. Anaerobic cocci and clostridia were infrequently inhibitory; eubacteria showed no inhibitory activity. Serratia marcescens was the indicator most often inhibited; 54% of all anaerobic isolates tested, all of nine Bifidobacterium isolates and 33 of 43 Bacteroides isolates inhibited this organism. No anaerobes inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - [Piperacillin in the newborn infant. A clinical and pharmacologic study].
AB  - The study involved 70 neonates born at 27 to 48 weeks of pregnancy (mean: 34.2 weeks) and weighing between 840 and 4350 g (mean: 1860 g). In every case piperacillin was combined with an aminoglycoside. The infants were treated for materno-foetal infection (14), post-partum infection (19), enterocolitis (18, surgical in 9 cases) and other post-operative infections (19). The antibiotic combination was given prophylactically in 2 cases. Fifty micro-organisms were isolated in 39 patients: 24 from blood (hemoculture), 2 from CSF, 24 from multiple peripheral samples. There were 13 Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus B, D, A, Listeria spp.) and 37 Gram-negative organisms (E. coli 14, Klebsiella spp. 10, Enterobacter spp. 6). Clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained in 67 patients. Three failures were recorded, with resistance to treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae and emergence (at hemoculture) of Klebsiella oxytoca under treatment in one patient and of Enterobacter cloacae in another patient. A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 47 neonates. Piperacillin (75 mg/kg per dose) was given twice a day until the 8th day post-partum and three times a day subsequently. The antibiotic was administered either by 30-min infusions or by intravenous or intramuscular injections; 124 serum level measurements were carried out at peak and/or residual level. In 44 infants with normal renal and hepatic function the mean residual level was 23 micrograms/ml (range: 7-100 micrograms/ml) and the mean peak level was 119 micrograms/ml (range: 47-278 micrograms/ml). No local or systemic side-effect was noted, and there was no evidence of toxicity.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  - Cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. Although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against Pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men, 6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. Both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. Concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. The mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. At eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. The total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. Ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. Up to ten hours, the SBA of ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. At one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a SBA of 1:4 for Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With the addition of netilmicin, median SBA against Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. Netilmicin enhanced the SBA of ceftazidime. The combination was not effective against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin and seven other antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was tested against 469 clinical isolates derived mainly from urinary samples from outpatients. It inhibited all Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus strains at a concentration of 0.25 micrograms/ml, and all Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains at a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml or less. Norfloxacin proved to be more effective than nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin against all gram-negative rods tested.
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperzone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out  in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. Peak MIC of T-1982 against S. pyogenes (group A) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. Peak MICs of T-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against B. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against K. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. Serum levels and urinary excretions of T-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. When given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of T-1982 attained the peak level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (T 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. Approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form into urine within 6 hours. 4. Twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with T-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by Serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant E. coli. The efficacy rate was 96.3%. In this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes) and Gram-negative rods (H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae P. vulgaris, B. pertussis, S. marcescens, E. coli) were eradicated by the treatment with T-1982. 6. No noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of GOT in 1 case.
