TI  == polyunsaturated fatty acids modify expression of tgf-beta in a co-culture model ultilising human colorectal cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to , and
AB  == commensal bacteria and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) have both been shown independently to modulate immune responses. this study tested the hypothesis that the different colonic immunomodulatory responses to commensal (lactobacillus gasseri) and pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) may be modified by pufas. experiments used a transwell system combining the colorectal cell line ht29, or its mucous secreting sub-clone ht29-mtx, with peripheral blood mononuclear cells to analyse immunomodulatory signalling in response to bacteria, with and without prior treatment with arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid. l. gasseri increased transforming  growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1) mrna and protein secretion in colonic cell lines  when compared with controls, an effect that was enhanced by pre-treatment with eicosapentaenoic acid. in contrast, the gram-negative pathogen e. coli lf82 had no significant effect on tgf-beta1 protein. l. gasseri also increased il-8 mrna but not protein while e. coli increased both; although differences between pufa treatments were detected, none were significantly different to controls. colonic  epithelial cells show different immunomodulatory signalling patterns in response  to the commensal l. gasseri compared to e. coli and s. aureus and pre-treatment of these cells with pufas can modify responses. practical applications: we have demonstrated an interaction between dietary pufas and epithelial cell response to both commensal and pathogenic bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract by utilising in vitro co-culture models. the data suggest that n-3 pufas may provide some protection against the potentially damaging effects of pathogens. furthermore, the beneficial effects of combining n-3 pufas and the commensal bacteria, and potential probiotic, l. gasseri are illustrated by the increased expression of immunoregulatory tgf-beta1.

TI  == purified cell wall from the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus gasseri activates systemic inflammation and, at higher doses, produces lethality in a rat model.
AB  == introduction: one proposed benefit of probiotic therapy is that probiotic bacterial cell-wall binding to intestinal cell pathogen-recognition receptors activates protective innate immunity. however, in critically ill patients, intestinal epithelium disruption by shock or other insults may compromise this compartmentalized response and cause systemic bacteria and cell-wall translocation. the effects of intravascular introduction of probiotic bacterial cell wall are unclear. methods: we investigated 24-hour infusions of purified cell wall from lactobacillus gasseri atc33323 (l. gasseri), a probiotic bacterium, in sprague-dawley rats (n = 49). results: increasing cell-wall doses (0 (control), 10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg over 24 hours) produced dose-ordered decreases in survival measured after 168 hours (11 survivors/11 total (100%), seven of seven (100%), seven of seven (100%), six of eight (75%), five of eight (63%), and one of nine (11%), respectively, p < 0.0001). the l. gasseri cell wall was equally or more lethal than staphylococcus aureus cell wall, which was previously studied (100% to 88% survival with the same increasing doses). during  challenge, compared with controls, l. gasseri cell wall produced increases in blood il-1beta, il-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, migratory inhibitory protein-1alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and nitric oxide, and decreases in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets that were greater with higher versus lower doses (p </= 0.05). medium-dose cell wall (40 and 80 mg/kg combined) progressively decreased blood pressure and increased heart rate, and all doses increased lactate, hepatic transaminases, and creatinine phosphokinase (p </= 0.05). conclusion: although l. gasseri, like other probiotic bacteria, is considered safe, its cell wall can stimulate the maladaptive inflammatory response associated with pathogenic bacteria. such effects deserve study, especially regarding critically ill patients.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  == lactobacillus spp., referred to as ij-1 and ij-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. according to the analyses of 16s rdna sequence, lactobacillus sp. ij-1 showed greater than 99% homology with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t), and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 had  greater than 99% homology with the l. gasseri atcc 33323(t) and l. johnsonii atcc 33200(t). the ph changes in the culture media of lactobacillus sp. ij-1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. both strains inhibited the growth of  pathogenic microorganisms, such as listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, salmonella  enterica kctc 12401, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus kctc 3881, and bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.

TI  == cd1d-dependent regulation of bacterial colonization in the intestine of mice.
AB  == the accumulation of certain species of bacteria in the intestine is involved in both tissue homeostasis and immune-mediated pathologies. the host mechanisms involved in controlling intestinal colonization with commensal bacteria are poorly understood. we observed that under specific pathogen-free or germ-free conditions, intragastric administration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, or lactobacillus gasseri resulted in increased colonization of the small intestine and bacterial translocation in mice lacking cd1d, an mhc class i-like molecule, compared with wt mice. in contrast, activation of cd1d-restricted t cells (nkt cells) with alpha-galactosylceramide caused diminished intestinal colonization with the same bacterial strains. we also found prominent differences in the composition of intestinal microbiota, including increased adherent bacteria, in cd1d-/- mice in comparison to wt mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. germ-free cd1d-/- mice exhibited a defect in paneth cell granule ultrastructure and ability to degranulate after bacterial colonization. in vitro, nkt cells were shown to induce the release of lysozyme from intestinal crypts. together, these data support a role for cd1d in  regulating intestinal colonization through mechanisms that include the control of paneth cell function.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
AB  == in the search for new probiotics, 61 lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at ph 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing mrs broth. intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but  atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. two lactobacillus gasseri and 2 lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. they also adhered to human caco-2 and ht-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == some probiotic properties of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == lactobacilli have long been considered to be protective flora in the vagina. in this study, samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women, and 58 strains of lactobacillus spp. were isolated from 10 of these women. the identification results revealed that lactobacillus gasseri was the predominant lactobacilli in healthy women. the amounts of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) produced by lactobacillus spp. were determined. the vaginal ph levels  induced by lactobacillus spp. strains ranged from 1.00 to 2.15. the titratable acidity of the strains ranged from 0.27 to 1.33%. the h(2)o(2) concentration produced in the lactobacilli strains ranged between 1.01 microg/ml and 15.50 microg/ml. the antimicrobial effects of the lactobacilli against the pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli atcc 11230, staphylococcus aureus atcc 2392, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 29212 and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis rskk 171 were also determined by the agar diffusion methods.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of four lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk.
AB  == aims: the antimicrobial potential of four lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius  cect5713, lactobacillus gasseri cect5714, l. gasseri cect5715 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716), isolated from fresh human breast milk, was evaluated in this study and compared with lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711, a reuterin-producing strain isolated from an artisan goat's cheese. methods and results: agar diffusion tests, competitive adhesion assays and mucin expression assays were carried out in order to value the antibacterial properties of the lactobacilli strains. the antibacterial capability of the strains was tested in vivo by using  a murine infection model with salmonella choleraesuis. the results revealed that  all the strains studied, displayed antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria. however, the antibacterial potential varied among the lactobacilli tested and, in fact, l. salivarius cect5713 showed not only the best in vitro antibacterial activity, but also the highest protective effect against a salmonella strain in the murine infection model. conclusion: the four breast-milk lactobacilli, and particularly l. salivarius cect5713, possess potent antibacterial activities that result in a higher protection against s. choleraesuis cect4155 in a mouse infection model. significance and impact of the  study: these results suggest that lactobacilli from breast milk could contribute  to an anti-infective protection in neonates and would be excellent candidates for the development of infant probiotic products.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by h2o2-producing lactobacillus gasseri isolated from the vaginal tract of cattle.
AB  == infectious diseases are the major reproductive complication during postpartum. the bacteria that colonize the postpartum uterus of cattle are specific as well as opportunistic pathogens that include staphylococcus aureus. the antibiotics and antiseptic agents used in the treatment of postpartum acute infections induce residues in foods, spread of bacterial resistance, increase in financial costs and failures in defense mechanisms of the host. preventive treatment with probiotic products could decrease the use of antibiotics in dairy farming systems. lactobacilli are present in the vaginal microflora of healthy cows. they can prevent pathogen colonization by mechanisms such as the production of antagonistic substances as lactic acid, h2o2, or bacteriocins. the aim of the present study was the selection of h2o2 generating lactobacilli from a group of 72 strains isolated from the vagina of cattle. both lactobacillus gasseri crl1421 and lactobacillus gasseri crl1412, which share some probiotic properties, produce h2o2, detected by the plate colorimetric method. they were chosen to study the kinetics of h2o2 production under different culture conditions. both microorganisms produced greater amounts of h2o2 in aerated than in static cultures. as l. gasseri crl1421 had a greater capacity to generate h2o2, associative cultures with this strain and s. aureus were conducted. a significant decrease in the growth of the pathogen was detected after culture for 6h, this effect being greater under aerated conditions. the addition of catalase to mixed  cultures partially abolished the inhibition, an effect that could be attributed to the combined action of h2o2 and other antagonistic metabolites. the simultaneous addition of catalase and naoh to these cultures restored s. aureus growth. this observation suggests that the inhibition was produced by the combination of h2o2 and lactic acid, both released by the lactobacilli. electron  microphotographs showed the damage caused by the lactobacilli supernatant on the  pathogenic cells. the treatment of s. aureus with lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide evidenced that each metabolite produced a different type of morphological damage. the number of viable cells obtained agrees with the electron microscopy observations. the results support the idea that l. gasseri crl1421 could be successfully included in a probiotic product to prevent s. aureus infection in cows.

TI  == genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  == beta-glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from ruminococcus gnavus e1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. the complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp dna fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from r. gnavus e1 was determined. five orfs were detected on this fragment: three complete orfs (orf2, gus and orf3) and two partial orfs (orf4 and orf5). the products of orf2 and orf3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (ptss), such as escherichia coli bglc,  bacillus subtilis bglp and bacillus halodurans pts enzyme ii. the product of orf5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bgla). the gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of lactobacillus gasseri (69%), e. coli (61%), clostridium perfringens (59%) and staphylococcus aureus (58%). by complementing an e. coli strain in which the uida gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the r. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes orf2, orf3 and orf5.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic studies on the localization of peptidoglycan peptide subunit pentapeptides in bacterial cell walls.
AB  == the peptide subunit pentapeptide h-l-ala-d-glu(l-lys-d-ala-d-ala-oh)-nh2 of peptidoglycan was localized in the cell walls of several gram-positive bacteria employing the indirect immunoferritin technique. specific antibodies to the d-alanyl-d-alanine moiety of non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptide were raised in rabbits by immunization with synthetic immunogen albumin-(ch2co-gly-l-ala-l-ala-d-ala-d-ala-oh)39. specificity of these antibodies for the peptide subunit pentapeptide and not for the peptide subunit tetrapeptide was corroborated in a farr-type radio-active hapten binding assay. specificity of labelling with ferritin was established by immunoelectron microscopic controls, and by the excellent correlation between specific labelling of cells with ferritin and the particular peptidoglycan primary structure of bacterial strains  investigated. cells of lactobacillus gasseri, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus revealing non-crosslinked peptide subunit pentapeptides in  their peptidoglycans could specifically be labelled. lactobacillus acidophilus and bacillus subtilis, on the contrary, missing such pentapeptides, failed in labelling. the implication of this method to possibly localize the points of attack of penicillin or cycloserine is discussed.
