TI  == [clinical and bacteriological features of six cases with intracranial abscess in  childhood].
AB  == from october 1988 to march 2001, 5 patients with 6 episodes of intracranial abscesses were admitted to chiba-children's hospital. average age when they were  admitted was 10 years and 1 month. initial clinical symptoms were fever in 5 cases, and headache in 1 case. it took 21 days from the appearance of the initial symptoms to diagnose the intracranial abscess. four out of 5 patients had underlying diseases that were prone to cause intracranial abscess. two patients of these were cyanotic congenital heart diseases (tetralogy of fallot and asplenic heart), and the other 2 were sinusitis. computed tomography revealed that brain abscess was found in 5 cases, and subdural empyema in 1 case. there were 3 single and multiple abscesses each. the most common lesion was the temporal lobe. eight bacterial strains were isolated from 5 cases. five were streptococci (3 were streptococcus milleri group, other 2 were streptococcus oralis and microaerophilic streptococcus) and 3 were anaerobes (prevotella loescheii, prevotella bivia and fusobacterium nucleatum). antimicrobial therapy was started with panipenem-betamiprone in 3 cases, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin in the other cases resre ctinely. duration of therapy ranged from 28 to 67 days (45 days, average). in 5 cases, drainage with craniotomy was performed in addition to antimicrobial therapy. one case was treated medically alone, but this was the only case with recurrence after 1 year  2 months. there were no serious complications such as intraventricular rupture of abscess. all patients had good outcomes, but mild neurological sequela was found  in 1 case.
