TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of athrixia phylicoides dc. (bush tea), monsonia burkeana (special tea) and synergistic effects of both combined herbal teas.
AB  == objective: to determine the chemical compositions and evaluate the antimicrobial  activity of bush tea (athrixia phylicoides dc.), special tea (monsonia burkeana)  and synergy (combination of bush tea and special tea). methods: total polyphenols were determined using the methods reported by singleton and rossi (1965) and modified by waterman and mole (1994). tannins were determined using vanillin hcl  methods described by prince et al. (1978). total antioxidants were determined using the methods described by awika et al. (2004). the micro dilution technique  using 96-well micro-plates, as described by eloff (1998) was used to obtain the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) and minimum microbicidal concentration (mmc) values of the ethanol extracts against the microorganisms under study. the  microbes strain used was gram negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumonia; gram positive bacteria such as bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus and a fungus candida albicans. results: the results demonstrated that special tea contains significantly higher content of total polyphenols (8.34 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.83 mg/100 g) as compared to  bush tea [total polyphenols (6.41 mg/100g) and total antioxidant (0.63 mg/100g)]  and combination of bush tea and special tea [total polyphenols (6.42 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.64 mg/100 g)]. there was no significant difference in tannins between bush tea, special tea and synergy. the results of antimicrobial activity (mic and mmc) demonstrated that the ethanol extracts of bush tea, special tea and synergy possessed antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms at different zones. the mic of bush tea ranged from 1.56 to 12.50  mg/ml while the mmc ranged from 0.78 to 12.50 mg/ml. special tea's mic ranged from 0.39 to 12.50 mg/ml while the mmc ranged from 0.01 to 12.50 mg/ml. the mic of synergy ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/ml while the mmc ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/ml without positive synergistic effect recorded. conclusions: both bush  and special tea contain total polyphenols, total antioxidants and tannins with special tea containing a significantly higher total polyphenols and total antioxidant as compared to bush tea and synergy. bush tea, special tea and synergy possess antimicrobial activity at various degrees.

TI  == evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  == background: despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (plts) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. we evaluated the bactx assay (immunetics, inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. study design and methods: apheresis- and whole blood-derived plt units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools,  inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the bactx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. specificity on sterile plts and reproducibility across different plt units and assay kit lots was also determined. results: analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. in time-to-detection studies after inoculation of plts with 0.7 to 5.3 cfus/ml, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were  above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 plt units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. conclusions: the bactx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) cfus/ml threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. these findings suggest that the bactx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in plt units and pools near time of use.

TI  == [analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  == the selective culture method and pcr-dgge technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system  constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. the results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. the upgma cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season  were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. five different sequences (df1-df5) were obtained through blast analysis and retrieval. the closest known origin groups were located as escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., proteus sp., klebsiella oxytoca, and burkholderia sp. respectively. the blastx comparison test showed that df1 closely related to the activities of the mycobacterium bacillus and the bacillus amyloliquefaciens, df2 functioned as a conservative potential atp binding protein, df3 related to the activities of the  bacillus cereus spore, df4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and df5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.

TI  == application of the bactericidal activity of epsilon-poly-l-lysine to the storage  of human platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: epsilon-poly-l-lysine (epsilon-pll) is a polypeptide comprising approximately 30 l-lysine subunits generated by bond formation between alpha-carboxy and epsilon-amino groups. it is an approved antimicrobial food preservative in japan. however, the efficacy of epsilon-pll as an antibacterial additive for storage of human platelet concentrates (pcs) is not known. study design and methods: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and klebsiella oxytoca (20 colony-forming units/ml) were inoculated into 100% plasma pcs or pcs  containing 80% platelet (plt) additive solution with 5.0 mmol/l potassium and 1.5 mmol/l magnesium (pas-iiim) and 20% plasma (pas-iiim pcs). next, a range of epsilon-pll concentrations up to 200 and 50 microg/ml were added to plasma pcs and pas-iiim pcs, respectively, and the bacterial count was determined on days 1, 2, 5, and 8. the quality of the pcs was also determined. results: bacterial growth was inhibited at epsilon-pll concentrations of 200 and 50 microg/ml in the plasma and pas-iiim pcs after 8 days of incubation. the percentage of cd62p-positive plts was higher in plasma pcs treated with 200 microg/ml epsilon-pll and in pas-iiim pcs treated with 50 microg/ml epsilon-pll than in the respective controls without epsilon-pll. there were no remarkable differences in  the other variables, that is, plt number, mean plt volume, ph, aggregability, percentage of pac-1-positive cells, lactate dehydrogenase release, and plasma k and na concentrations between the epsilon-pll-treated pcs and the controls. conclusions: epsilon-pll inhibited the growth of bacteria in the pcs and did not  considerably affect the quality of pcs, except cd62p expression. further studies  are required to estimate the in vivo effectiveness and safety of epsilon-pll-treated pcs.

TI  == characterization of corrosive bacterial consortia isolated from petroleum-product-transporting pipelines.
AB  == microbiologically influenced corrosion is a problem commonly encountered in facilities in the oil and gas industries. the present study describes bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines located in the northwest and southwest region in india, using traditional cultivation technique  and 16s rdna gene sequencing. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequences of the  isolates was carried out, and the samples obtained from the diesel and naphtha-transporting pipelines showed the occurrence of 11 bacterial species namely serratia marcescens ace2, bacillus subtilis ar12, bacillus cereus ace4, pseudomonas aeruginosa ai1, klebsiella oxytoca acp, pseudomonas stutzeri ap2, bacillus litoralis an1, bacillus sp., bacillus pumilus ar2, bacillus carboniphilus ar3, and bacillus megaterium ar4. sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from both pipelines. the dominant bacterial species identified in the petroleum pipeline samples were b. cereus and s. marcescens in  the diesel and naphtha pipelines, respectively. therefore, several types of bacteria may be involved in biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in industrial facilities. in addition, localized (pitting) corrosion of the pipeline steel in the presence of the consortia was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. the potential role of each species in biofilm formation and steel corrosion is discussed.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  == infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (aa). there  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with aa and the  patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in  the infections that they incur. prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk  factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. the most common invasive mycoses include the aspergillus species, zygomycetes, candida spp., and fusarium spp. bacterial infections that are seen in patients with aa include gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterococcus, staphylococus aureus, clostridium spp., micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, salmonella, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumonia, aeromonas hydrophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio vulnificus. viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides a, b, and c. evidence of the parasite strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. this review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with aa who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. the specific  immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 in fermented crop straw. methods: total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis. all these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of sfc-2. results: (1) phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16s rdna gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacterfreundii, klebsiella terrigena and citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of sfc-2 cell-free  culture supernatant. the results showed that: sfc-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from sfc-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from  the culture of sfc-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease k.

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  == background: an automated bacterial culture system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. the recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella  oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens,  streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 cfu per ml. samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. results:  all organisms, except p. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 cfu/ml) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 cfu/ml) hours. p. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 cfu/ml) or 66.0 (100 cfu/ml) hours. the 10-fold increase in inoculum  was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. the aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours)  between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p <  0.001), respectively. conclusion: no difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. the new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.
