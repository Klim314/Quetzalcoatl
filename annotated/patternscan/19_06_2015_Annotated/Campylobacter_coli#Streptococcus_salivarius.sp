TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
