TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae: the forgotten microorganism in neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a rarely cause of neonatal sepsis. Its prevalence is  low but with a mortality of 50%. Measures to prevent Streptococcus agalactiae transmission could help to increase Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD) in newborns. Transmission could be from mother intrapartum; or in those cases of late onset sepsis, the community carriers. Systematic vaccination with PCV-7 and PCV-13 has reduced IPD rates. We present a case of a newborn with no perinatal risk factors for infection. In the first 24 hours after surgery of an ovarian cyst, the patient started with bad general condition with fever and regular perfusion. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in blood culture. CONCLUSION: In neonatal sepsis, we always think in Streptococcus agalactiae. Streptococcus pneumoniae is rare but with a high morbidity and mortality. Systematic vaccination is a measure that has demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of Invasive pneumococcal disease.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Heart transplantation as salvage treatment of intractable infective endocarditis.
AB  - This study reports six consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation as salvage treatment for endocarditis (Duke criteria) with extensive perivalvular lesions and end-stage heart failure. The median age was 45 years (range, 24 to 64), and the aortic valve was affected in all patients. Pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1), or not documented (n = 1). All patients survived, with no relapse, after a median follow-up of 24.5 months. The 10 patients with heart transplantation for endocarditis previously reported also survived (median follow-up, 27.5 months). Heart transplantation may be considered as salvage treatment in selected patients with intractable infective endocarditis.
TI  - Transduction of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage Phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(A) and tet(O), to other Streptococcus species.
AB  - Phim46.1 - Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(A) and tet(O), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (M phenotype) and tetracycline - is widespread in S. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. Phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among S. pyogenes isolates, but no information is available about its transferability to other Streptococcus species. We thus investigated Phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of different Streptococcus species. Transductants were obtained from recipients of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus suis. Retransfer was always achieved, and from S. suis to S. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. In transductants Phim46.1 retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin C, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. The transductants shared the same Phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved RNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. No transfer occurred to recipients of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. A largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. Growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of Phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in S. suis. The S. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene atl.
TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Prevalence and predictors of bacterial meningitis in young infants with fever without a source.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Classical criteria differ when performing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in infants younger than 90 days with fever without a source (FWS). Our objectives were to analyze the prevalence and microbiology of bacterial meningitis in this group and its prevalence in relation to clinical and laboratory risk factors. METHODS: This is a substudy of a prospective registry including all infants of this age with FWS seen between September 2003 and August 2013 in a Pediatric Emergency Department of a Tertiary Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: Lumbar puncture was performed in 639 (27.0%) of the 2362 infants with FWS seen, the rate being higher in not well-appearing infants [60.9% vs. 25.7%; odds ratio (OR), 4.49] and in those </=21 days old (70.1% vs. 20.4%; OR, 9.14). Eleven infants were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis: 9 were </=21 days old (prevalence 2.8% vs. 0.1%; OR, 30.42) and 5 were not well-appearing infants (5.7% vs. 0.2%; OR, 23.06). Bacteria isolated were Streptococcus agalactiae (3), Escherichia coli (3), Listeria monocytogenes (3), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and Neisseria meningitidis (1). None of the 1975 well-appearing infants >21 days old were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, regardless of whether biomarkers were altered. CONCLUSIONS: In infants younger than 90 days with FWS, performing CSF analysis for ruling out bacterial meningitis must be strongly considered in not well-appearing infants and in those </=21 days old. The recommendation of systematically performing CSF analysis in well-appearing infants 22-90 days of age on the basis of analytical criteria alone must be reevaluated.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - Bacteremia in previously healthy children in emergency departments: clinical and  microbiological characteristics and outcome.
AB  - A blood culture (BC) is frequently requested in both patients with a suspected occult bacteremia/invasive infection as well as those with certain focal infections. Few data are available on the characteristics of patients in whom a bacteremia is identified in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED). A prospective multicenter registry was established by the Spanish Pediatric Emergency Society. Epidemiological data, complementary test results, clinical management, and final outcome were recorded. Data from the first three years of the registry were analyzed. A true bacterial pathogen grew in 932 of 65,169 BCs collected [1.43 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.34-1.51 %], with 711 of them collected in patients without previously known bacteremia risk factors. Among them, 335 (47.1 %) were younger than 1 year old and 467 (65.7 %) had a normal Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) on admission. Overall, the most frequently isolated bacterial species was Streptococcus pneumoniae (27.3 %; 47.6 % among patients with an altered PAT). The main pathogens were Escherichia coli (40.3 %) and S. agalactiae (35.7 %) among patients younger than 3 months, S. pneumoniae among patients 3-60 months old (40.0 %), and S. aureus (31.9 %) among patients over 60 months of age. Neisseria meningitidis was the leading cause of sepsis in patients older than 3 months. Eight patients died; none of them had a pneumococcal bacteremia and all had abnormal PAT findings on admission. S. pneumoniae is the main cause of bacteremia in patients without bacteremia risk factors who attended Spanish PEDs. Age and general appearance influence the frequency of each bacterial species. General appearance also influences the associated mortality.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - Subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. A small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. This review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. Understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.
TI  - Establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Final rule.
AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. This final rule implements a provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). GAIN is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. Based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' Acinetobacter species, Aspergillus species, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Campylobacter species, Candida species, Clostridium difficile, Coccidioides species, Cryptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), Enterococcus species, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. The preamble to the proposed rule described the factors the Agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. As described in the preamble of this final rule, FDA applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.
TI  - Recent trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan--a country where Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugated vaccines have just been introduced.
AB  - To investigate the trends in incidence and the characteristics of bacterial meningitis in Japan where Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7) were introduced in 2008 and 2010, respectively, which was 5-20 years after their introduction in western countries. The nationwide Japanese survey of pediatric and neonatal bacterial meningitis was performed in 2011 and 2012. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical data, and compared the information obtained in the previous nationwide survey database. We also investigated the risk factors for disease outcome. In the 2011-2012 surveys, 357 patients were evaluated. H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli were the main organisms. The number of patients hospitalized with bacterial meningitis per 1000 admissions decreased from 1.31 in 2009 to 0.43 in 2012 (p < 0.001). The incidence of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae meningitis also decreased from 0.66 to 0.08 (p < 0.001), and 0.30 to 0.06 (p < 0.001), respectively. Only 0-2 cases with Neisseria meningitidis were reported each year throughout 2001-2012. The median patient age was 10-12 months in 2001-2011, and became lower in 2012 (2 month old) (p < 0.001). The fatality rate for S. agalactiae is the highest (5.9% (11/187)) throughout 2001-2012 among the four organisms. Risk factors for death and sequelae were convulsions at onset, low CSF glucose, S. agalactiae etiology, and persistent positive CSF culture. Hib vaccine and PCV7 decreased the rate of bacterial meningitis. Earlier introduction of these vaccines may have prevented bacterial meningitis among Japanese children.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - Trends in bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal meningitis in England and Wales 2004-11: an observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meningitis remains one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, yet there are few population-based studies on the epidemiology, causes, or trends over time in meningitis, especially in industrialised countries. Our aim was to do such a study using routinely reported data available in England and Wales. METHODS: In England and Wales, UK National Health Service hospitals routinely report laboratory-confirmed pathogens electronically to Public Health England. Records of all positive bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal results from cerebrospinal fluid or from blood cultures in patients with clinical meningitis were extracted for analysis. The percentage change in annual incidence was estimated using linear regression analysis of the log of the annual incidence. FINDINGS: During 2004-11, 7061 cases of meningitis were reported (mean annual incidence 1.62 per 100,000 people, 95% CI 1.58-1.66), including 2594 cases in children (37%). The incidence of bacterial (1.44 per 100,000 people, 1.41-1.48), fungal (0.09, 0.08-0.10), and mycobacterial (0.09, 0.08-0.09) meningitis remained stable overall and across the age groups, apart from significant year-on-year increases in children younger than 3 months (978 cases; incidence 72.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 7.4%, 5.1-9.8; p<0.0001) driven mainly by group B streptococci (GBS), and in adults aged 65 years or older (752 cases; incidence 1.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 3.0%, 1.4-4.8; p<0.0001) primarily because of Escherichia coli. By contrast, meningococcal meningitis rates declined steadily, but remained the most common cause of meningitis in children. Overall, five groups of bacteria accounted for 60% (3790/6286) of bacterial meningitis cases: Neisseria meningitidis (1350 cases, 22%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1143, 18%), Staphylococcus aureus (652, 10%), GBS (326, 5%), and E coli (319, 5%). INTERPRETATION: In England and Wales, laboratory-based surveillance shows a remarkably stable incidence of bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial meningitis in recent years, although there were differences in individual trends among the main pathogens causing meningitis in different age groups. FUNDING: None.
TI  - Cardiopulmonary morbidity of streptococcal infections in a PICU.
AB  - AIM: The streptococci are important bacteria that cause serious childhood infections. We investigated cardiopulmonary morbidity associated with streptococcal infection and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. METHODS: A retrospective study between 2002 and 2013 of all children with a laboratory isolation of streptococcus. RESULTS: There were 40 (2.3%) PICU patients with streptococcal isolations including Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS, n = 7), Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS, n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP, n = 20), alpha-hemolytic (n = 4), beta-hemolytic (n = 2) and gama-hemolytic (n = 2) streptococci. Comparing among GAS, GBS and SP, respiratory isolates were more likely positive for GAS or SP (P = 0.033), whereas cerebrospinal fluid was more likely positive for GBS (P = 0.002). All GAS and GBS, and the majority of SP (90%) were sensitive to penicillin. All SP specimens were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. These infections were associated with high PICU mortality of 43%, 20% and 25%, respectively. Isolation of streptococci was associated with a 30% mortality and high rates of need for mechanical ventilatory and inotropic supports. Patients with GAS, SP or any streptococcal isolation had relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI), P value] of PICU deaths of 7.5 (CI 3.1-18.1, P < 0.0001), 4.5 (CI 2.0-9.8, P < 0.0002) and 5.7 (CI 3.4-9.5, P < 0.0001), respectively. In SP, older children had significantly higher prevalence of premorbid conditions such as malignancy, mental retardation/cerebral palsy +/- seizure disorders, chromosomal or genetic disorders (P = 0.003) than children <5 years of age. Serotypes were available for some of these specimens that included 19A, 6B, 3 and 6C. There were four SP deaths with multiorgan system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome (two 19A and two serotype 3). CONCLUSIONS: Severe streptococcal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite treatment with systemic antibiotics and intensive care unit support. GAS and SP affect the lungs of children, whereas GBS more likely causes meningitis in infants. The expanded coverage of newer polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines can probably prevent infections by serotypes 19A, 19F, 6B and 3.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in Malawian infants <2 months of age: etiology and susceptibility to World Health Organization first-line antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal meningitis is an important cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa and requires urgent empiric treatment with parenteral administered antibiotics. Here we describe the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and suitability of the World Health Organization first-line recommended antibiotics (penicillin and gentamicin) for bacterial meningitis in young infants in Malawi. METHODS: We reviewed all cerebrospinal fluid samples received from infants </=2 months of age with clinically suspected meningitis between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008, at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. RESULTS: We identified 259 culture-positive isolates from 259 infants </=2 months of age. Sixty isolates were from neonates </=7 days old, in whom the most common pathogens were Group B Streptococcus (27/60; 45.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13/60; 21.7%) and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (7/60; 11.7%). One hundred and ninety one isolates were from young infants who were >7 days and </=2 months of age. In this group, the most common isolates were S. pneumoniae (80/191; 41.9%), Group B Streptococcus (38/191; 19.9%) and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (34/191; 17.8%). More isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone than to the combination of penicillin and gentamicin (218/220; 99.1% vs. 202/220; 91.8%, Fisher's exact test P = 0.006). In particular, Gram-negative isolates were significantly more susceptible to ceftriaxone than to gentamicin (72/74; 97.3% vs. 63/74; 85.1%, Fisher's exact test P = 0.020). Penicillin and gentamicin provided less coverage for Gram-negative than Gram-positive isolates (74/86; 86.0% vs. 155/163; 95.1%, chi = 6.24, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In view of these results, the World Health Organization recommendations for empiric penicillin and gentamicin for suspected neonatal meningitis should be reevaluated.
TI  - [Rapid identification of meningitis due to bacterial pathogens].
AB  - We constructed a new real-time PCR method to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patient due to bacterial meningitis. The eight pathogens targeted in the PCR are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aurues, Neisseria meningitides, Listeria monocytogenes, Esherichia coli, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 hour. The pathogens were detected in 72% of the CSF samples (n=115) by real-time PCR, but in only 48% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. The detection rate of pathogens with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration.In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.
TI  - Epidemiology of bacteremia in febrile infants in the United States.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fever in infants is a common clinical dilemma. The objective of this  study was to present data from hospital systems across the northeast, southeast, mid-west, and western United States to identify the pathogens causing bacteremia in febrile infants admitted to general care units. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of positive blood culture results in febrile infants aged </=90 days admitted to a general care unit across 6 hospital systems. Data were collected from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2012 from emergency departments and general inpatient units. Cultures from ICUs, central lines, or infants who had complex comorbidities were excluded, as were repeat cultures positive for the same bacteria. Common contaminants were considered pathogens if they were treated as such. RESULTS: We identified 181 cases of bacteremia in 177 infants. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (42%), followed by group B Streptococcus (23%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely in older infants (P = .01). Non-low-risk bacteremic infants were more likely to have E. coli or group B Streptococcus than low-risk bacteremic infants. We identified no cases of Listeria monocytogenes. Variation between sites was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest and most geographically diverse study to date examining the epidemiology of bacteremia in infants. We suggest E. coli is the most common cause of bacteremia in previously healthy febrile infants admitted to a general inpatient unit. We identified no cases of L monocytogenes and question whether empirical therapy remains necessary for this pathogen.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children in Iceland, 1975-2010: a nationwide epidemiological study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is a serious and potentially rapid life-threatening disease. Therefore, to ensure appropriate treatment, early recognition of signs and symptoms is imperative, along with knowledge of the epidemiology and microbiology of the disease. METHODS: A long-term, nationwide epidemiological study of bacterial causes of meningitis in children (</= 18 y) in Iceland during the period 1975-2010 was carried out. A detailed chart review was performed of all cases diagnosed in 1995-2010. RESULTS: A total of 477 children were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis during the period 1975-2010. Of these, 67% were aged under 5 y. The most common pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (n = 265), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 132), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 47), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 19); their incidences varied according to age. The age-specific incidence (cases/100,000/y) dropped from 26 in 1975 to 1 in 2010 (p < 0.001). The most common symptoms during the period 1995-2010 were fever (92%), vomiting (67%), nuchal rigidity (60%), and rashes/petechiae (51%). H. influenzae type b disappeared following implementation of Hib vaccination in 1989, and, likewise, the incidence of meningococcal meningitis fell significantly after vaccination against meningococcus serogroup C was initiated in 2002 (p < 0.001). The overall 30-day case fatality rate of bacterial meningitis was 4.4% and remained unchanged during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of childhood bacterial meningitis has been reduced significantly by successful vaccinations against H. influenzae type b and N. meningitidis serogroup C. Nevertheless, the case fatality rate has remained unchanged and thus the disease is still a serious threat to childhood health. Further prevention by novel vaccines and improved management of childhood meningitis is an exciting challenge.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Noncovalent association of protein and capsular polysaccharide on bacteria-sized  latex beads as a model for polysaccharide-specific humoral immunity to intact gram-positive extracellular bacteria.
AB  - Intact Streptococcus pneumoniae expressing type 14 capsular polysaccharide (PPS14) and type III S. agalactiae containing a PPS14 core capsule identical to PPS14 exhibit noncovalent associations of PPS14 and bacterial protein, in contrast to soluble covalent conjugates of these respective Ags. Both bacteria and conjugates induce murine PPS14-specific IgG responses dependent on CD4(+) T cells. Further, secondary immunization with conjugate and S. agalactiae, although not S. pneumoniae, results in a boosted response. However, in contrast to conjugate, PPS14-specific IgG responses to bacteria lack affinity maturation use the 44.1-idiotype and are dependent on marginal zone B cells. To better understand the mechanism underlying this dichotomy, we developed a minimal model of intact bacteria in which PPS14 and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) were stably attached to 1 mum (bacteria-sized) latex beads, but not directly linked to each other, in contrast to PPS14-PspA conjugate. Beads coated simultaneously with PPS14+[PspA], similar to conjugate, induced in mice boosted PPS14-specific IgG secondary responses, dependent on T cells and ICOS-dependent costimulation, and in which priming could be achieved with PspA alone. In contrast to conjugate, but similar to intact bacteria, the primary PPS14-specific IgG response to beads coated simultaneously with PPS14+[PspA] peaked rapidly, with the secondary response highly enriched for the 44.1-idiotype and lacking affinity maturation. These results demonstrate that noncovalent association in a particle, of polysaccharide and protein, recapitulates essential immunologic characteristics of intact bacteria that are distinct from soluble covalent conjugates of these respective Ags.
TI  - Streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  - The role of Streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is considered to be of little relevance. We aimed to describe a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (SVO), to analyze the clinical features associated with different Streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with VO caused by Staphylococcus aureus. An incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of SVO (1991-2011) were performed. Statistical comparison of SVO by different species and between them and staphylococcal VO was carried out. Over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of VOs and SVOs per year (p <0.05). Among 58 cases of SVO, those caused by non-viridans streptococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked VO by S. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). In contrast, the latter have a sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis (p <0.05). Among non-viridans SVOs, concomitant infection was specifically related to S. pneumoniae (p <0.05). In conclusion, SVO presents a wide range of clinical patterns. The relationship between VO and diagnosis of endocarditis was established with SVO caused by the viridans group. Whereas non-viridans SVO mimics acute characteristics of VO caused by S. aureus, cases of viridans SVO are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. The increased incidence of SVO during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.
TI  - Streptococcal endophthalmitis in pediatric keratoprosthesis.
AB  
TI  - Immunosuppressive property within the Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall that inhibits generation of T follicular helper, germinal center, and plasma cell response to a coimmunized heterologous protein.
AB  - We previously demonstrated that intact, inactivated Streptococcus pneumoniae (unencapsulated strain R36A) inhibits IgG responses to a number of coimmunized soluble antigens (Ags). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of this inhibition and whether other extracellular bacteria exhibited similar effects. No inhibition was observed if R36A was given 24 h before or after immunization with soluble chicken ovalbumin (cOVA), indicating that R36A acts transiently during the initiation of the immune response. Using transgenic cOVA-specific CD4(+) T cells, we observed that R36A had no significant effect on T-cell activation (24 h) or generation of regulatory T cells (day 7) and only a modest effect on T-cell proliferation (48 to 96 h) in response to cOVA. However, R36A mediated a significant reduction in the formation of Ag-specific splenic germinal center T follicular helper (GC Tfh) and GC B cells and antibody-secreting cells in the spleen and bone marrow in response to cOVA or cOVA conjugated to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl hapten (NP-cOVA). Of note, the inhibitory effect of intact R36A on the IgG anti-cOVA response could be reproduced using R36A-derived cell walls. In contrast to R36A, neither inactivated, unencapsulated, intact Neisseria meningitidis nor Streptococcus agalactiae inhibited the OVA-specific IgG response. These results suggest a novel immunosuppressive property within the cell wall of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  - The objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the Milk Analysis Laboratory (L.I.G.A.L.) at Galicia, Spain from June 2005 to September 2011. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as Cluster Analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. The decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in IMI caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. The obtained results reflect a greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional classification into contagious or environmental. Staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. Among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, Strep. uberis showed a different behavior to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species and Streptococcus other than Strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. Time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as Cluster Analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. Furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.
TI  - Prospective multi-centre sentinel surveillance for Haemophilus influenzae type b  & other bacterial meningitis in Indian children.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is one of the leading bacterial causes of invasive disease in populations without access to Hib conjugate vaccines (Hib-CV). India has recently decided to introduce Hib-CV into the routine immunization programme in selected States. Longitudinal data quantifying the burden of bacterial meningitis and the proportion of disease caused by various bacteria are needed to track the impact of Hib-CV once introduced. A hospital-based sentinel surveillance network was established at four places in the country and this study reports the results of this ongoing surveillance. METHODS: Children aged 1 to 23 months with suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled in Chennai, Lucknow, New Delhi, and Vellore between July 2008 and June 2010. All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were tested using cytological, biochemical, and culture methods. Samples with abnormal CSF (>/=10 WBC per mul) were tested by latex agglutination test for common paediatric bacterial meningitis pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 708 patients with abnormal CSF were identified, 89 of whom had a bacterial pathogen confirmed. Hib accounted for the majority of bacteriologically confirmed cases, 62 (70%), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B Streptococcus were identified in 12 (13%) and seven (8%) cases, respectively. The other eight cases were a mix of other bacteria. The proportion of abnormal CSF and probable bacterial meningitis that was caused by Hib was 74 and 58 per cent lower at Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, which had a 41 per cent coverage of Hib-CV among all suspected meningitis cases, compared to the combined average proportion at the other three centres where a coverage between 1 and 8 per cent was seen (P<0.001 and P= 0.05, respectively). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Hib was found to be the predominant cause of bacterial meningitis in young children in diverse geographic locations in India. Possible indications of herd immunity was seen at CMC compared to sites with low immunization coverage with Hib-CV. As Hib is the most common pathogen in bacterial meningitis, Hib-CV would have a large impact on bacterial meningitis in Indian children.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. In this study, we examine susceptibility among Gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. A total of 9,422 Gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from Europe and North America. One-third of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. All S. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). Ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (P < 0.0001 for both). Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in Africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in Asia-Pacific Rim (38%). Penicillin resistance occurred in one-fifth of all S. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in Africa to 65% in Europe. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. Enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (P < 0.001). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in TEST 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid of children with suspected acute meningitis in a Nigerian tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the common aetiolog of acute bacterial meningitis in children and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study with a review of cerebrospinal fluid culture reports of paediatric patients aged 0-15 years, suspected of acute meningitis in the Medical Microbiology Department of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria from October 2006 to October 2009 from October 2006 to October 2009. RESULTS: A positive culture bacterial isolation rate of 3.3% (n=50/1500) with prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), Neisseria meningitidis (22%), Escherichia coli (16%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Group B streptococci (8%) and Enterococci (8%) which were susceptible to ceftriaxone (96%), cefotaxime (95%) and ciprofloxacin (93%) across the bacterial isolates. Neonates were 55% (n=6.8/12.4) most at risk. CONCLUSION: Neonates are the most at risk of acute bacterial meningitis. In the absence of antibiotic susceptibility report, ceftriaxone should be considered as a first choice reliable antibiotic for empirical treatment of meningitis in children, in this environment.

AB  
TI  - Endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2012. Endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis. Cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. Clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and S aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. Treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). Two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. Systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). Seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline HCL tested against Gram-positive pathogens: SENTRY Program results using CLSI and EUCAST breakpoint criteria.
AB  - Tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter spp. Also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), and regulatory-approved documents. We have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline HCL and minocycline when tested against contemporary Gram-positive pathogens. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline HCL activity via reference methods (M07-A9) using a worldwide collection of S. aureus (SA; 4917 strains with 1955 MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 1899), S. pyogenes (GRA; 246), and S. agalactiae (GRB; 217). Regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline HCL of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for MRSA/SPN/GRB/GRA, respectively. Lower EUCAST susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/mL) for GRA to -8.9% (</=1 mug/mL) for MRSA (97.2% susceptible by CLSI; 88.3% by EUCAST). Use of tetracycline HCL-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (CLSI) to 98.4% to 99.6% (EUCAST) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the CLSI breakpoints (14.7%) compared to EUCAST criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for MRSA testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. In conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline HCL when testing SA (especially MRSA) and pathogenic streptococci. When testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. We conclude that EUCAST breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/mL) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Inducible clindamycin resistance in beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to macrolides in beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae arises primarily due to Erm(B) or Mef(A). Erm(B) typically confers high level resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSB phenotype), whereas Mef(A) confers low level resistance to macrolides only (M phenotype). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of macrolide resistance mechanisms in isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci in Israel, with particular emphasis on inducible MLSB phenotype. METHODS: We collected 316 clinical isolates of streptococci during May-August 2010. Erythromycin resistance mechanism was determined by the erythromycin-clindamycin double disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates were 19.4% and 13.4% for S. pneumoniae, 4.7% and 1.6% for group A Streptococcus (GAS), 17% and 17% for group B Streptococcus (GBS), and 38.8% and 27.8% for group G Streptococcus (GGS) respectively. The most common resistance mechanism for all streptococci was constitutive MLSB (cMLSB). Inducible MLSs (iMLSB) mechanism was found in 3% of all strains and represented 25% of resistance mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance and the distribution of resistance mechanisms differ among beta-hemolytic streptococci and S. pneumoniae, with GBS, GGS and S. pneumoniae showing the highest resistance rate. Macrolide or lincosamide cannot be empirically used for severe streptococcal infections before strains are proved to be susceptible. Continuous surveillance of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance patterns among streptococci is needed.
TI  - No change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the neonatal ICU over two decades.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify trends in early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis neonatal rates and to evaluate the appropriateness of the empirical antibiotic protocols. DESIGN: A 17-yr (1993-2009) analysis of positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. SETTING: The two neonatal ICUs at the Hadassah- Hebrew University Medical Center. RESULTS: During this period, 991 infants had at least one episode of either bacteremia or meningitis. The overall incidence of early-onset sepsis was 0.64 per 1,000 live births with a nonsignificant trend over the study period (p = 0.37). The overall incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the incidence rates (p = 0.021). The incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the prevalence rates (p = 0.021). The prevalence of early-onset group B Streptococcus bacteremia decreased significantly throughout the study period. Among late-onset sepsis, Gram-positive and fungi infection rates were stable over time, while Gram-negative infection rates showed a significant positive trend (p = 0.007). No significant change in the susceptibility rate of the isolated Gram-negative bacteria in late-onset sepsis for the common antibacterial drugs was found. About 85% and 90% of the isolated organisms were susceptible to our early-onset sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin) and late-onset sepsis (vancomycin and cefotaxime) protocols, respectively, and these rates were stable over the study period (p = .1 and .55, respectively). Sepsis-related mortality was higher among Gram- negative sepsis cases resistant to our empiric antibiotic protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Our empiric antibiotic protocols are appropriate despite their continuous use over the last 17 yrs. This may have been achieved by the use of a controlled antibiotic program and infection control efforts.
TI  - Common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. Their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. Many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. Among them, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis are discussed here. An environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. Thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding RNAs are the topic of this chapter. The regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. Understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of black thyme (Thymbra spicata L.) essential oils.
AB  - In order to study antimicrobial effects of essential oils of Wild Thyme (Thymbra  spicata L.) on two Gram positive bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae RJTTC1978 and Staphylococcus aureus RJTTC1885) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli RJTTC2409 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RJTTC1097), the research carried out with five concentrations (0.2, 2, 4, 10 and 20 microl) using disk diffusion and microbroth dilution (to determine MIC and MBC) methods at Ilam University during 2010. Tetracycline and Gentamicin discs were used as control. Chemical composition of the EOs was analyzed by GC-MS. Antioxidant activity of the essential oils (EOs) was measured following DPPH assay. Results showed that Carvacrol (60.36%), gamma-Terpinene (15.09%), beta-Myrcene (2.15%), trans-Caryophyllene (1.78%) and alpha-Thujene (1.54%) were the main components of the oils. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity revealed that the oils were active against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. However, the biggest growth inhibitory zone (33.34 +/- 0.5 mm) was recorded on Streptococcus agalactiae at 20 microl/ml concentration. The lowest MIC (3.12 microl/ml) observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, while minimum MBC (6.25 microl/ml) recorded on Klebsiella pneumoniae. Radical-scavenging ability of the EOs and BHT ranged from 9.93 +/- 2.57 to 77.81 +/- 1.3% and 80.48 +/- 0.56 to 10.66 +/- 1.11%, respectively. The inhibiting effect of Thymbra oils was stronger than the synthetic BHT, particularly at lower concentrations, as IC50 concentration of EOs for the reduction of DPPH radicals was 1.28 microl/ml which was lower than IC50 calculated for BHT (1.31 microl/ml). The total phenolic content, determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, was 1.52 +/- 0.15 mg PyE/ml EOs.
TI  - [Childhood bacterial meningitis trends in Japan from 2009 to 2010].
AB  - We conducted a pediatric survey of bacterial meningitis epidemiology from January 2009 to December 2010 in Japan, and obtained the following results for 314 cases (186 boys, 124 girls, and 4 with gender not reported). Children younger than one year old accounted for the majority of cases (51.2%, 161/314), and the incidence decreased with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae (in children aged 1 month to 5 years old) was the most common cause of infection (53.2%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 month to 12 years, 24.2%), Streptococcus agalactiae (0-4 months, 7.6%), and Escherichia coli (0-3 months, 3.2%). Susceptibility tests showed that 50.1% (78/153) of the H. influenzae isolates and 63.0% (46/73) of the S. pneumoniae isolates were drug-resistant. Combinations of ampicillin and cephem or carbapenem and other beta-lactams were mainly used as the initial antibiotics for patients under 4 months of age (77.8%, 42/54), and a carbapenem and other beta-lactam combination was used for patients aged 4 months and older (76.4%, 198/259). The final antibiotics for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were mainly cefotaxime (CTX) or ceftriaxone (CTRX) and carbapenem, respectively. The overall fatality rate was 2.0% (6/305). Since the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib vaccine) and the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) are not widely used in Japan, only 5 patients in our cohort (all with meningitis not caused by H. influenzae) had been immunized with the Hib vaccine, and none had been immunized with the PCV7 vaccine. No remarkable changes in the characteristics of pediatric meningitis have been observed for several years in Japan.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - [Meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2010].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Annually 2 000-3 000 cases of meningitis and encephalitis are notified to the Polish surveillance system. The leading etiologic agents of the bacterial infections are: N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type B and L. monocytogenes. The most common causes of bacterial infections in children are: E. coli, S. agalactiae and H. influenzae type B. The viral infections are mainly caused by the following pathogens: Echovirus, Coxsackie virus group A and B. The agents responsible for the viral infections are also: arboviruses, Herpes simplex virus and mumps virus. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present article are to analyze the epidemiology of meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2010 and to present the information on the vaccines used to prevent the discussed infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis was based on the data retrieved from the questionnaires used for the surveillance purposes, aggregated data on meningitis and encephalitis published in "Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2010", aggregated data on the vaccination coverage published in "Vaccinations in Poland in 2010", "Case definitions for the infectious diseases used for the surveillance purposes in 2009-2011" and Polish Immunization Programme for 2010. RESULTS: In 2010, Poland reported 3 063 neuroinfections--nearly 22% more than in 2009. The incidence rate was 8.03 cases per 100 000 population. From the analysis of data transpired that of the notified cases, 1 619 were of viral etiology, 846--were bacterial and 598 of other or unknown origin. Given the bacterial infections of determined etiology, the leading pathogenic agent was S. pneumoniae (180 cases), following by N. meningitidis (146 cases) and Haemophilus influenzae typu B (11 cases). Among confirmed cases of the viral infections, the predominant were tick-borne encephalitis cases (294). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the data from 2009, the epidemiologic situation of the meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2010 has not changed significantly.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect ABSTRACT: The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new MRSA-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2010. In over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility. An alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the USA. Very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at </= 8 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing S. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone MIC at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible category) when testing Haemophilus influenzae. Only when testing indicated Enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). These presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  - Vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.
TI  - Maternal HIV infection and vertical transmission of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-exposed newborns may be at higher risk of sepsis because of immune system aberrations, impaired maternal antibody transfer and altered exposure to pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a study (clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00136370) conducted between April 2004 and October 2007 in South Africa. We used propensity score matching to evaluate the association between maternal HIV infection and (1) vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens; (2) vertical transmission of pathogens to the newborn; and (3) sepsis within 3 days of birth (EOS) or between 4-28 days of life (LOS). RESULTS: Colonization with group B Streptococcus (17% vs 23%, P = .0002), Escherichia coli (47% vs 45%, P = .374), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7% vs 10%, P = .008) differed modestly between HIV-infected and uninfected women, as did vertical transmission rates. Maternal HIV infection was not associated with increased risk of neonatal EOS or LOS, although culture-confirmed EOS was >3 times higher among HIV-exposed infants (P = .05). When compared with HIV-unexposed, neonates, HIV-exposed, uninfected neonates (HEU) had a lower risk of EOS (20.6 vs 33.7 per 1000 births; P = .046) and similar rate of LOS (5.8 vs 4.1; P = .563). HIV-infected newborns had a higher risk than HEU of EOS (134 vs 21.5; P < .0001) and LOS (26.8 vs 5.6; P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HIV infection was not associated with increased risk of maternal bacterial colonization, vertical transmission, EOS, or LOS. HIV-infected neonates, however, were at increased risk of EOS and LOS.
TI  - Identification of the actin and plasminogen binding regions of group B streptococcal phosphoglycerate kinase.
AB  - Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), present on the surface of group B streptococcus (GBS), has previously been demonstrated to bind the host proteins actin and plasminogen. The actin and plasminogen binding sites of GBS-PGK were identified using truncated GBS-PGK molecules, followed by peptide mapping. These experiments identified two actin and plasminogen binding sites located between amino acids 126-134 and 204-208 of the 398-amino acid-long GBS-PGK molecule. Substitution of the lysine residues within these regions with alanine resulted in significantly reduced binding to both actin and plasminogen. In addition, conversion of the glutamic acid residue at amino acid 133 to proline, the amino acid found at this position for the PGK protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, also resulted in significantly reduced binding to actin and plasminogen. These results demonstrate that the lysine residues at amino acid positions 126, 127, 130, 204, and 208 along with the glutamic acid residue at amino acid position 133 are necessary for actin and plasminogen binding by GBS-PGK.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - Characterization of a Streptococcus suis tet(O/W/32/O)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - Mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. They may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. Initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. In the genus Streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(O/W/32/O)] was first discovered in Streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. In this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(O/W/32/O) gene-carrying mobile element from an S. suis isolate. tet(O/W/32/O) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% G+C; 17 open reading frames [ORFs] identified). The novel element, which we designated 15K, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(B) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aadE (streptomycin) and aphA (kanamycin). 15K appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. In the integrated form, 15K was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ICE) (50.5% G+C; 55 ORFs), which we designated ICESsu32457. An approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15K element was identified. The novel ICE was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic Streptococcus species (S. suis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15K element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  - We investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. Using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it is now a clinical problem in Japan. Six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). Major causative bacteria detected were Escherichia coli (65.0 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), Streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). From 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were E. coli (61.5 %), E. faecalis (13.7 %), K. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and S. agalactiae (4.0 %). The sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and cephems of E. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. In regard to infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [LVFX] >/=4 mug/mL), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of FQ administration within 1 month. Although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. The major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli were a history of FQ administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. It was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of FQ administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.
TI  - Relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. The balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the Lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe for humans. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of Lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on Lactobacilli isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to Babylon Hospital of Maternity and Paediatrics in Babylon province, Iraq. The study involved the role of intrauterine device among married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. This study also involved studying probiotic role of Lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. RESULTS: Results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. Intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. The most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All Lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (S. aureus, E. coli). Lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. Results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between Lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. This may be attributed to the production of defense factors by Lactobacilli. CONCLUSION: The types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (Lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Structurally identical capsular polysaccharide expressed by intact group B streptococcus versus Streptococcus pneumoniae elicits distinct murine polysaccharide-specific IgG responses in vivo.
AB  - We previously reported distinct differences in the murine in vivo Ig polysaccharide (PS)-specific responses to intact Streptococcus pneumoniae compared with responses to Neisseria meningitidis and that in each case, the bacterial subcapsular domain markedly influences the Ig response to the associated PS. In light of potentially unique contributions of biochemically distinct capsular PS and/or their characteristic attachments to the underlying bacterium, it remains unresolved whether different bacterial subcapsular domains can exert differential effects on PS-specific Ig responses to distinct bacterial pathogens. In this report, we used a mutant strain of group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae) type III (GBS-III) that expresses desialylated capsular polysaccharide of GBS-III, biochemically identical to capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide type 14 (PPS14) of Streptococcus pneumoniae (intact inactivated Streptococcus pneumoniae, capsular type 14, Pn14), directly to compare the in vivo PPS14-specific IgG responses to two distinct gram-positive bacteria. Although both GBS-III and Pn14 elicited relatively rapid primary PPS14-specific IgG responses dependent on CD4(+) T cells, B7-dependent costimulation, and CD40-CD40L interactions, only GBS-III induced a highly boosted ICOS-dependent PPS14-specific IgG response after secondary immunization. Of note, priming with Pn14 and boosting with GBS-III, although not isolated PPS14, elicited a similar boosted PPS14-specific IgG response that was dependent on CD4(+) T cells during secondary immunization, indicating that Pn14 primes for memory but, unlike GBS-III, fails to elicit it. The inability of Pn14 to elicit a boosted PPS14-specific IgG response was overcome by coimmunization with unencapsulated GBS-III. Collectively, these data establish that structurally identical capsular PS expressed by two distinct gram-positive extracellular bacteria can indeed elicit distinct PS-specific IgG responses in vivo.
TI  - A multi-target real-time PCR assay for rapid identification of meningitis-associated microorganisms.
AB  - A central nervous system (CNS) infection, such as meningitis, is a serious and life-threatening condition. Bacterial meningitis can be severe and may result in brain damage, disability or even death. Rapid diagnosis of CNS infections and identification of the pathogenic microorganisms are needed to improve the patient outcome. Bacterial culture of a patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is currently considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing bacterial meningitis. From the CSF cultures researchers can assess the in vitro susceptibility of the causative microorganism to determine the best antibiotic treatment. However, many of the culture assays, such as microscopy and the latex agglutination test are not sensitive. To enhance pathogen detection in CSF samples we developed a multi-target real-time PCR assay that can rapidly identify six different microorganisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Cryptococcus neoformans. In this study we applied this PCR analysis to 296 CSF samples from patients who were suspected of having meningitis. Of the 296 samples that were examined, 59 samples were positive according to the CSF culture and/or molecular assays. Forty-six CSF samples were positive for both the CSF culture and our real-time PCR assay, while 13 samples were positive for the real-time PCR but negative for the traditional assays. This discrepancy may have been caused by the fact that these samples were collected from 23 patients who were treated with antimicrobials before CSF sampling.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sp Group F, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as IC(50) . Mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. Gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. Regarding phenolic extracts, GSE (grape seed extract) and GSE-O (oligomeric-rich fraction from GSE) were the ones that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. The antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.
TI  - Detection of acute childhood meningitis by PCR, culture and agglutination tests in Tabriz, Iran.
AB  - Meningitis is one of the hazardous and life threatening infections and is associated with mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine etiological agents of childhood bacterial meningitis. The culture, Gram staining, agglutination and PCR assays were used to examine CSF specimens from 277 patients with presumed bacterial meningitis for the occurrence of 4 most common infectious agents consist of N. meningitis, H. influnsae, S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae between 2008 and 2009 at different wards of the Children Hospital of Tabriz. The mean age of patients was 35 +/- 2 (Mean +/- SEM) month, (minimum 11 days maximum 14 years), of all cases 59.6% male and 40.4% female. Overall the diagnosis was confirmed with a CSF culture in 11/277 (3.97%), by agglutination test in 14/277 (5.05%). The isolated bacteria included S. pneumoniae 5 cases, H. influnsae 2 cases, N. meningitis 3 cases and P. aeroginusae 1 case. A positive PCR assay allowed us to diagnose bacterial meningitis in 19 patients (6.8%). In the present study, we found PCR to be a useful and sensitive method for the detection of bacterial DNA in the CSF samples from suspected meningitis patients. Furthermore, to maximize management of meningitis cases, a combination of culture and PCR is necessary.
TI  - Subtractive genomics approach to identify putative drug targets and identification of drug-like molecules for beta subunit of DNA polymerase III in Streptococcus species.
AB  - The prolonged use of the antibiotics over the years has transformed many organisms resistant to multiple drugs. This has made the field of drug discovery of vital importance in curing various infections and diseases. The drugs act by binding to a specific target protein of prime importance for the cell's survival. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes are the few gram positive organisms that have developed resistance to drugs. It causes pneumonia, meningitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bacteremia, pericarditis, and arthritis infections. The present study was carried out to identify potential drug targets and inhibitors for beta subunit of DNA polymerase III in these three Streptococcus species that might facilitate the discovery of novel drugs in near future. Various steps were adopted to find out novel drug targets. And finally 3D structure of DNA polymerase III subunit beta was modeled. The ligand library was generated from various databases to find the most suitable ligands. All the ligands were docked using Molegro Virtual Docker and the lead molecules were investigated for ADME and toxicity.
TI  - Identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - The design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. In order to identify potentially conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from Staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. By comparison with previous screening data from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. In particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the N-terminal domain of SACOL0609 (SdrD), the C-terminal domain of SACOL0723 (ScaB) and the C-terminus of SACOL1140 (IsdA) from Staph. aureus. The three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. The antisera were also able to opsonize both Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. The conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.
TI  - Escherichia coli Isolated from Urinary Tract Infections of Lebanese Patients between 2000 and 2009: Epidemiology and Profiles of Resistance.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the bacterial etiology of urinary tract infections in one of the busiest hospitals of Lebanon and to examine the epidemiologic and microbiologic properties of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections of Lebanese patients over a 10-year period. Methods. This retrospective study analyzed the data generated between 2000 and 2009 (10,013 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). Bacterial identification was based on standard culture and biochemical characteristics of isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method, and ESBL production was detected by synergy with third-generation cephalosporins and amoxiclav. Results. E. coli was the most frequent isolate throughout the ten years (60.64% of the total isolates). It was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae. E. coli occurred more frequently in women (69.8%) than in men (61.4%). The lowest percentage of susceptibility of E. coli was manifested against piperacillin and ampicillin. An increase in the production of ESBL was observed (2.3% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2009). Conclusions. The etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility profiles are important to be evaluated in countries like Lebanon where a severe misuse of antibiotics at all levels is observed.
TI  - Mechanisms underlying in vivo polysaccharide-specific immunoglobulin responses to intact extracellular bacteria.
AB  - Polysaccharides (PS) have historically been viewed as T cell-independent antigens. However, in this paper I propose a new concept, based on substantial data from my laboratory over the previous 10 years, that during infections with PS-encapsulated extracellular bacteria, PS-specific IgG responses are largely CD4(+) T cell dependent. Thus, capsular PS is typically encountered by the immune system covalently attached to the underlying subcapsular bacterial domain. I speculate that noncovalent association of PS with immunogenic proteins within the bacterial particle leads to recruitment of protein-specific CD4(+) T cell help for the anti-PS response. However, differences in the composition and/or structure of the subcapsular domain of different extracellular bacteria may result in distinct anti-PS responses as well as differential effects on the immune response to coimmunizing soluble antigens. CD4(+) T cell help for IgG anti-PS responses during infections with extracellular bacteria is likely to promote opsonic clearance of these rapidly growing pathogens. However, the expression of immunosuppressive components by certain bacteria may also serve to dampen such responses.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, an Emerging Drug-Resistant Animal and Human Pathogen.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. Recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the S. suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. Resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. Some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. The available information strongly suggests that S. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. S. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.
TI  - The microbiology of tonsils in khamis civil hospital, saudi arabia.
AB  - Objectives. Tonsillitis is a common infection in all age groups, especially under the age of five. Organisms causing this condition vary from place to place. Our aim is to find out the main causative agents of this condition in our hospital. Patients and Methods. Fifty-two consenting patients who needed tonsillectomy in Khamis civil hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between September 2006 and April 2007, were enrolled for the study. Swabs were taken from their inner surfaces and cultured for anaerobes and aerobes according to standard microbiological techniques. Results. Fifty-two patients, consisting of 30 males and 22 females were enrolled. Their mean age was 9.81 +/- 6.47. Nearly 65% of patients had positive cultures while 35% were negative. The commonest bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (44.1%); and Group B Streptococcus (35.3 %). Two Gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, (8.82%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.94 %), were also isolated. No anaerobe was isolated. Conclusion. Gram-positive cocci, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae), are the major causes of tonsillitis requiring surgery in our hospital. Antibiotic treatment of this condition should be directed largely against these organisms.
TI  - Clinico-radiological features of subarachnoid hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images in patients with meningitis.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the clinical and radiological features of meningitis with subarachnoid diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical features, laboratory data, and radiological findings, including the number and distribution of subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions and other radiological abnormalities, of 18 patients seen at five institutions were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients consisted of eight males and 10 females, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 82 years (median 65 years). Causative organisms were bacteria in 15 patients, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes. The remaining three were fungal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions were multiple in 16 of the 18 cases (89%) and predominantly distributed around the frontal lobe in 16 of the 18 cases (89%). In addition to subarachnoid abnormality, subdural empyema, cerebral infarction, and intraventricular empyema were found in 50, 39, and 39%, respectively. Compared with paediatric patients, adult patients with bacterial meningitis tended to have poor prognoses (7/10 versus 1/5; p = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Both bacterial and fungal meningitis could cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on DWI, predominantly around the frontal lobe. This finding is often associated with poor prognosis in adult bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - The immune response to group B streptococcus type III capsular polysaccharide is  directed to the -Glc-GlcNAc-Gal- backbone epitope.
AB  - The structures of the branched capsular polysaccharides of group B streptococcus  type III (GBSIIIPS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 (Pn14PS) are identical apart from the (alpha2-->3)-linked sialic acid in the side chains of GBSIIIPS. The present study tries to determine the minimal epitope in GBSIIIPS, using both a panel of anti-Pn14PS mouse sera and sera of humans vaccinated with either Pn14PS or GBSIIIPS. Type-specific Pn14PS antibodies that recognize the branched structure of Pn14PS have a low affinity for the native GBSIIIPS. Desialylation of GBSIIIPS results in dramatically higher affinity of anti-Pn14PS antibodies. Epitope specific anti-Pn14PS mouse antibodies and human sera of PCV7 vaccinees only recognized structures with the branching element -Glc-(Gal-)GlcNAc-, in particular -Gal-Glc-(Gal-)GlcNAc- in Pn14PS. On the other hand anti-GBSIIIPS human antibodies recognize predominantly the linear structure in the backbone of Pn14PS or GBSIIIPS, i.e., -Glc-GlcNAc-Gal-. This difference in antigenicity of Pn14PS and GBSIIIPS is in agreement with the difference in flexibility of the two polysaccharides caused by the presence or absence of sialic acid.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  - Mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. Many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or Staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. A wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies level. These include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. The strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. Molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and disease causation. In this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Structural differences between the Streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: SrtA and SrtC1.
AB  - The assembly of pili on the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. In Streptococcus agalactiae, the PI-1 pilus island of strain 2603V/R encodes two pilus-specific sortases (SrtC1 and SrtC2) and three pilins (GBS80, GBS52 and GBS104). Although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, GBS80, incorporation of the minor pilins GBS52 and GBS104 into the pilus structure requires SrtC1 and SrtC2, respectively. The S. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, SrtA, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. To understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of S. agalactiae SrtC1 and SrtA. Both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. SrtA exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA but different from that in Staphylococcus aureus SrtA. In contrast, the SrtC1 enzyme contains an N-terminal helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that seen in Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. To understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a SrtC1 mutant, in which the conserved DP(W/F/Y) motif was replaced with the sorting signal motif of GBS80, IPNTG. By comparing the structures of WT wild type SrtA and SrtC1 and the 'lid' mutant of SrtC1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.
TI  - Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria in Makkah hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gram-positive bacteria are important nosocomial pathogens. The objective of this study was to estimate the frequencies and resistance rates of gram-positive pathogens isolated from hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study at three Makkah hospitals from May 2008 to April 2009. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical isolates were collected and demographic and laboratory data were recorded. Standard microbiological methods were used to identify the organisms and test for antimicrobial susceptibility. The results were interpreted according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Clinical isolates were collected from 1087 patients. Gram-positive pathogens infected all age groups, but had no gender predominance. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of wound infection and accounted for more than half of the clinical isolates (688 cases). Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS) was a common isolate from blood cultures. Wounds were the most common site of infection (37.6%). Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus agalactiae were the second most common bacteria (26%). The resistance rates of S aureus and CONS isolates were 39.4% and 82.4% for oxacillin, respectively. Among the streptococci, the resistance rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 21.1% and 16.7% for ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: S aureus infections were found to be very common in the Makkah hospitals. Infection prevention, control measures and continuous monitoring for antibiotic susceptibility are necessary to reduce these and other nosocomial infections.
TI  - Multiplex PCR and reverse line blot hybridization assay (mPCR/RLB).
AB  - Multiplex PCR/Reverse Line Blot Hybridization assay allows the detection of up to 43 molecular targets in 43 samples using one multiplex PCR reaction followed by probe hybridization on a nylon membrane, which is re-usable. Probes are 5' amine modified to allow fixation to the membrane. Primers are 5' biotin modified which allows detection of hybridized PCR products using streptavidin-peroxidase and a chemiluminescent substrate via photosensitive film. With low setup and consumable costs, this technique is inexpensive (approximately US$2 per sample), high throughput (multiple membranes can be processed simultaneously) and has a short turnaround time (approximately 10 hours). The technique can be utilized in a number of ways. Multiple probes can be designed to detect sequence variation within a single amplified product, or multiple products can be amplified simultaneously, with one (or more) probes used for subsequent detection. A combination of both approaches can also be used within a single assay. The ability to include multiple probes for a single target sequence makes the assay highly specific. Published applications of mPCR/RLB include detection of antibiotic resistance genes(1,2), typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(3-5) and Salmonella sp(6), molecular serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae(7,8), Streptococcus agalactiae(9) and enteroviruses(10,11), identification of Mycobacterium sp(12), detection of genital(13-15) and respiratory tract(16) and other(17) pathogens and detection and identification of mollicutes(18). However, the versatility of the technique means the applications are virtually limitless and not restricted to molecular analysis of micro-organisms. The five steps in mPCR/RLB are a) Primer and Probe design, b) DNA extraction and PCR amplification c) Preparation of the membrane, d) Hybridization and detection, and e) Regeneration of the Membrane.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Design of benzimidazole- and benzoxazole-2-thione derivatives as inhibitors of bacterial hyaluronan lyase.
AB  - Bacterial hyaluronan lyases (Hyal) degrade hyaluronan, an important component of  the extracellular matrix, and are involved in microbial spread. Hyal inhibitors may serve as tools to study the role of the enzyme, its substrates and products in the course of bacterial infections. Moreover, such enzyme inhibitors are potential candidates for antibacterial combination therapy. Based on crystal structures of Streptococcus pneumoniae Hyal in complex with a hexasaccharide substrate and with different inhibitors, 1-acylated benzimidazole-2-thiones and benzoxazole-2-thiones were derived as new leads for the inhibition of Streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 Hyal. Structure-based optimization led to N-(3-phenylpropionyl)benzoxazole-2-thione, one of the most potent compounds known to date (IC(50) values: 24 muM at pH 7.4, 15 muM at pH 5). Among the 27 new derivatives, other N-acylated benzimidazoles and benzoxazoles are just as active at pH 7.4, but not at pH 5. The results support a binding mode characterized by interactions with residues in the catalytic site and with a hydrophobic patch.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Incidence and severity of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus, and group B Streptococcus infections among pregnant and postpartum women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of streptococcal infection in pregnant and postpartum women is poorly described in recent literature. We used data from multistate surveillance for invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus (GAS), and group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections to estimate disease incidence and severity in these populations. METHODS: Cases were reported through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Active Bacterial Core surveillance, an active population- and laboratory-based system. A case was defined as illness in a woman aged 15-44 years with streptococcus isolated from a normally sterile body site during 2007-2009. Pregnant or postpartum status was recorded at the time of culture. Incidence was calculated as cases per 1000 woman-years with use of national Census data; 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of lambda distribution. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between pregnant or postpartum status and hospital length of stay, a marker of disease severity. RESULTS: We identified 1848 cases in women; 6.0% of women were pregnant, and 7.5% were postpartum. Pregnant women had a higher mean incidence of GBS disease, compared with nonpregnant women (0.04 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.03-0.05 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.02-0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years]). Postpartum women had elevated mean incidence of all 3 pathogens, compared with nonpregnant women (S. pneumoniae: 0.15 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.09-0.25 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.052 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.049-0.056 cases per 1000 woman-years]; GAS: 0.56 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.42-0.70 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.019 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.017-0.021 cases per 1000 woman-years]; GBS: 0.49 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.36-0.64 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.018 [range, 0.016-0.020 cases per 1000 woman-years]). Neither pregnancy nor postpartum status was associated with longer length of stay among women infected with any of the 3 pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Although invasive streptococcal infections do not appear to be more severe in pregnant or postpartum women, postpartum women have a 20-fold increased incidence of GAS and GBS, compared with nonpregnant women.
TI  - LEADER Program results for 2009: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using 6,414 clinical isolates from 56 medical centers in the United States.
AB  - The LEADER Program monitors the in vitro activity of linezolid in sampled U.S. medical centers using reference broth microdilution methods with supporting molecular investigations in a central laboratory design. This report summarizes data obtained in 2009, the 6th consecutive year of this longitudinal study. A total of 6,414 isolates from 56 medical centers in all nine Census regions across the United States participated in 2009. For the six leading species/groups, the following linezolid MIC(90) values were observed: Staphylococcus aureus, 2 mug/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 1 mug/ml; Enterococcus spp., 2 mug/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 mug/ml; viridans group streptococci, 1 mug/ml; and beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 mug/ml. Linezolid resistance was only 0.34% overall, with no evidence of significant increase in the LEADER Program since 2006. The predominant linezolid resistant mechanism found was a G2576T mutation in the 23S rRNA. L3/L4 riboprotein mutations were also found. The mobile multidrug-resistant cfr gene was found in four strains (two S. aureus strains and one strain each of S. epidermidis and S. capitis) from four different states, suggesting persistence but a lack of dissemination. Linezolid continues to exhibit excellent activity and spectrum, and this study documents the need for continued monitoring of emerging mechanisms of resistance over a wide geographic area.
TI  - Assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  - Despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. One key component of better control of this disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. Mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. Development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial DNA extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples to complement traditional microbiological identification. Extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. The following species were identified: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Klebsiella spp. (including Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The detection procedure includes specific genomic DNA amplification by multiplex PCR for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. The specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. The extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. The analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/mL for milk samples spiked with Staph. aureus, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli, with a tendency for K. pneumoniae. The detection limit was 500 cfu/mL for Strep. uberis and Strep. agalactiae. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. When the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, DNA purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. Of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive Staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16S sequencing. The proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated PCR detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.
TI  - Absence of pneumococcal PcsB is associated with overexpression of LysM domain-containing proteins.
AB  - The streptococcal protein required for cell separation B (PcsB) is predicted to play an important role in peptidoglycan metabolism, based on sequence motifs and altered phenotypes of gene deletion mutant cells exhibiting defects in cell separation. However, no enzymic activity has been demonstrated for PcsB so far. By generating gene deletion mutant strains in four different genetic backgrounds we could demonstrate that pcsB is not essential for cell survival in Streptococcus pneumoniae, but is essential for proper cell division. Deletion mutant cells displayed cluster formation due to aberrant cell division, reduced growth and antibiotic sensitivity that were fully reverted by transformation with a plasmid carrying pcsB. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that PcsB was localized to the cell poles, similarly to PBP3 and LytB, enzymes with demonstrated peptidoglycan-degrading activity required for daughter cell separation. Similarly to other studies with PcsB homologues, we could not detect peptidoglycan-lytic activity with recombinant or native pneumococcal PcsB in vitro. In addition to defects in septum placement and separation, the absence of PcsB induced an increased release of several proteins, such as enolase, MalX and the SP0107 LysM domain protein. Interestingly, genes encoding both LysM domain-containing proteins that are present in the pneumococcal genome (SP0107 and SP2063) and predicted to be involved in cell wall metabolism were found to be highly overexpressed (14-33-fold increase) in DeltapcsB cells in two different genetic backgrounds. Otherwise, we detected very few changes in the global gene expression profile of cells lacking PcsB. Thus our data suggest that LysM domain proteins partially compensate for the lack of PcsB function and allow the survival and slow growth of the pneumococcus.
TI  - Streptococcus
AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  - Etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in Korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent Korean children. We retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. A total of 768 cases were identified. S. agalactiae (48.1%) and S. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. S. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. S. pneumoniae (45.3%) and H. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr. S. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. S. aureus (50.6%), Salmonella species (16.9%), and S. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. A significant decline in H. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in Korean children.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - Cellular interactions by LPxTG-anchored pneumococcal adhesins and their streptococcal homologues.
AB  - In this review we focus on three important families of LPxTG-anchored adhesins in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also their homologues in related streptococci. We discuss the contribution of these streptococcal adhesins to host tropism, pathogenesis and their interactions with different host cell types. The first surface structures discussed are the heteropolymeric pili that have been found in important streptococcal pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and E. faecalis/faecium. Major and minor pilus subunit proteins are covalently joined and finally attached to the cell wall through the action of specific sortases. The role of pili and individual pilin subunits in adhesion and pathogenesis and their structure and assembly in different streptococcal species are being covered. Furthermore, we address recent findings regarding a family of large glycosylated serine-rich repeat (SRR) proteins that act as fibrillar adhesins for which homologues have been found in several streptococcal species including pneumococci. In the pneumococcal genome both pili and its giant SRR protein are encoded by accessory genes present in particular clonal lineages for which epidemiological information is available. Finally, we briefly discuss the role played by the pneumococcal neuraminidase NanA in adhesion and pathogenesis.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae endocarditis on replacement aortic valve with panopthalmitis and pseudoabscess.
AB  - A 63-year-old woman with a previous episode of Streptococcus agalactiae endocarditis requiring a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement presented with a short history of malaise, a right panopthalmitis with a Roth spot on funduscopy of the left eye and Streptococcus pneumoniae grown from vitreous and aqueous taps as well as blood cultures. She developed first degree heart block and her ECG was suggestive of an aortic root abscess. This gradually resolved over 6 weeks, during which she was treated with intravenous antibiotics. After careful consideration, it is likely that what was thought to be an aortic root abscess was instead an area of perivalvular inflammation.
TI  - Bacterial pore-forming cytolysins induce neuronal damage in a rat model of neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) are leading causes of bacterial meningitis in neonates and children. Each pathogen produces a pore-forming cytolytic toxin, beta-hemolysin/cytolysin (beta-h/c) by GBS and pneumolysin by SP. The aim of this study was to understand the role of these pore-forming cytotoxins, in particular of the GBS beta-h/c, as potential neurotoxins in experimental neonatal meningitis. METHODS: Meningitis was induced in 7- and 11-day-old rats by intracisternal injection of wild type (WT) GBS or SP and compared with isogenic beta-h/c- or pneumolysin-deficient mutants, or a double mutant of SP deficient in pneumolysin and hydrogen peroxide production. RESULTS: GBS beta-h/c and SP pneumolysin contributed to neuronal damage, worsened clinical outcome and weight loss, but had no influence on the early kinetics of leukocyte influx and bacterial growth in the cerebrospinal fluid. In vitro, beta-h/c-induced neuronal apoptosis occurred independently of caspase-activation and was not preventable by the broad spectrum caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that both cytolytic toxins, the GBS beta-h/c and SP pneumolysin, contribute to neuronal damage in meningitis and extend the concept of a key role for bacterial pore-forming cytolysins in the pathogenesis and sequelae of neonatal meningitis.

TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - Autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide bond formation in gram-positive bacterial pili: a QM/MM simulation.
AB  - Many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. Unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between Asn and Lys side chains within the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the Streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit Spy0128 and subsequently in GBS52 from Streptococcus agalactiae, in the BcpA major pilin of Bacillus cereus and in the RrgB pilin of Streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. Within each pilin subunit, intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. These bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. Genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. For the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including Asn, Lys, and a catalytically important acidic Glu (or Asp) residue are responsible. However, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. Although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as Spy0128 and RrgB. This suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. From this mechanistic perspective, we used the QM/MM minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with Spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. It was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on Cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated Lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia. More importantly, within the dual active sites of Spy0128, Glu(117), and Glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. This work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within Spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. Our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Genomic organization, structure, regulation and pathogenic role of pilus constituents in major pathogenic Streptococci and Enterococci.
AB  - Oligocomponent pilus structures, recently discovered in many important Gram-positive pathogens, represent a new class of virulence factors with adhesive and matrix protein-binding activity. Some of these proteins have emerged as very promising lead components of protein-based vaccines against Streptococci. These extended surface structures play key roles in host cell and tissue adherence, paracellular translocation, and biofilm formation of major Gram-positive pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae as well as in opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens like Enterococci. Here, we discuss the similarities and differences of: (1) the genomic organization of the various regions encoding pilus proteins, (2) the number, type, and assembly of the proteins constituting the pili, (3) their expression and regulation mechanisms, (4) their role in bacterial virulence, and (5) their potential as vaccine candidate antigens.
TI  - Etiology and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of community- and hospital-acquired urinary tract infections in a general hospital in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the bacterial profile and prevalence of antibiotic resistance patterns of uropathogens, as well as evaluate the problem with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing isolates, causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Al-Amiri Hospital, Kuwait, over a 3-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolates (56,505) from symptomatic UTI cases from January 2005 to December 2007 were identified by conventional methods and the VITEK identification card system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method for Gram-positive organisms and an automated VITEK 2 machine for Gram-negative organisms. ESBL production by the Enterobacteriaceae was detected by the double-disk diffusion method and VITEK-2 system. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was detected in 15,064 (26.6%) of the 56,505 urine samples. Escherichia coli accounted for 4,876 (54.9%) from community-acquired UTI (CA-UTI) and 2,253 (36.4%) from hospital-acquired UTI (HA-UTI), followed by Streptococcus agalactiae (1,129, 12.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (962, 10.8%) from CA-UTI cases. Candida spp. (973, 15.7%) and K. pneumoniae (747, 12.1%) were the second and third most prevalent isolates, respectively, in HA-UTI. High resistance rates were observed among the Enterobacteriaceae against ampicillin, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. About 855 (12%) and 291 (17%) of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively, were resistant to >/=4 antibiotics. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in CA-UTI was 12 and 17% and in HA-UTI 26 and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of the uropathogens causing UTI in the Al-Amiri Hospital setting was highly resistant to the first- and second-line antibiotics for the therapy of UTI. ESBL-producing bacteria are highly prevalent in our hospital.
TI  - Novel plasmid-based genetic tools for the study of promoters and terminators in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Promoter-probe and terminator-probe plasmid vectors make possible to rapidly examine whether particular sequences function as promoter or terminator signals in various genetic backgrounds and under diverse environmental stimuli. At present, such plasmid-based genetic tools are very scarce in the Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Hence, we developed novel promoter-probe and terminator-probe vectors based on the Streptococcus agalactiae pMV158 plasmid, which replicates autonomously in numerous Gram-positive bacteria. As reporter gene, a gfp allele encoding a variant of the green fluorescent protein was used. These genetic tools were shown to be suitable to assess the activity of promoters and terminators (both homologous and heterologous) in S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis. In addition, the promoter-probe vector was shown to be a valuable tool for the analysis of regulated promoters in vivo, such as the promoter of the pneumococcal fuculose kinase gene. These new plasmid vectors will be very useful for the experimental verification of predicted promoter and terminator sequences, as well as for the construction of new inducible-expression vectors. Given the promiscuity exhibited by the pMV158 replicon, these vectors could be used in a variety of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Structure determination of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was isolated,  purified, chemically modified, and characterized. Sugar and absolute configuration analyses of the CPS gave the following composition: D-Gal, 3; D-Glc, 1; D-GlcNAc, 1; D-Neu5Ac, 1; L-Rha, 1. Sialic acid was found to be terminal, and the CPS was quantitatively desialylated by mild acid hydrolysis. The CPS was also submitted to periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and Smith degradation. Sugar and methylation analysis, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry of the native CPS or of its specifically modified products allowed to determine the repeating unit sequence: [4)[Neu5Ac(alpha2-6)Gal(beta1-4)GlcNAc(beta1-3)]Gal(beta1-4)[Gal(alpha1-3)]Rha(be ta1-4)Glc(beta1-]n. The backbone sequence was found to be identical to that of Streptococcus agalactiae or group B Streptococcus (GBS) type VIII and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 23F. The S. suis CPS shares the sequence Neu5Ac-Gal-GlcNAc-Gal in common with GBS types Ia, Ib, II, III, and IV CPSs but differs from them by the presence of rhamnose and the fact that sialic acid is 2,6- rather than 2,3-linked to the following Gal. A correlation between the S. suis CPS sequence and genes of the serotype 2 cps locus encoding putative enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit was tentatively established.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The activity of ceftobiprole and comparator agents was evaluated against a collection of 880 isolates, comprising 200 meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 200 meticillin-resistant S. aureus, 180 coagulase-negative staphylococci blood isolates, 100 Streptococcuspneumoniae and 200 macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci (100 Streptococcus pyogenes and 100 Streptococcus agalactiae). Ceftobiprole showed excellent activity against staphylococci (minimum inhibitory concentrations <or=4 microg/mL), irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents such as oxacillin, linezolid or glycopeptides. Ceftobiprole was also highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci, inhibiting 99.6% of all streptococci tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. Based on these results, ceftobiprole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - The causative organisms of bacterial meningitis in Korean children in 1996-2005.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis remains a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood, despite the availability of effective vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The purpose of this study was to analyze data on bacterial meningitis cases in Korea from 1996 through 2005. The information of all hospitalized bacteria-proven meningitis cases was obtained from 17 university hospitals nationwide. A total of 402 cases were identified. Of these, 125 (29.9%) cases were neonates. Streptococcus agalactiae was the most common bacteria responsible for 99 (24.6%) of all cases regardless of age, followed by S. pneumoniae for 91 (22.6%) and H. influenzae for 67 (16.7%) patients. The common etiology beyond the neonatal period was S. pneumoniae for 91 (33.0%) followed by H. influenzae for 63 (22.8%) patients. The overall case fatality rate was 9.4%, which was similar with that in 1986-1995. In conclusion, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were important etiologic agents of bacterial meningitis in children in the last 10 yrs. It is required to establish the preventive strategy of the three bacteria. The nationwide epidemiologic study should be continued to evaluate immunization strategy and efficacy.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the tet (M)-carrying conjugative transposon Tn5251 of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The Tn916-like genetic element Tn5251 is part of the composite conjugative transposon (CTn) Tn5253 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a 64.5-kb chromosomal element originally called Omega(cat-tet) BM6001. DNA sequence analysis showed that Tn5251 is 18 033-bp long and contains 22 ORFs, 20 of which have the same direction of transcription. Annotation was possible for 11 out of 22 ORFs, including the tet(M) tetracycline resistance gene and int and xis involved in the integration/excision process. Autonomous copies of Tn5251 were generated during matings of Tn5253-containing donors with S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Tn5251 was shown to integrate at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. It behaves as a fully functional CTn capable of independent conjugal transfer to a variety of bacterial species including S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. The excision of Tn5251 produces a circular intermediate and a deletion in Tn5253 at a level of 1.2 copies per 10(5) chromosomes.
TI  - [Recombinant fragments of conservative proteins of group B streptococci as a basis of specific vaccine].
AB  - AIM: The study devoted to problem of using of recombinant fragments of group B streptococci (GBS) conservative proteins for induction of immune response against streptococcal infections. Two recombinant polypeptides (ScaAB and-ScpB1) corresponding to immunogenic epitopes of two surface GBS proteins ScaAB and C5a-peptidase, which are presented in other streptococcal species, were studied. The objective of the study was to assess specificity and protective activity of mentioned polypeptides against homologous and heterologous strains of pathogenic streptococci from different groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae were used in the study. Array of used methods included opsonophagocytic test as well as active and passive protection of experimental animals against streptococcal infection. RESULTS: It was shown that antibodies specific to studied polypeptides opsonized several strains of group A and B streptococci as well as pneumococci. Immunization of mice with ScpB1 polypeptide resulted in more rapid recovery of animals from challenge systemic group B streptococcal infection. Antisera specific to both polypeptides provided passive protection of animals from infection caused either GBS or GAS. CONCLUSION: Obtained data confirm the feasibility to use recombinant fragments of several GBS conservative proteins in vaccine for induction of protection against infections caused by different species of pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (BM). BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. Despite its high mortality rate, BM has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. STUDY: BM patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and 2008, were studied. BM was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in CSF. RESULTS: We identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had BM. The mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. Abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. The sensitivity of CSF culture was 75% (Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; Staphylococcus aureus, 2; Listeria monocytogenes, 1; Group B Streptococcus, 1; Streptococcus agalactiae, 1; Streptococcus bovis, 1; and Escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. Five patients died. On admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dL. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL was associated with increased mortality (P=0.028). The model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dL, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of CSF were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BM in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. The clinical and microbiologic features of BM in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. A serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dL on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Epidemiology of pediatric community-acquired bloodstream infections in a children hospital in Paris, France, 2001 to 2008.
AB  - In 2001 to 2008, we documented 483 cases of pediatric community-acquired bacteremia mostly because of Streptococcus agalactiae (< 4 days), Escherichia coli (4 days to 3 months), pneumococci (3 months to 5 years), and Staphylococcus aureus (> 5 years). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination affected the serotype distribution of pneumococcal bacteremia but not its frequency. Serotype 19A represented 12% and 22% of pneumococci in the prevaccine and vaccine periods, respectively.
TI  - Evaluation, management, and outcome of focal bacterial infections (FBIs) in nontoxic infants under two months of age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Well-appearing young infants with focal bacterial infections present  to the emergency department (ED) and are often admitted for a sepsis evaluation of blood, urine, and spinal fluid. However, the risk of concomitant systemic infections (CSI) in this population is not well reported, specifically comparing febrile to afebrile infants. We hypothesized that afebrile, well-appearing infants under two months of age with a defined focal bacterial infection on exam have a very low risk of CSI. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at an urban, academic, tertiary care pediatric hospital ED on patients seen from January 2000-December 2005. Eligible infants were less than 60 days of age, well-appearing on exam, and with normal-for-age vital signs who presented with a focal bacterial infection on exam. Exclusion criteria included immunodeficiency, indwelling catheter, previous admission for bacterial infection, or current use of systemic antibiotics. Main study outcome was risk of CSI in febrile and afebrile groups. RESULTS: One hundred ninety seven patients were included in the study population. Of these, 39 were febrile and 158 were afebrile. Four patients had a documented CSI: one case of S. pneumoniae bacteremia and three cases of E. coli urinary tract infection. Of these 4 infants, 3 were febrile (7.7% CSI risk) and 1 was afebrile (0.6%). Febrile infants had a significantly higher risk of CSI (OR 13.1, 95% CI 1.3, 129.5). CONCLUSIONS: CSI is very uncommon in afebrile, well-appearing infants under 60 days of age with a focal bacterial infection.
TI  - Mechanisms of meningeal invasion by a bacterial extracellular pathogen, the example of Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. A few bacterial pathogens are able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans, a rare but dreadful disease. Surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae). The particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-CSF barrier. In vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. agalactiae to reach the CSF. N. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. Adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type IV pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. Recent work has shown that N. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex Par3/Par6/aPKC that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of quinolones against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin (LVFX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), norfloxacin (NFLX), prulifloxacin (PUFX), and tosufloxacin (TFLX) using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from clinical materials. Based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area under the curve (AUC)/MIC of 120 or more for Gram-negative and 30 or more for Gram-positive bacteria was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and was assessed as the efficacy. GRNX showed the lowest MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against S. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. GRNX also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, MSSA) other than S. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of CPFX against H. influenzae was most potent. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of the other agents were also favorable. PUFX showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Both of MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. On efficacy assessment using MCS, GRNX, GFLX, and MFLX showed a probability of 90% or more against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Against S. agalactiae, GRNX, MFLX, and GFLX showed a probability of approximately 60%. All agents showed a low probability against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; PUFX showed a maximum (43.63%). GRNX, MFLX, GFLX, and LVFX showed a probability of 90% or more against MSSA. Furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance inhibition, an AUC/MIC of more than 200 against S. pneumoniae, is achieved. GRNX showed the highest probability (95.05%). It also exhibited a similar probability even when the target value was established as 250. Recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. In the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Toll-like receptors in bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis is still an important infectious disease with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Bacterial infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space causes a powerful inflammatory reaction that is largely responsibly for meningitis-induced tissue damage and adverse outcome of the disease. In a landmark series of experiments in the mid-1980s, cell wall components including lipooligosaccharides and lipoteichoic acid were indicated to be the key bacterial elements that can trigger the host inflammatory response in the CSF. Ten years ago, the discovery of Toll-like receptor proteins (TLRs) that allow the detection of microbial components and initiate the host immune response opened up new horizons in research on the pathophysiology of meningitis. Cell culture approaches provided the first evidence for a crucial role of TLRs in sensing meningeal pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Listeria monocytogenes. Subsequently, studies in mice with single or combined deficiencies in TLRs demonstrated that TLR activation is a key event in meningeal inflammation and, even more interestingly, a pivotal factor for meningitis-associated tissue damage. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in the CSF space may generate new opportunities for specific treatment strategies for bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Clinical significance of cerebrospinal fluid inhibitory titers of antibiotics, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inhibitory titer (CSF-IT) of an antibiotic, which can be used to estimate the duration of time above the agent's MIC in the CSF, was introduced as one of the indices to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic selection in treating bacterial meningitis. The CSF-IT was determined via a microdilution method. A suspension of the causative organism was added to a tube containing twofold diluted CSF and double-concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth with supplement. The CSF-IT was determined by the maximum point without turbidity of medium after overnight incubation at 37 degrees C. Concerning the strain of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR), the killing rates of both meropenem and piperacillin were compared in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) model, in which human pharmacokinetics in CSF were simulated. Organisms recovered from the CSF in 37 treated clinical cases of bacterial meningitis were H. influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria meningitidis; in these cases, the CSF-IT ranged from 1: 8 to as high as 1: 4 096. In the in vitro PK model, the concentrations of both drugs were higher than the MICs over a period of 24 h; however, the killing rate of piperacillin was higher than that of meropenem, and bacterial regrowth was observed after the administration of meropenem. A CSF-IT value higher than 1: 32 indicates that the antibiotic concentration in the CSF exceeds the MIC for 24 h. The effect of piperacillin on BLNAR depends not only on the time above MIC of 24 h but also on the maximum concentration in the CSF.
TI  - Screening of binding activity of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis to berries and juices.
AB  - Antiadhesion therapy is a promising approach to the fight against pathogens. Antibiotic resistance and the lack of effective vaccines have increased the search for new methods to prevent infectious diseases. Previous studies have shown the antiadhesion activity of juice from cultivated cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) against bacteria, especially E. coli. In this study, the binding of two streptococcal strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, to molecular size fractions (FI, FII and FIII, <10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, and >100 kDa, respectively) of berries and berry and fruit juices from 12 plant species were studied using a microtiter well assay. For Streptococcus suis a hemagglutination inhibition assay was used. In general, binding activity was detected especially to wild cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos L.) and to other Vaccinium species. S. pneumoniae cells bound most to cranberry juice fraction FI and S. agalactiae cells to cranberry fraction FIII. Hemagglutination induced by S. suis was most effectively inhibited by cranberry fraction FII. NMR spectra of some characteristic active and non-active fractions were also measured. They indicate that fractions FII and FIII contained proanthocyanidins and/or other phenolic compounds. The results suggest Vaccinium berries as possible sources of antiadhesives against bacterial infections.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  - Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. Here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal UGLs and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. The putative genes for UGL and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. The UGLs of these three streptococci were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. Streptococcal UGLs degraded unsaturated hyaluronate and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. Distinct from Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL, streptococcal UGLs preferred sulfated substrates. DNA microarray and Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in S. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) was determined at 1.75 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. SagUGL adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to Bacillus UGL, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. SagUGL Arg-236 was found to be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal UGLs.
TI  - Rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time PCR.
AB  - We aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000). In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.
TI  - [Epidemiology of acute bacterial meningitis in adult patients in France].
AB  - In 2006, the number of bacterial meningitis cases was estimated at 1375 (2.23/100,000). The leading pathogens involved in adult meningitis were, according to frequency, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The overall mortality rate averaged 20%, higher among patients with pneumococcal meningitis or in individuals over 65 years of age. Sequels were observed in 30% of cases and more frequent after pneumococcal meningitis. A decrease in susceptibility to antibiotics was reported for N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Generalized vaccination of children less than two years of age with H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has lead to a dramatic decrease in adult H. influenza meningitis. The few cases involved almost exclusively non-typeable strains, presenting in 12% of cases, a modified penicillin binding protein leading to a decreased susceptibility to aminopenicillins. Decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin was observed in 30% of meningococcal isolates, but all strains remained susceptible to parenteral third generation cephalosporins. Resistances to rifampicin or to ciprofloxacin, recommended in meningococcal meningitis prophylaxis, were unusual, but had to be documented. Finally, the proportion of pneumococcal strains with decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams has decreased since 2002. In adult meningitis, pneumococcal isolates with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin, and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone accounted for 37, 18, and 4% of cases respectively. It should be noted that for these isolates, no parenteral third generation cephalosporins MIC was above 2mg/l. Resistance to rifampin was very unusual and all pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to glycopeptides.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Eight-plex PCR and liquid-array detection of bacterial and viral pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected meningitis.
AB  - We here report on the development of a novel multiplex PCR with product detection in a Luminex 100 suspension array system. The assay covers the nine most important bacterial and viral pathogens found in Danish meningitis patients. The microorganisms include Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and varicella-zoster virus. The study was based on 1,187 samples, of which 55 were found to be positive by PCR. The assay was found to have an excellent sensitivity and an excellent specificity compared to the results of a "gold standard," defined by routine laboratory tests, for the two most important pathogens, S. pneumoniae (95 and 99.1%, respectively) and N. meningitidis (100 and 99.7%, respectively). The method provides a valuable supplement to the traditional microscopy and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in a routine diagnostic setting, and results can be available within 1 workday. The method is suitable for use for the initial screening and identification of nine important microorganisms in CSF samples from patients with suspected meningitis. Compared to microscopy and culture of CSF, this rapid and sensitive method will support physicians with the selection of the appropriate antimicrobial agents and the initiation of timely treatment in the absence of live microorganisms in the CSF.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - The prevalence of erythromycin resistance in group B streptococcal isolates at a  University Hospital in Taiwan.
AB  - Due to reduced antibiotic consumption in Taiwan, erythromycin resistance rate had decreased in Streptococcus pyogenes, but it increased in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The objectives of the present study were (1) to determine the erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rate and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the group B streptococcus (GBS) clinical isolates, and (2) to investigate the mechanism responsible for the macrolide, lincosamide, and group B streptogramin (MLS(B)) resistance. A total of 1,395 GBS isolates were collected from June 2001 to April 2007. Forty-four percent of the GBS isolates were resistant to erythromycin, and 39% were resistant to clindamycin. The annual erythromycin resistance rate increased from 32% in 2001 to 51% in 2004; a significant decrease was observed in 2005 (47%), 2006 (42%), and 2007 (38%). Percentage of erythromycin-resistant isolates with erm(B) gene significantly increased from 72% in 2001 to 90% in 2007. We found that the plasmid encoded zeta gene was present in 13% of the resistant isolates, along with erm(B). When compared to our previous study (1991 to May 2001), the overall erythromycin resistance rate increased from 30% to 44%. erm(B) was the major resistant determinant, and zeta toxin encoding plasmid has a limited role in mediating erythromycin resistance unlike in GAS isolates as reported earlier.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus gordonii prophage PH15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii OMZ1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, PH15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. Phage PH15 belongs to the Siphoviridae. The complete genome sequence of PH15 was determined. The genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 ORFs. The genome of PH15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages MM1 and phiNIH1.1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. In strain OMZ1039, PH15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-tRNA gene. A plasmid, harbouring the attP site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. The phage endolysin was purified after expression in Escherichia coli and found to inhibit growth of all S. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - The role of complex carbohydrate catabolism in the pathogenesis of invasive streptococci.
AB  - Historically, the study of bacterial catabolism of complex carbohydrates has contributed to understanding basic bacterial physiology. Recently, however, genome-wide screens of streptococcal pathogenesis have identified genes encoding proteins involved in complex carbohydrate catabolism as participating in pathogen infectivity. Subsequent studies have focused on specific mechanisms by which carbohydrate utilization proteins might contribute to the ability of streptococci to colonize and infect the host. Moreover, transcriptome and biochemical analyses have uncovered novel regulatory pathways by which streptococci link environmental carbohydrate availability to virulence factor production. Herein we review new insights into the role of complex carbohydrates in streptococcal host-pathogen interaction.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - [Lipoteichoic and teichoic acids of pathogenic streptococci: structure, functions, and role in interaction of the infectious agent with organism].
AB  - Features of structure, localization, and function of teichoic (TA) and lipoteichoic acids (LPA) of gram-positive bacteria are shortly characterized. Structures of polymers obtained from Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae are described. The role of TA and LPA of pathogenic streptococci in different phases of infectious process and requirements for biological activity of these molecules are discussed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Tigecycline in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected in Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study (part of the global TEST program), the in vitro activity of tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the glycylcyclines, against clinical isolates collected in Italy was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 200 clinical isolates were collected and identified in our institution during 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method recommended by the CLSI in 2005. RESULTS: Globally, 135 Gram-negative and 65 Gram-positive pathogens were evaluated. Tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC(90) <or=1 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity (comparable to or greater than most commonly employed antimicrobials) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens. These data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective empiric therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 prophage lysins of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Putative N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase genes from LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 prophages of Streptococcus agalactiae were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes lysed the cell walls of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptidoglycan digestion products in the cell wall lysates were not consistent with amidase activity. Instead, the structure of the muropeptide digestion fragments indicated that both the LambdaSa1 and LambdaSa2 lysins exhibited gamma-d-glutaminyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity. The endopeptidase cleavage specificity of the lysins was confirmed using a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to a portion of the stem peptide and cross bridge of Streptococcus agalactiae peptidoglycan. The LambdaSa2 lysin also displayed beta-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity.
TI  - Genetic relatedness of the Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular biosynthetic loci.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) produces 1 of 91 capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that define the serotype. The cps loci of 88 pneumococcal serotypes whose CPS is synthesized by the Wzy-dependent pathway were compared with each other and with additional streptococcal polysaccharide biosynthetic loci and were clustered according to the proportion of shared homology groups (HGs), weighted for the sequence similarities between the genes encoding the shared HGs. The cps loci of the 88 pneumococcal serotypes were distributed into eight major clusters and 21 subclusters. All serotypes within the same serogroup fell into the same major cluster, but in six cases, serotypes within the same serogroup were in different subclusters and, conversely, nine subclusters included completely different serotypes. The closely related cps loci within a subcluster were compared to the known CPS structures to relate gene content to structure. The Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mitis polysaccharide biosynthetic loci clustered within the pneumococcal cps loci and were in a subcluster that also included the cps locus of pneumococcal serotype 21, whereas the Streptococcus agalactiae cps loci formed a single cluster that was not closely related to any of the pneumococcal cps clusters.
TI  - Comparative genomic analyses of seventeen Streptococcus pneumoniae strains: insights into the pneumococcal supragenome.
AB  - The distributed-genome hypothesis (DGH) states that pathogenic bacteria possess a supragenome that is much larger than the genome of any single bacterium and that these pathogens utilize genetic recombination and a large, noncore set of genes as a means of diversity generation. We sequenced the genomes of eight nasopharyngeal strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from pediatric patients with upper respiratory symptoms and performed quantitative genomic analyses among these and nine publicly available pneumococcal strains. Coding sequences from all strains were grouped into 3,170 orthologous gene clusters, of which 1,454 (46%) were conserved among all 17 strains. The majority of the gene clusters, 1,716 (54%), were not found in all strains. Genic differences per strain pair ranged from 35 to 629 orthologous clusters, with each strain's genome containing between 21 and 32% noncore genes. The distribution of the orthologous clusters per genome for the 17 strains was entered into the finite-supragenome model, which predicted that (i) the S. pneumoniae supragenome contains more than 5,000 orthologous clusters and (ii) 99% of the orthologous clusters ( approximately 3,000) that are represented in the S. pneumoniae population at frequencies of >or=0.1 can be identified if 33 representative genomes are sequenced. These extensive genic diversity data support the DGH and provide a basis for understanding the great differences in clinical phenotype associated with various pneumococcal strains. When these findings are taken together with previous studies that demonstrated the presence of a supragenome for Streptococcus agalactiae and Haemophilus influenzae, it appears that the possession of a distributed genome is a common host interaction strategy.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates recently  obtained in Europe.
AB  - The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 620 gram-positive isolates. For staphylococci, MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were both 0.25 microg/ml, irrespective of methicillin resistance. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml for vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and 1 and 2 microg/ml for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci were inhibited by < or =0.12 microg/ml.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - A composite transposon associated with erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin has been isolated with increasing frequency since the mid-1990s. This work studied GBS isolates from three US cities to determine the genetic basis of the macrolide resistance phenotype. ermB genes were amplified from five isolates collected in Boston, Pittsburgh and Seattle from infant and adult sources. Gene-walking methods were used to determine the chromosomal location of ermB and to identify associated genes. Southern mapping and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses were used to distinguish the isolates. The ermB gene was present on the chromosome within a composite Tn917/Tn916-like transposon similar to one identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Four strains from Boston and Pittsburgh were serotype V and identical by Southern hybridization and RAPD analysis. The Seattle isolate was serotype Ib, with different patterns on RAPD analysis and Southern mapping. The composite transposon was integrated at an identical chromosomal site in all five isolates. The presence of this composite transposon in both GBS and pneumococci suggests that ermB-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci may be due to the horizontal transfer of a mobile transposable element, and raises concern for further dissemination of high-grade erythromycin and clindamycin resistance among streptococcal species.
TI  - Klebsiella pneumoniae in neonatal sepsis: a 3-year-study in the pediatric hospital of Tabriz, Iran.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a life-threatening emergency, and any delay in treatment may cause death. Because of the importance of the problem in Iran, the aim of this retrospective study was to determine the etiological agents of neonatal septicemia, and the prevalence and epidemiology of Klebsiella bacteremia in the neonatal wards. Two hundred and ten cases of neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. The most common organism was coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 66 cases (31.43%), and the most common Gram-negative organism causing neonatal sepsis was Klebsiella pneumoniae. The mortality rate due to Gram-negative bacteria including K. pneumoniae was higher than that due to other bacteria. The distribution of the main pathogens is different in the Azerbaijan state, northwest of Iran, and K. pneumoniae is predominant, but Streptococcus agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - Albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. Albomycin was found to be active against bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. We examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that Enterobacteriaceae except species of Proteus and Morganella were sensitive. Resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. The in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Yersinia enterocolitica. A single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of Y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. A single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear S. pneumoniae infections in mice. In direct competition experiments with wild-type S. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. We conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a mouse model. Albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. The ferrichrome transport system serves as a Trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of antimicrobial and bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects of macrolides antibiotics against clinical isolates, and examination of shape alteration by scanning electron microscope].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides (MLs), erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 4 bacterial species of clinical strains isolated in 2004. Bacterial isolates used were 51 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 20 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 68 of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 120 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrolide resistance genes, ermB and mefE, in macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, and all of pneumococci were analyzed by PCR. Antimicrobial activities against macrolide-susceptible MSSA of EM and CAM, were more potent than those of RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than EM, CAM and AZM. Against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, 4 antibiotics showed similar antimicrobial activities. Twelve, 1 and 2 strains of MSSA, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to EM, CAM and AZM, whereas RKM was active to almost, but not quite, of them. Among 120 strains of S. pneumoniae, 76 (63.3%) were resistant to EM (MIC; > or = 0.5 microg/mL), and 23, 15 and 28 strains were highly resistant (MIC; > 128 microg/mL) to EM, CAM and AZM, respectively. By contrast, for RKM, there were far fewer resistant strains, and there was no highly resistant strain. PCR analyses of macrolide-resistant genes revealed that 1 resistant strain of S. pyogenes and 2 of S. agalactiae carried mefE and ermB, respectively. In the case of S. pneumoniae, 59, 19 and 5 strains, respectively, carried ermB, mefE and both ermB and mefe. We also studied about bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAE) of MLs using macrolide-susceptible, and ermB- and mefE-carrying S. pneumoniae, and observed morphological alterations of the strains treated with the drugs by a scanning electron microscope. It was demonstrated that RKM had superior bactericidal activities and PAE than other 3 drugs, and potent destructive effects to all of 3 strains.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils was evaluated on Vero cells. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens. The antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was examined. Some oils showed inhibition of bacterial growth against most of the organisms examined. Cinnamon and thyme showed the strongest action followed by clove. The results reported in this paper indicate that thyme can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of some respiratory tract infections in man.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new plasmid pSpnP1 from a multidrug-resistant clone of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A novel Streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pSpnP1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone Poland(23F)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. Sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pSpnP1 is different to pDP1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pSt08, a plasmid from Streptococcus thermophilus. A double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pC194/pUB110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). It also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type A of the Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pMV158/pLS1. Detection of single-stranded DNA by Southern blot analysis indicated that pSpnP1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. Interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative Zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae. Real-time PCR assays revealed that this ORF was expressed. Hybridization experiments showed that the pSpnP1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pSpnP1 were able to replicate in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Role of ionic interactions and linker in the domain interaction and modulation of functional activity of hyaluronate lyases.
AB  - Hyaluronate lyases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpnHL) and Streptococcus agalactiae (SagHL) are composed of four domains; N-terminal domain, spacer domain, alpha-domain and C-terminal domain, which are connected through peptide linkers. We have earlier shown that the recombinant alpha- and C-terminal domains of SpnHL/SagHL interact with each other even in absence of the linker and form a functional complex with enhanced enzymatic activity. Here, we looked into the role of ionic interactions in the enzyme stability and also the role of C-terminal domain and linker in the functional regulation. Domain swapping studies showed that the C-terminal domain does not bind directly to the substrate; instead the domain contributes to the interaction with the polymeric hyaluronan for catalysis. Furthermore, the substrate specificity exchanges with the size of catalytic cleft. The role of linker connecting alpha-domain to C-terminal domain was found to hold the C-terminal domain in a conformation suitable for achieving maximum activity.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Toll-like receptor-dependent discrimination of streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae cause distinct infectious diseases in small children. Similarly, these bacteria elicit very different host-cell responses in vitro. Inactivated S. agalactiae by far exceeds S. pneumoniae in the activation of inflammatory cytokines and upstream signaling intermediates such as the MAP kinase JNK. The inflammatory response to both Streptococcus spp. is mediated by MyD88, an essential adapter protein of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), although the specific TLRs that are involved have not been fully resolved. Furthermore, during logarithmic growth, S. pneumoniae releases pneumolysin that interacts with TLR4 whereas S. agalactiae releases diacylated molecules that interact with TLR2/6. Interaction of these soluble bacterial products with their cognate TLRs is critical for limiting bacterial dissemination and and systemic inflammation in mice. This might be due, in part, to TLR-mediated apoptosis induced by these factors. In conclusion related streptococcal species induce specific events in TLR-mediated signal transduction. Comparative analysis of the host-cell response to these bacteria reveals molecules such as JNK as valuable targets for adjunctive sepsis therapy.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Adjacent location of the bac gene and two-component regulatory system genes within the putative Streptococcus agalactiae pathogenicity island.
AB  - A chromosomal DNA fragment of 8992 bp in size that has not been previously identified in Streptococcus agalactiae, was cloned and sequenced from strain 98-D60C. In particular, this 8992-bp fragment contained genes homologous to the sensor histidine kinase gene and the DNA-binding response-regulator gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae bac gene. Structural and genetic features of the 8992-bp fragment were highly similar to those specific for bacterial pathogenicity islands. Analysis of epidemiologically unrelated S. agalactiae strains revealed that this fragment was present only in bac gene-positive strains. The possible origin of the 8992-bp fragment in S. agalactiae and its significance for molecular mechanisms of "bacteria-host" interactions are discussed.
TI  - Gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  - Bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a predominant force in bacterial evolution. To better understand the significance of LGT, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal genomes using a maximum likelihood method. This study indicates that the rate of gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each species. We have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by LGT and conclude that at least a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.
TI  - DNA methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  - Recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (Tn1207.3 and Phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]). The dissemination of elements belonging to the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of GAS, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae recovered in Portugal was surveyed. In total, 149 GAS, 18 S. pneumoniae, 4 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 S. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the M phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 by PCR targeting open reading frames (ORFs) specific for these related elements. All the GAS isolates tested and one of the S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried Tn1207.3. However, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. It was also noted that the DNAs of the isolates carrying Tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease SmaI. Cloning and expression of ORF12 of Tn1207.3 in Escherichia coli showed that it encoded a methyltransferase that rendered DNA refractory to cleavage by SmaI (M.Spy10394I). Using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible GAS isolates presenting the M phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.
TI  - Novel 6-O-acylated vitamin C derivatives as hyaluronidase inhibitors with selectivity for bacterial lyases.
AB  - Previously, we identified ascorbic acid 6-O-hexadecanoate as an up to 1500 times  more potent inhibitor of bacterial and bovine hyaluronidases than the parent compound, vitamin C, and determined a crystal structure of hyaluronidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae in complex with the inhibitor. As the alkanoyl chain interacts with a hydrophobic patch of the enzyme we synthesized other 6-O-acylated vitamin C derivatives bearing various lipophilic residues and investigated the inhibition of Streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hyaluronidase (SagHyal(4755)) and of bovine testicular hyaluronidases (BTH) in a turbidimetric assay. All compounds showed selectivity for the bacterial enzyme. Whereas vitamin C 6-O-hexanoate only weakly inhibited SagHyal(4755), the inhibition of both enzymes increased with the length of the aliphatic chain. In the case of the 6-O-octadecanoate, IC(50) values of 0.9 and 39microM for SagHyal(4755) and BTH, respectively, were determined. Partial replacement of the aliphatic chain with a phenyl, p-phenylene or p-biphenylyl group resulted in inhibitors with activity in the lower micromolar range, too. The title compounds are among the most potent inhibitors of both enzymes known to date.
TI  - [Clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (MEPM) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). The subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. MEPM 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. It was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). Bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of Serratia marcescens. Mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of GPT, gamma-GTP, BUN and elevation of ALP. Based on the above, continuous infusion of MEPM on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of MEPM.
TI  - [Use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  - Our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. Due to the time elapsed from the time of specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. We therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. Expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. We divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (Seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. Paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together. The time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). The identified causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). Samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. The utility of transport medium for examination of general bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. The rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. Therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Group B streptococcal bacteremia in non-pregnant adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An increasing incidence of group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in non-pregnant adults has been noted in recent years. To understand the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of GBS bacteremia in non-pregnant adults, we conducted a retrospective study at a tertiary teaching hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 94 non-pregnant adults (age >/=18 years) with GBS bacteremia hospitalized between January 2001 and December 2003. RESULTS: The incidence of GBS bacteremia increased from 0.16 cases/1000 admissions in 2001 to 0.30 cases/1000 admissions in 2003 (p=0.017, chi-squared test for trend). The mean age of patients was 64.7 +/- 1.39 years. At least 1 underlying systemic disease was found in 81% of patients, with the most frequent being malignancy (43.6%), diabetes mellitus (42.6%), and liver cirrhosis (16%). The 2 major clinical syndromes were primary bacteremia (34%) and soft tissue infection (31.9%). The overall mortality rate was 20.2%. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 2 most common concurrently isolated bloodstream pathogens. Polymicrobial bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and shock were independent risk factors for mortality in GBS bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing incidence of GBS bacteremia is noteworthy, especially among patients with invasive infections. These infections are also responsible for substantial mortality in elderly patients with underlying diseases. Susceptibility testing indicated that penicillin G remains the drug of choice for GBS bacteremia.
TI  - Functional analysis of glucan binding protein B from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Mutans streptococci are major etiological agents of dental caries, and several of their secreted products contribute to bacterial accumulation on teeth. Of these, Streptococcus mutans glucan binding protein B (GbpB) is a novel, immunologically dominant protein. Its biological function is unclear, although GbpB shares homology with a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, indicative of a role in murein biosynthesis. To determine the cellular function of GbpB, we used several approaches to inactivate the gene, analyze its expression, and identify interacting proteins. None of the transformants analyzed were true gbpB mutants, since they all contained both disrupted and wild-type gene copies, and expression of functional GbpB was always conserved. Thus, the inability to obtain viable gbpB null mutants supports the notion that gbpB is an essential gene. Northern blot and real-time PCR analyses suggested that induction of gbpB expression in response to stress was a strain-dependent phenomenon. Proteins that interacted with GbpB were identified in pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and these data suggest that GbpB interacts with ribosomal protein L7/L12, possibly as part of a protein complex involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division.
TI  - Understanding the bacterial polysaccharide antigenicity of Streptococcus agalactiae versus Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Bacterial surface capsular polysaccharides (CPS) that are similar in carbohydrate sequence may differ markedly in immunogenicity and antigenicity. The structural origin of these phenomena is poorly understood. Such a case is presented by the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus; GBS) type III (GBSIII) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pn) type 14 (Pn14), which share closely related CPS sequences. Nevertheless, antibodies (Abs) against GBSIII rarely cross-react with the CPS from Pn14. To establish the origin for the variation in CPS antigenicity, models for the immune complexes of CPS fragments from GBSIII and Pn14, with the variable fragment (Fv) of a GBS-specific mAb (mAb 1B1), are presented. The complexes are generated through a combination of comparative Ab modeling and automated ligand docking, followed by explicitly solvated 10-ns molecular dynamics simulations. The relationship between carbohydrate sequence and antigenicity is further quantified through the computation of interaction energies using the Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method, augmented by conformational entropy estimates. Despite the electrostatic differences between Pn14 and GBSIII CPS, analysis indicates that entropic penalties are primarily responsible for the loss of affinity of the highly flexible Pn14 CPS for mAb 1B1. The similarity of the solution conformation of the relatively rigid GBSIII CPS with that in the immune complex characterizes the previously undescribed 3D structure of the conformational epitope. The analysis provides a comprehensive interpretation for a large body of biochemical and immunological data related to Ab recognition of bacterial polysaccharides and should be applicable to other Ab-carbohydrate interactions.
TI  - Design of new benzoxazole-2-thione-derived inhibitors of Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronan lyase: structure of a complex with a 2-phenylindole.
AB  - The bacterial hyaluronan lyases (Hyals) that degrade hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix, are involved in microbial spread. Inhibitors of these enzymes are essential in investigation of the role of hyaluronan and Hyal in bacterial infections and constitute a new class of antibiotics against Hyal-producing bacteria. Recently, we identified 1,3-diacetylbenzimidazole-2-thione and related molecules as inhibitors of streptococcal Hyal. One of such compounds, 1-decyl-2-(4-sulfamoyloxyphenyl)-1-indol-6-yl sulfamate, was co-crystallized in a complex with Streptococcus pneumoniae Hyal and its structure elucidated. The resultant X-ray structure demonstrates that this inhibitor fits in the enzymatic active site via interactions resembling the binding mode of the natural hyaluronan substrate. X-ray structural analysis also indicates binding interactions with the catalytic residues and those of a catalytically essential hydrophobic patch. An IC50 value of 11 microM for Hyal from Streptococcus agalactiae (strain 4755) qualifies this phenylindole compound as one of the most potent Hyal inhibitors known to date. The structural data suggested a similar binding mode for N-(3-phenylpropionyl)-benzoxazole-2-thione. This new compound's inhibitory properties were confirmed resulting in discovery of yet another Hyal inhibitor (IC50 of 15 microM). These benzoxazole-2-thiones constitute a new class of inhibitors of bacterial Hyals and are well suited for further optimization of their selectivity, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Alternate structural conformations of Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronan lyase:  insights into enzyme flexibility and underlying molecular mechanism of action.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronan lyase is a surface enzyme of this Gram-positive bacterium. The enzyme degrades several biologically important, information-rich linear polymeric glycans: hyaluronan, unsulfated chondroitin, and some chondroitin sulfates. This degradation facilitates spreading of bacteria throughout the host tissues and presumably provides energy and a carbon source for pneumococcal cells. Its beta-elimination catalytic mechanism is an acid/base process termed proton acceptance and donation leading to cleavage of beta-1,4 linkages of the substrates. The degradation of hyaluronan occurs in two stages, initial endolytic cuts are followed by processive exolytic cleavage of one disaccharide at a time. In contrast, the degradation of chondroitins is purely endolytic. Structural studies together with flexibility analyses of two streptococcal enzymes, from S.pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, allowed for insights into this enzyme's molecular mechanism. Here, two new X-ray crystal structures of the pneumococcal enzyme in novel conformations are reported. These new conformations, complemented by molecular dynamics simulation results, directly confirm the predicted domain motions presumed to facilitate the processive degradative process. One of these new structures resembles the S.agalactiae enzyme conformation, and provides evidence of a uniform mechanistic/dynamic behavior of this protein across different bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. isolated in North America and Europe including the first report of fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2004).
AB  - Beta-hemolytic streptococci are common bacterial pathogens that can cause serious invasive disease, and although this group of species has remained susceptible to the fluoroquinolone class, resistant strains have been reported. This multicenter investigation determined the rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci using the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program network data (1997-2004). Forty-seven surveillance culture isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci from North America and Europe with elevated levofloxacin MIC results (2 to >32) microg/mL were tested for susceptibility to other fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, garenoxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin using reference broth microdilution and Etest (BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) methods. Strains were characterized using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to detect mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR). The beta-hemolytic streptococci isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility included the following Lancefield groups: A (Streptococcus pyogenes; 9 strains), B (Streptococcus agalactiae; 24 strains), C and G (14 strains). Vitek and API 20 strep (bioMerieux, Hazelwood, MO) identification systems, as well as conventional biochemical methods and colony morphology, were used to confirm the organism identifications. The overall potency (MIC90 in microg/mL) for the fluoroquinolones against all tested beta-hemolytic streptococci showed the following rank order: gemifloxacin (0.06) > garenoxacin (0.12) > moxifloxacin (0.25) > gatifloxacin (0.5) > levofloxacin = ciprofloxacin (1). The rate of levofloxacin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci in the SENTRY program was 0.14% (Europe) and 0.51% (North America) during the study period. All levofloxacin-resistant strains tested by molecular methods had significant mutations in either parC (position 79 or 83) and/or gyrA (position 81 or 85). All but 2 isolates with high-level resistance to levofloxacin (>32 microg/mL) had gyrA mutations. Strains with lower MIC values to levofloxacin (2-4 microg/mL) only had mutations in parC. The increasing rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and the more recently reported beta-hemolytic streptococci, is becoming a clinical concern due to the morbidity and mortality caused by these pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - [Trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan (2003-2004)].
AB  - We surveyed the epidemiology of pediatric bacterial meningitis between January 2003 and December 2004 in Japan, with the following results: Bacterial meningitis cases numbered 233 (132 boys, 98 girls, and 3 unidentified), equivalent to 1.13-1.6 children of 1000 hospitalized in pediatrics per year. The age distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age, decreasing with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. The relationship between causactive pathogens and age distribution was as follows: group B. streptococcus and E. coli were major pathogens below 4 months of age and H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were major pathogens above 4 months of age. Susceptibility tests at each facility demonstrated that 65.0% of H. influenzae isolates and 83.0% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 2004 were drug-resistant. Ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are currently effective against GBS, E. coli and Listeria so a combination of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics is used first line at many facilities for patients below 4 months of age. A combination of carbapenem which showed effective against PRSP and cephem which showed effective against H. influenzae is the first choice in childhood bacterial meningitis for patients above 4 months of age.
TI  - A retrospective study of the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania.
AB  - A 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania over the period November 1971-December 2002. Laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. Eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and Escherichia coli (14.1%). Other isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and Streptococcus uberis (4.2%). Contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were Candida species. The results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical Candida albicans mastitis. The prevalence of Candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in November 2002. Conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae remain above 10%. The possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.
TI  - c-Jun kinase is a critical signaling molecule in a neonatal model of group B streptococcal sepsis.
AB  - Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the major cause of sepsis in newborn infants. In vitro, inactivated GBS stimulates macrophages to produce inflammatory proteins via the TLR adapter protein MyD88. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine release in response to GBS greatly exceeds that following stimulation with pneumococci. In this study, we attempted to unravel signaling events that are involved in GBS-, but not Streptococcus pneumoniae-stimulated phagocytes to identify molecular targets for adjunctive sepsis therapy. We found that inactivated GBS and S. pneumoniae differed in the activation of the MAPK JNK, but not IkappaB kinase. Furthermore, JNK was essential for the transcriptional activation of inflammatory cytokine genes in response to GBS. Inhibition of JNK by the anthrapyrazolone SP600125 abrogated GBS-induced cytokine formation via an AP-1- and NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism without impairing antibacterial properties such as phagocytosis of GBS and the formation of intracellular oxidative species. In contrast, inhibition of the MAPK p38 impaired both antibacterial processes. In a neonatal mouse model of GBS sepsis SP600125 inhibited the inflammatory response and improved survival. In conclusion, JNK plays a major role in the inflammatory, but not in the direct antibacterial response to inactivated GBS, and may thus serve as a rational target for an adjunctive GBS sepsis therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and other antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria from the major teaching hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are an increasingly pressing problem in the clinic. Consequently, linezolid, a recently introduced oxazolidinone with Gram-positive activity, was tested in comparison with 10 other antibiotics against 8103 clinically significant Gram-positive cocci by Etest, disk diffusion and Vitek methods. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activities against all isolates. Vancomycin and teicoplanin demonstrated equally excellent activity against almost all isolates. The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were all susceptible to the glycopeptides and linezolid, but resistant to erythromycin (96%), fusidic acid (91.5%), gentamicin (84%) and clindamycin (73%). Forty one and 39% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 microg/ml) and erythromycin (MIC >1 microg/ml), respectively. S. agalactiae susceptibility was 9% and 10% resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin, respectively. In conclusion, all the Gram-positive isolates tested were susceptible to linezolid. With its oral bioavailability profiles, it obviously holds great promise. Our data should be a useful addition to the literature from the Middle East.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1999 and 2003].
AB  - We evaluated 83 children with bacterial meningitis in 67 of 81 insitutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1999 and 2003 by questionnaire. The incidence of bacterial meningitis in children aged < 5 years and 5 < or =, < 10 years was 6.3 and 0.7 cases per 100, 000 children/year. The incidences of meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae in children aged < 5 years were 3.7, 1.4 and 0.8. Median age was 13 months ranging from 0 day to 9 years. Seventy-four (89.1%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 39 (47.0%) less than 1 year old. Major causative organisms were H. influenzae in 51 patients, S. pneumoniae in 18, S. agalactiae in 9 and E. coli in 3. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case mortality rate of 4.8%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 25.3%, predominantly epilepsy, hearing loss, and developmental delay of varying severity. The frequency of poor prognosis was 55.6% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae compared with 21.6% for H. influenzae and 22.2% for S. agalactiae.
TI  - Evaluation of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel was evaluated for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of various streptococci. A group of 97 consecutive clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 24 Streptococcus agalactiae, and 34 viridans streptococci were collected and comparisons made with routine manual methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Overall, in 162 (91%) of 178 isolates, Phoenix identification results demonstrated agreement. For AST results for the 162 isolates that demonstrated identification concordance, the overall essential agreement rate was 98.5%; the category agreement was 94.9%; and the very major error, major error, and minor error rates were 0%, 0.15%, and 5.8%, respectively. Although relatively high minor error rates were observed with S. pneumoniae and beta-lactams, 79.2% of the 77 minor errors were the result of a single log(2) dilution difference. The Phoenix SMIC/ID panel performed favorably and demonstrated the advantages of automation and simple methodology.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - Evaluation of the BD Phoenix SMIC/ID, a new streptococci identification and antimicrobial susceptibility panel, for potential routine use in a university-based clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - We evaluated the new BD Phoenix automated microbiology system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) SMIC/ID-4 panel for routine identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of streptococci in a university-based laboratory. Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 92), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 24), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 10) were collected, and comparisons were made with the routine manual methods used in our microbiology laboratory for ID and susceptibility testing. ID concordance with manual methods was 85.9%, 95.8%, and 90.0% for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. With respect to AST concordance for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae) using Phoenix and standard broth microdilution panels, overall essential agreement was 93.0% and 97.5%, respectively, whereas overall category agreement was 92.4% and 98.9%, respectively. Major and minor error rates for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci were 0.5% and 0.3%, and 7.1% and 0.8%, respectively. Very major errors were not observed in this study. Mean time for ID and AST test completion was 13.6 +/- 1.6, 10.7 +/- 2.4, and 11.2 +/- 2.3 h for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. We have demonstrated that Phoenix ID results show high agreement with manual ID and that AST performance was equivalent to standard broth microdilution in less time.
TI  - [Bacterial flora and mycosis of the vagina in women with symptoms of vaginal inflammation].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the microbiological profile of vaginal flora in 30 women  with gynecologic problems and 20 pregnant women complaining about pathological symptoms {pruritus, burning, vaginal discharge}. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The discharge from posterior vaginal vault was examined microbiologically on the Columbia Agar with sheep blood, MacConkey and Sabourand cultures incubated of 48 hours in the temperature of 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bacterial infections were detected in 33 cases (66%), 12 of these women (24%) lived in urban, 21 (42%) in rural environment. From bacteria isolated from the vagina, most often because at 14 women stepped out Streptococcus agalactiae, at 11 Enterococcus faecalis at 8 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases bacterial inflammation was caused by two kinds of bacterium. At two women stepped out both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. In single cases it was Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. In all cases of inflammation mycosis was called out by from Candida albicans. One ascertained it at 14 among all given an examination women. Mixed inflammations called out both by mycosis and bacterial stepped out in 3 cases in age of 21-30. At two women it was Candida albicans and Streptococcus agalactiae, at one inflammation mycosis accompanied Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The common reason of vaginitis are bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, E coli. Both, place of living and women' s age influence the type of etiological factor.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Genomic subtraction followed by dot blot screening of Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical and carriage isolates identifies genetic differences associated with strains that cause otitis media.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae strains are the leading cause of bacterial otitis media, yet little is known about specific bacterial factors important for this disease. We utilized a molecular epidemiological approach involving genomic subtraction of the S. pneumoniae serogroup 19 middle ear strain 5093 against the laboratory strain R6. Resulting subtraction PCR (sPCR) products were used to screen a panel of 93 middle ear, 90 blood, 35 carriage, and 58 cerebrospinal fluid isolates from young children to identify genes found more frequently among middle ear isolates. Probe P41, similar to a hypothetical protein of Brucella melitensis, occurred among 41% of middle ear isolates and was found 2.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32 to 6.5), 3.3 (95% CI, 1.9 to 5.7), and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0) times more frequently among middle ear strains than carriage, blood, or meningitis strains, respectively. sPCR fragment H10, similar to an unknown Streptococcus agalactiae protein, was present in 31% of middle ear isolates and occurred 3.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 11.2), 2.8 (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.4), and 2.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 5.5) times more often among middle ear isolates than carriage, blood, or meningitis strains, respectively. These studies have identified two genes of potential importance in otitis media virulence. Further studies are warranted to outline the precise role of these genes in otitis media pathogenesis.
TI  - Breast milk as a source of late onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis can be a life-threatening complication in preterm neonates. We present the clinical course of 3 preterm neonates, 1 with recurrent sepsis and 2 with late onset sepsis attributed to ingestion of breast milk containing pathogenic organisms. Breast milk should be considered as a potential source of infection in neonates with recurrent infections or when infections occur simultaneously in siblings.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (CPFX) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - Patterns of sequence divergence in 5' intergenic spacers and linked coding regions in 10 species of pathogenic bacteria reveal distinct recombinational histories.
AB  - We compared the pattern of nucleotide difference in 8034 genes and in their 5' intergenic spacers between conspecific pairs of genomes from 10 species of pathogenic bacteria. Certain genes or spacers showed much greater sequence divergence between the genotypes compared to others; such divergent regions plausibly originated by recombinational events by which a gene and/or spacers was donated from a divergent genome. Different patterns of divergence in genes and spacers identified different recombinational patterns. For example, in Chlamydophila pneumoniae, there were examples of both unusually divergent spacers and unusually divergent genes, but there were no cases in which a gene and its spacer were both unusually divergent. This pattern suggests that, in C. pneumoniae, recombination events have broken up the linkage between genes and 5' spacers. By contrast, in Streptococcus agalactiae, there were a number of cases in which both spacer and gene were unusually divergent, indicating that a number of large-scale recombination events that included both genes and 5' spacers have occurred; there was evidence of at least two large-scale recombination events in the genomic region including the pur genes in S. agalactiae.
TI  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor protects against multiple forms of brain injury in bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) blocks activation of caspase-3, reduces translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), attenuates excitotoxicity of glutamate, and increases antioxidant enzyme activities. The mechanisms of neuroprotection suggest that BDNF may be beneficial in bacterial meningitis. METHODS: To assess a potentially beneficial effect of adjuvant treatment with BDNF in bacterial meningitis, 11-day-old infant rats with experimental meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or group B streptococci (GBS) were randomly assigned to receive intracisternal injections with either BDNF (3 mg/kg) or equal volumes (10 mu L) of saline. Twenty-two hours after infection, brains were analyzed, by histomorphometrical examination, for the extent of cortical and hippocampal neuronal injury. RESULTS: Compared with treatment with saline, treatment with BDNF significantly reduced the extent of 3 distinct forms of brain cell injury in this disease model: cortical necrosis in meningitis due to GBS (median, 0.0% [range, 0.0%-33.7%] vs. 21.3% [range, 0.0%-55.3%]; P<.03), caspase-3-dependent cell death in meningitis due to S. pneumoniae (median score, 0.33 [range, 0.0-1.0] vs. 1.10 [0.10-1.56]; P<.05), and caspase-3-independent hippocampal cell death in meningitis due to GBS (median score, 0 [range, 0-2] vs. 0.88 [range, 0-3.25]; P<.02). The last form of injury was associated with nuclear translocation of AIF. CONCLUSION: BDNF efficiently reduces multiple forms of neuronal injury in bacterial meningitis and may hold promise as adjunctive therapy for this disease.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Bacterial capsular polysaccharide and sugar transferases.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides (CPs) of several pathogenic bacteria are thought to be good materials for the development of new therapeutic reagents. These polysaccharides can be used as vaccines against infection of pathogenic bacteria and are also useful as inhibitors for disease caused by aberrant and abnormal cell-cell interaction, such as cancer metastasis and inflammation. Since bacterial CPs are diverse in structure and these bacteria have a variety of sugar transferases responsible for the synthesis of CPs, bacterial CP synthesis (cps) genes have attracted much interest as a source of glycosyltransferases useful for glycoengineering. In this review, we describe physiological effects of the bacterial CPs on mammalian cells, and the structure and function of the cps genes, by focusing on group B streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia and Ib, that produce high-molecular weight polysaccharides consisting of the following pentasaccharide repeating units: -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1--> and -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)beta-D-Glcp-(1-->, respectively.
TI  - Incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b and other invasive diseases in South Korean children.
AB  - To determine incidence of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in a defined population of Jeonbuk Province, Korea, children <5 years were evaluated in prospective, population-based surveillance of invasive bacterial diseases using standardized methods for patient referral, clinical evaluation and laboratory testing (optimized culture, latex agglutination, polymerase chain reaction). Vaccine utilization was assessed with vaccination histories of patients in surveillance, monthly data on Hib vaccine distribution and a coverage survey of clinic patients in study population. From September 1999 to December 2001, 2176 children were evaluated for possible meningitis, 1541 had no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings of meningitis, 605 had CSF abnormalities (suspected bacterial meningitis) but no pathogen identified; six patients had probable Hib meningitis and eight had confirmed Hib meningitis. The annual suspected bacterial meningitis incidence was 258.4/100,000 <5 years and the probable/confirmed Hib meningitis incidence was 6.0/100,000 <5 years. Pneumococcal meningitis incidence was 2.1/100,000 <5 years and Group B streptococcal meningitis incidence was 0.17/1000 live births. A total of 69,589 Hib vaccine doses were distributed during the study. Hib vaccine coverage was negligible initially but increased to 16% (complete Hib immunization) and 27% (partial immunization) in final months of study. Suspected bacterial meningitis incidence was high but proven invasive Hib meningitis incidence was low. Hib was leading cause of bacterial meningitis yet bacterial pathogens were identified in only 4% of abnormal CSF. These findings may reflect truly low incidence, presumptive antibiotic treatment, partial Hib immunization, or incomplete clinical evaluations. Given the apparent Hib meningitis burden in Jeonbuk Province, additional studies to describe other invasive Hib syndromes, Hib-associated mortality and disability, and economic impact of Hib disease will be useful to guide public health decisions regarding routine Hib vaccine introduction.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - Seasonal evaluation of antigenic bacterial infections among working class in the  inner city of Houston.
AB  - This paper evaluates the monthly, quarterly, and seasonal variation of antigenic  bacterial infections among the working class in the inner city of Houston using the Wellcogen Rapid Test methods. One of the aims was to demonstrate how this method could be used effectively in screening patients at risk and preventing the spread of antigenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus (Strep b), and Neisseria meningitidis (mainly group c and b). A total of 2,837 patients were screened for bacterial infections; 908 (32%) were male and 1,929 (68%) were female. The age range was between 2 and 70 years. Of the total group, 356 (12.5%) patients were positive; 203 (57%) were female while 153 (43%) were male (male/female ratio of 1:1.3). Medically underserved and immune suppressed populations are the most affected by these bacterial infections. Blacks are the most affected (48%) compared to Native Americans (1%), but children under 10 years of age have the highest incidence. This research showed, in addition, that the Wellcogen Rapid Tests are effective (356 cases identified) for a rapid screening of infectious bacteria. Explanation for these results was probably due to poor living conditions, poor hygiene, and viral immune suppression in adults and immature immune systems in neonates and children under 10 years of age.
TI  - [Purulent pericarditis with pericardial tamponade caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Salmonella enterica no typhi].
AB  - Purulent pericarditis (PP) is an uncommon condition with high mortality. In the preantibiotic period, Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. We describe the case of a 75-year old man with septic shock, PP and cardiac tamponade caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Salmonella enterica no-typhi. To our knowledge this association of pathogenic organisms has not been previously reported in the literature. The pathogenesis is here reviewed, and in our patient presumably, purulent pericarditis occurred via hematogeneus spread undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The patient's course was complicated and he died on 34th hospital day. After this case report it is considered that differential etiologic diagnosis of PP should include these agents, especially in immunodepressed patients with predisposing factors.
TI  - L-Ascorbic acid 6-hexadecanoate, a potent hyaluronidase inhibitor. X-ray structure and molecular modeling of enzyme-inhibitor complexes.
AB  - Hyaluronidases are enzymes that degrade hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix. The mammalian hyaluronidases are considered to be involved in many (patho)physiological processes like fertilization, tumor growth, and metastasis. Bacterial hyaluronidases, also termed hyaluronate lyases, contribute to the spreading of microorganisms in tissues. Such roles for hyaluronidases suggest that inhibitors could be useful pharmacological tools. Potent and selective inhibitors are not known to date, although L-ascorbic acid has been reported to be a weak inhibitor of Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL). The x-ray structure of SpnHL complexed with L-ascorbic acid has been elucidated suggesting that additional hydrophobic interactions might increase inhibitory activity. Here we show that L-ascorbic acid 6-hexadecanoate (Vcpal) is a potent inhibitor of both streptococcal and bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH). Vcpal showed strong inhibition of Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase with an IC(50) of 4 microM and weaker inhibition of SpnHL and BTH with IC(50) values of 100 and 56 microM, respectively. To date, Vcpal has proved to be one of the most potent inhibitors of hyaluronidase. We also determined the x-ray structure of the SpnHL-Vcpal complex and confirmed the hypothesis that additional hydrophobic interactions with Phe-343, His-399, and Thr-400 in the active site led to increased inhibition. A homology structural model of BTH was also generated to suggest binding modes of Vcpal to this hyaluronidase. The long alkyl chain seemed to interact with an extended, hydrophobic channel formed by mostly conserved amino acids Ala-84, Leu-91, Tyr-93, Tyr-220, and Leu-344 in BTH.
TI  - Defective cell wall synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 depleted for the essential PcsB putative murein hydrolase or the VicR (YycF) response regulator.
AB  - PcsB is a protein of unknown function(s) that influences the cell morphology of several pathogenic species of streptococcus. PcsB contains a CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase) domain found in bacterial murein hydrolases; however, direct links between steps in cell wall biosynthesis and PcsB function(s) have not been demonstrated. We show here that pcsB is essential in the human respiratory pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, that depletion of PcsB is bacteriostatic and that alanine substitutions in the conserved cysteine and histidine residues of the CHAP domain appear to be lethal. We stained wild-type parent and mutant bacteria deficient in expression of PcsB with fluorescent vancomycin and DAPI to determine patterns of cell wall synthesis and nucleoid segregation respectively. The wild-type parent strain exhibited ordered, simultaneous septal and equatorial cell wall synthesis. In contrast, reduced expression of PcsB resulted in formation of long chains of cells in which peptidoglycan synthesis occurred at nearly every division septum and cell equator. Severe depletion of PcsB led to abnormal, uncontrolled cell wall synthesis at misplaced septa and around large cells. Together, these physiological properties are consistent with a role for PcsB as a murein hydrolase that balances the extent of cell wall synthesis in S. pneumoniae. Finally, we show that the defects in morphology and cell wall synthesis that result from depletion of PcsB strongly resemble those caused by depletion of the essential VicRK two component regulatory system (TCS). This result and the essentiality of pcsB support the hypothesis that the essentiality of the VicRK TCS results from its positive regulation of PcsB expression.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in France in 2002].
AB  - In France, two sources of data, the mandatory notification and the hospital laboratory network EPIBAC, allow the health authorities to monitor the incidence of bacterial meningitis. In 2002 around 1,500 cases were estimated in France. The more common microorganisms were: Streptococcus pneumoniae 49% (incidence 1.19/100,000), Neisseria meningitidis 33% (incidence 0.83) and Streptococcus agalactiae (Streptococcus B) 11% (incidence 0.27). Listeria monocytogenes accounted for 4% of the cases (incidence 0.11) and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 3% (incidence 0.08). Trends in incidence showed an increase of meningococci meningitis since 1996, a steady decrease of H. influenzae and Listeria meningitis since 1992, and a quasi stable number of pneumococci meningitis, streptococci B meningitis and tuberculosis meningitis in the last 10 years. The impact of preventive measures on the incidence of Listeria meningitis and H. influenzae b meningitis has been clearly demonstrated through the dramatic decrease of meningitis due to these microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative genomics of streptococcal species.
AB  - Microbial genome sequencing has produced an unprecedented amount of new information and insights into an organism's metabolic activities, virulence properties, and evolution. The complete genome sequence has been reported for four different species of streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. mutans. Comparative genome analysis among organisms of the same species not only shows a high degree of similarity in gene content and organization, but also a high degree of sequence heterogeneity as evidenced by the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms present. Considerable differences were also observed in the number of mobile genetic elements found in each organism, including complete and partial bacteriophage genomes, IS elements, transposons, and plasmids. S. pyogenes was the only species to contain complete bacteriophage genomes in its genome, while only S. pneumoniae and S. mutans contained the full complement of competence genes essential for natural transformation. Comparative genome analysis between the species showed that S. pyogenes was more closely related to S. agalactiae than with S. pneumoniae or S. mutans.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - [Effect of specific immunoglobulin Y in the treatment of acute and chronic pharyngitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect and safety of the specific immunoglobulin Y (IgY) for treatment of acute and chronic pharyngitis. METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 50 adults with acute pharyngitis. Experimental group received a 6 times-daily total 30 doses of IgY stomat-spray which contained specific immunoglobulin Y (titer = 512) prepared from the egg yolk of hens immunized with a variety of bacteria. Another open label trial included 50 patients, whose ages ranged from 21-69 years, including 25 cases of acute pharyngitis and 25 cases of chronic pharyngitis were also treated using IgY stomat-spray. The therapeutic effect were objectively evaluated 7 days later by the decreased scores based on both the symptoms and physical signs. If the symptom did not improve or became severe three days later, these patients with acute pharyngitis was inefficiency and antibiotic medicine would be added to them. RESULTS: In Double-blind trial, 8 cases (32%) received IgY had apparent effect with the decreased scores 5 or more than 5, 13 cases (52%) had effective with the decreased scores 3-4, and other 4 cases (16%) had inefficacy with the decreased scores only 2 or no more than 2. While in placebo-controlled group, only 2 (8%) cases had apparent effect, 5 (20%) cases showed effective and 18 (72%) cases had non-effect. The difference between the two groups was significant (chi 2 = 16.06, P < 0.01). In open label trial, 19 cases (38%) showed apparent effect, in which 14 cases were acute pharygitis. 23 cases (46%) had effective, in which 10 cases were acute pharyngitis. The left 8 cases (16%) had ineffective, in which one case was acute pharyngitis. There was significantly difference (chi 2 = 8.90, P < 0.05) between acute pharyngitis and chronic pharyngitis. An average of three months followup showed that there were no side effect or toxic effect and no allergic reaction. CONCLUSION: The IgY stomat-spray is a safe and effective agent in treating acute and chronic pharyngitis, especially for acute pharyngitis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Zebrafish as a model host for streptococcal pathogenesis.
AB  - Streptococcal pathogens continue to evade concerted efforts to determine clear-cut virulence mechanisms, although numerous genes have been implicated in pathogenesis. A single species can infect a diversity of tissues, suggesting the expression of specific virulence factors based on the local tissue environment or stage of infection. In an effort to identify the interactions that occur between the host and pathogen that lead to activation of virulence mechanisms and contribute to specific streptococcal disease states, we have developed a unique animal model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), to characterize specific virulence mechanisms utilized within various tissues in vivo. We are using this model host to study infection by two streptococcal species that represent two forms of streptococcal disease: a natural pathogen of fish and humans, Streptococcus iniae and a human-specific pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes. S. iniae primarily causes a fatal systemic disease in the zebrafish following intra-muscular injection, with similar pathologies to that seen in human infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and S. pneumoniae. While the fatal infection by S. pyogenes causes a locally spreading necrotic disease confined to the muscle with pathology similar to what is observed in a human infection of necrotizing fasciitis. By studying pathogens that are virulent for both fish and humans and that mediate disease states in the zebrafish that are identical to those found in human streptococcal infections, we will be able to identify common virulence strategies shared by a number of Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  - Young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. Cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. Present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. Three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of AOM received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. Clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. There was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. A satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. In conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. Moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.
TI  - Correlation of antigenic epitope and antibody gene usage in the human immune response to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 23F capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - The human antibody response to the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 23F is predominated by antibodies which express either VkappaL6 or VkappaA23 light chain genes. In this report, we demonstrate that the antigenic epitopes recognized by these two families can be differentiated based on their specificity for the hapten l-rhamnose, a constituent sugar of the bacterial capsule polymer. The VkappaL6 family utilizes light chains with an unusually long third complementarity-determining region. These VkappaL6-encoded Fabs are 100-fold more sensitive to inhibition with l-rhamnose than VkappaA23 Fabs. VkappaL6 Fabs preferentially recognize the l-isomer of the hapten and can distinguish l-rhamnose from the structurally similar sugar l-mannose. We also demonstrate that the VkappaL6 family component of the antibody response recognizes the polysaccharide antigens of Group B streptococci (GBS), thereby accounting for the previously reported cross-reaction between PPS 23F-specific antisera and Group B streptococci.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by U.S. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. The widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. Current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (CNS) pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from CNS specimens was analyzed using The Surveillance Database (TSN) USA Database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 US hospital laboratories. A total of 6029 organisms derived from CNS specimen sources during 2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. Gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. The modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. Prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. Penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for S. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for S. agalactiae. For CSF isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was S. pneumoniae (3.5%), E. coli (0.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), Serratia marcescens (5.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (0%). Listeria monocytogenes and N. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. This data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat CNS infections.
TI  - The pathogenesis of streptococcal infections: from tooth decay to meningitis.
AB  - The development of bacterial disease has been likened to a 'molecular arms race', in which the host tries to eliminate the bacteria, while the bacteria try to survive in the host. Although most bacteria do not cause disease, some cause serious human infection in a large proportion of encounters. Between these two extremes are bacteria that can coexist with humans in a carriage state but, under appropriate circumstances, cause disease. The streptococci exemplify this group of organisms, and by studying them we can begin to address why bacteria cause such a wide spectrum of disease.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants: the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognostic factors.
AB  - This 16-year (1986-2001) retrospective study enrolled 80 infantile patients (aged, 30-365 days old) with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. The most prevalent pathogens were Salmonellaspecies, Streptococcus (S.) agalactiae, Escherichia (E.) coli, and Haemophilus (H.) influenzae, accounting for about 59% of the episodes. Meningitis caused by Salmonella species, E. coli and H. influenzae occurs more often in the older infants, while that caused by S. agalactiae occurs more often in young infants. Our study revealed a decrease in the proportion of Salmonella meningitis from 27% in the first 8 years to 9% in the second 8 years with E. coli replacing Salmonella species as the leading pathogen of this disease during the second period. Overall mortality rate for both periods of time was 11%. However, if we take those with undesirable poor outcomes into account, 43% of patients could be considered treatment failures. The study also reveals a high prevalence of neurological complications when this disease is caused by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Salmonella species. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only initial changing levels of consciousness (P = 0.006) were independently associated with treatment failure. The most frequent neurological complications associated with this disease included subdural empyema, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarctions, and seizures. Because therapeutic regimens may require attention to the eradication of bacterial pathogen but also the neurological complications, early diagnosis and choice of appropriate antibiotics are essential to increasing the possibility of survival.
TI  - The group B streptococcal beta and pneumococcal Hic proteins are structurally related immune evasion molecules that bind the complement inhibitor factor H in an analogous fashion.
AB  - Complement evasion by different mechanisms is important for microbial virulence and survival in the host. One strategy used by pathogenic bacteria is to bind the soluble complement inhibitor factor H (fH) to their surfaces. In group B streptococci and pneumococci, fH binding has been shown to be mediated by the surface proteins beta and Hic, respectively. We showed previously that Hic binds to the middle region of fH and protects the pneumococcus from opsonophagocytosis. As the beta protein and Hic are structurally closely related, we wanted to compare the fH binding characteristics of these two proteins. By using direct binding assays with radiolabeled proteins and surface plasmon resonance analysis we show that both beta and Hic bind to the short consensus repeats 8-11 and 12-14 in the middle region of fH. Peptide mapping analysis suggested that the fH-binding sites on beta and Hic were composed of discontinuous and partially homologous sequences. Thus, the bacterial virulence proteins use multiple binding sites on fH to secure high avidity. Also, the functionally active sites on fH are thereby left free to inhibit C3b deposition and opsonophagocytosis. These results reveal the evolutionary conservation of an analogous immune evasion strategy in different types of pathogenic streptococci. Importantly, the respective virulence factors could be exploited in the development of protein-based vaccines against these pathogens.
TI  - Comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme M and  P.
AB  - Lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. Mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme M and P, but only the M enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. Disruption of the lysozyme M locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a Gram-negative bacterium. Unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme M-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. Muramidase activity in lysozyme M-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme P mRNA and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. The muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme P was less than that of recombinant M lysozyme. Recombinant P lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected Gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme M to achieve the same level of killing. The lower antimicrobial activity of P lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by P lysozyme in lysozyme M-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. Recombinant lysozyme M and P were equally effective in killing selected Gram-positive organisms. This outcome suggests that disruption of both M and P loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the peptide deformylase inhibitor BB-83698.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: BB-83698 is a peptide deformylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials in Europe. The purpose of this study was to provide additional susceptibility data from clinical isolates, including drug-resistant strains. METHODS: The in vitro activities of BB-83698 and comparators were determined against 281 streptococci, 154 Staphylococcus aureus, 110 Haemophilus influenzae and 50 Moraxella catarrhalis strains selected for their resistance phenotypes. Broth microdilution MICs and MBCs were determined according to NCCLS guidelines. RESULTS: The MIC90s were 0.25-0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-, erythromycin-, levofloxacin- and multidrug-resistant strains. The MIC90s for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.12 mg/L and for viridans streptococci, the MIC90 was 0.5 mg/L. Against S. aureus, including oxacillin- and levofloxacin-resistant strains, and vancomycin-intermediate strains, the MIC90 was 8 mg/L. Against beta-lactamase-negative and -positive H. influenzae, the MIC90s were 32 and 64 mg/L, respectively, and against both beta-lactamase-negative and -positive M. catarrhalis the MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. In MBC studies, the ratio of MBC/MIC was 1:1 or 2:1 against 31% of S. pneumoniae, 33% of S. aureus, 63% of H. influenzae and 9% of M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BB-83698 has reduced in vitro activity against H. influenzae, it is a potent antimicrobial with excellent activity against streptococci and Moraxella.
TI  - rpoB gene sequence-based identification of aerobic Gram-positive cocci of the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Abiotrophia, and Granulicatella.
AB  - We developed a new molecular tool based on rpoB gene (encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. We first sequenced the complete rpoB gene for Streptococcus anginosus, S. equinus, and Abiotrophia defectiva. Sequences were aligned with these of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae available in GenBank. Using an in-house analysis program (SVARAP), we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and, by using these conserved zones as PCR primer targets, we amplified and sequenced this variable region in an additional 30 Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Abiotrophia species. This region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. We therefore applied our identification system by PCR amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. Amplicons were obtained in streptococci and Bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. Molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the S. pneumoniae-S. oralis-S. mitis group and the S. agalactiae-S. difficile group. These signatures allowed us to design a S. pneumoniae-specific PCR and sequencing primer pair.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide derivative exhibiting innovative microbiological properties against well-characterised antibiotic resistant pathogens in Italy.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. ABT773 was active (MIC-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were also inhibited (MIC-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. Enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to ABT773 with the exception of VanA mutants. E. faecium showed poor susceptibility to ABT773. The activity of the new ketolide against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. ABT773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Constitutive expression of PcsB suppresses the requirement for the essential VicR (YycF) response regulator in Streptococcus pneumoniae R6.
AB  - We report several new findings about the function of the essential VicRK two-component regulatory system (TCS) in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. The vicR-encoded response regulator, vicK-encoded histidine kinase and the protein encoded by the downstream vicX gene are the homologues of the YycF, YycG and YycJ proteins, respectively, studied previously in Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Using a regulatable promoter, we demonstrated that the VicK histidine kinase is conditionally required for growth of S. pneumoniae. Likewise, we found that the VicX protein is also conditionally required for growth and probably plays a role in the essential signal transduction pathway mediated by VicR and VicK. Recovery of limited substitutions in the conserved aspartate 52 residue (D52) of VicR was consistent with a requirement for phosphorylation of VicR for growth under some conditions. We applied microarrays to characterize the changes in transcription patterns in bacteria depleted for vicRKX operon expression. Our results suggest that the pcsB gene is a target of the VicRK TCS. We present evidence that downregulation of pcsB could account for many of the defects in cell growth, shape, size and morphology observed in bacteria depleted for vicRKX expression. Furthermore, constitutive expression of pcsB+ suppressed the essential requirement for the VicRK TCS and allowed the isolation of vicR null mutants.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - NMR and molecular modeling of complex carbohydrates and carbohydrate-protein interactions. Applications to anti-bacteria vaccines.
AB  - In order to characterize the conformational epitope of the group B meningococcal  polysaccharide and of the type III group B Streptococcus capsular polysaccharide NMR measurements were done on a wide variety of native and modified polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Since these saccharides are highly mobile and exist as random coils in solution, the analysis of the NMR data and molecular modeling was done to take into account this inherent flexibility. The conformational model of extended high-order helices being selected upon binding to a protein, although still hypothetical at this stage, has proven useful in explaining the serology for the conformational epitopes for polysaccharides of group B Neisseria meningitidis, group B Streptococcus type III and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. Bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. S. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. Antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as EM and CAM, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide, RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than 14-membered macrolides. Six, three and four strains of S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. Thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, MIC of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of EM, CAM or AZM. Isolation frequency of resistant strains to RKM was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides: only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. No resistant strain was recognized in M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Further, we analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant strains by the double-disk method. Methylation was major mechanism in S. aureus, and in S. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. In S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.
TI  - Complement resistance mechanisms of streptococci.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes), group B streptococcus (GBS,  Streptococcus agalactiae) and pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) are all human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. These related species cause different spectra of infections spanning from trivial upper respiratory tract or skin infections to septic and severe diseases. In order to cause deep infections and survive in the human body the bacteria must evade the immune system. Complement is an important part of innate immunity both as an opsonizing and membrane destructing cascade and as an effector system of antibodies. In this review, we describe the complement resistance mechanisms of the three clinically most important streptococcal species, groups A and B streptococci and pneumococcus. The complement evasion mechanisms of these three species are analogous, yet different from one another. Several strains of all three species express molecules (M-proteins, Bac or beta, PspC) that acquire host fluid-phase complement regulators factor H or C4b binding protein to their surfaces. Groups A and B streptococci also secrete proteins and/or enzymes that inhibit the activation of the complement system or chemotaxis caused by the complement activation products. Even though a lot is known about the immune evasion by streptococci, the high morbidity and mortality associated with infections caused by streptococci and the need for efficient vaccines warrant further studies on the streptococcal molecules mediating complement resistance.
TI  - Seven-year review of paediatric bacteraemias diagnosed in a Spanish university hospital.
AB  - This study analysed the clinical and bacteriological patterns of paediatric bacteraemia in a university hospital, by a review of 213 episodes over a period of 7 y. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent aetiological agent after the neonatal period and Streptococcus agalactiae in neonatal sepsis. Almost half of pneumococci and meningococci were penicillin non-susceptible. Four neonatal deaths attributed to bacteraemia were recorded. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired bacteraemia. Mortality due to bacteraemia in children without underlying conditions is rare.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis causes two distinct forms of cellular damage in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in infant rats.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis causes neurological sequelae in up to 50% of survivors. Two  pathogens known for their propensity to cause severe neurological damage are Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B streptococci. Some forms of neuronal sequelae, such as learning and memory deficits, have been associated with neuronal injury in the hippocampus. To learn more about hippocampal injury in meningitis, we performed a comparative study in bacterial meningitis due to S. pneumoniae and group B streptococcus, in which 11-day-old infant rats were infected intracisternally with either of the two pathogens. Histopathological examination of the neuronal injury in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus showed that S. pneumoniae caused predominantly classical apoptotic cell death. Cells undergoing apoptosis were located only in the subgranular zone and stained positive for activated caspase-3 and TUNEL. Furthermore, dividing progenitor cells seemed particularly sensitive to this form of cell death. Group B streptococcus was mainly responsible for a caspase-3-independent (and TUNEL-negative) form of cell death. Compared with the morphological features found in apoptosis (e.g., apoptotic bodies), this form of neuronal death was characterized by clusters of uniformly shrunken cells. It affected the dentate gyrus throughout the blade, showing no preferences for immature or mature neurons. Thus, depending on the infecting agent, bacterial meningitis causes two distinct forms of cell injury in the dentate gyrus.
TI  - Genome-based identification of a carbohydrate binding module in Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase.
AB  - Hyaluronate lyase enzymes degrade hyaluronan, the main polysaccharide component of the connective tissues of higher animals, thereby destroying the normal connective tissue structure and exposing the host tissue cells to various endo- and exogenous factors, including bacterial toxins. The 3D crystal structures of functionally active but truncated Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. agalactiae hyaluronate lyases, along with their substrate and product complexes, have been determined. The enzymes are multidomain proteins with helical barrel-like catalytic domains and two types of beta-sheet domains. Here, through genome-based bioinformatics studies we identify an additional beta-sheet domain present in the most N-terminal part of streptococcal hyaluronate lyases. Fold recognition and modeling studies show that the domain is structurally similar to carbohydrate binding modules and is therefore likely to be directly involved in hyaluronan binding. Likely carbohydrate binding residues were identified and electrostatic complementarity of the hyaluronate lyase domain with hyaluronan demonstrated. The newly identified presumed hyaluronan binding domain likely improves catalytic efficiency by colocalizing the enzyme and its substrate. Other possible functions are discussed. Two contacting aromatic residues are conserved in the hydrophobic core of the hyaluronate lyase domain and in many, perhaps all, families in the superfamily in which they may be placed. This observation may help the identification and classification of other carbohydrate binding modules.
TI  - Prevalence of cefotaxime resistance in group B streptococcus isolates from Osaka, Japan.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus; GBS) organisms are a major cause of severe infections, including bacteremia and meningitis in newborns. According to previous reports, GBS organisms are uniformly sensitive to penicillin G (PCG). The susceptibility of 117 strains isolated at Yodogawa Christian Hospital in Osaka, Japan, in 2001 was examined with the WalkAway system, using currently valid National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) interpretive criteria. Twenty-one strains (18%) had intermediate susceptibility and 1 strain (1%) was resistant to PCG. Fifty-one strains (44%) had intermediate susceptibility to ampicillin (ABPC). No ABPC-resistant strain was found. Six GBS strains were selected from the 51 strains showing intermediate susceptibility to ABPC to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The MICs of the 6 strains were: 1 microgram/ml to ABPC, 0.25 microgram/ml to PCG, 2 micrograms/ml to cefotaxime (CTX), 0.016 microgram/ml to panipenem (PAPM), and more than 4 micrograms/ml to erythromycin (EM). These 6 strains were distinctly resistant to CTX. Peak concentrations in excess of three to ten times the bactericidal concentrations at the site of infection are associated with the best clinical response. In meningitis caused by GBS whose susceptibility is intermediate or resistant to PCG or ABPC, it is difficult to maintain a sufficient therapeutic concentration in cerebrospinal fluid after the administration of these two agents. It is preferable to use PAPM, because the efficacy and safety of PAPM in the treatment of purulent meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were established in Japan.
TI  - The World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System Proficiency Testing Program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using NCCLS methods.
AB  - A total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the NCCLS testing procedures participated in the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EQAS-AST) from January 1998 through March 2001. Laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga. The results were compared to the results generated at the CDC with the NCCLS broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. Although there were few testing errors with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of Salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136 (91%) of 150 laboratories. In addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the Staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. For a vanB-containing Enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference MIC or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. Of the laboratories that tested Streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. While 110 laboratories (73%) tested the S. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no NCCLS interpretive criteria. Ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an MIC method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. Feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. The positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the EQAS program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. The 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.
TI  - [Meningitis caused by streptococci other than S. pneumoniae: clinical and microbiological features of 13 cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Meningitis caused by streptococci other than S. pneumoniae are uncommon. We present our experience. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We reviewed the clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological features of all patients with meningitis due to streptococci other than S. pneumoniae diagnosed in the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron during the period 1991-2001. RESULTS: Main causative agents in 13 studied patients were viridans group streptococci (6 cases) and S. agalactiae (5 cases). There were no differences in the clinical presentation between different streptococci. Bacteremia was common in meningitis due to S. agalactiae (80%). Only one patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Meningitis caused by streptococci other than S. pneumoniae are often related to a distant focus of infection or to neurosurgical procedures and, in our experience, they seem to have a good outcome.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Group B streptococcal conjugate vaccines.
AB  - Linkage of bacterial capsular polysaccharides to proteins to create conjugate vaccines has had a dramatic impact on the health of children. Although unconjugated polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic in infants and some older children and adults, their covalent coupling with proteins stimulates T cell dependent antigenic recognition that profoundly enhances immunogenicity. In the decade since the introduction and widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugate vaccines in the United States, invasive H influenzae infections have become a rarity in childhood. Similarly, the conjugation of polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae to a derivative of diphtheria toxoid and the addition of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infant immunisation schedules carries with it promise for a similar decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in paediatric patients.
TI  - Adult community acquired bacterial meningitis in a Singaporean teaching hospital. A seven-year overview (1993-2000).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to describe the bacteriological, clinical and laboratory features of community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults admitted to a Singapore tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis admitted between 1993 and 2000 were identified by their discharge diagnosis codes. All case records except for 57 which could not be retrieved were retrospectively reviewed. Patients less than 14 years or with skull fractures, post-neurosurgery or with indwelling intracranial devices were excluded. Inclusion criteria was a clinical picture compatible with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis with either (1) positive cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) cultures or latex coagglutination or CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis accompanied by positive blood cultures or (2) in the absence of positive blood cultures, CSF cultures and latex agglutination, presence of CSF pleocytosis of at least 100 neutrophils per microL. RESULTS: Fifteen "culture-positive" and 11 "culture negative" cases were identified. Six (55%) of the "culture-negative" cases received antibiotics prior to admission. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in four cases, three cases each of Group B streptococci and Neisseria meningitides. Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were each seen twice and Streptococcus suis once. All cases of Group B streptococci occurred in the year 1998. Mortality was 19% (n = 5), six developed infections in other sites, three epileptic seizures, three developed hydrocephalus, and two hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens are similar to those reported in other studies but for an outbreak of Group B Streptococcus in 1998. There were a high number of "culture-negative" cases which may be due to preceding antibiotic intervention.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus).
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common cause of sepsis and meningitis in newborns, and causes disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant adults. The incidence of disease among non-pregnant adults, particularly those with underlying conditions, is increasing. In addition, many individuals are asymptomatically colonized with GBS. When compared to group A Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, however, little is known about the pathogenesis, natural history and transmission dynamics of GBS. Various molecular tools have been utilized to study this organism, including both phenotypic techniques, such as serotyping and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and genotypic techniques such as plasmid analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This review outlines the contributions of these methods to our current understanding of GBS infections.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in France in 1999].
AB  - In France, two sources of data, the mandatory notification and the laboratory network EPIBAC, allow the health authorities to follow the incidence of bacterial meningitis (BM) and to assess the relative frequency of the micro-organisms responsible for such infection. In 1999, more than 1,000 cases of BM were notified in France. The more common micro-organisms were: Streptococcus pneumoniae 46%, Neisseria meningitidis 32% and Streptococcus agalactiae(or Streptococcus B) 11%. Listeria monocytogenes and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 6% and 5% of the cases respectively. In 1999, the incidence per 100,000 inhabitants of meningitis due to pneumococci (0.81), to streptococci B (0.19) and tuberculosis meningitis (0.17) were stable since 1995. The incidence rate of meningitis due to Listeria (0.10) and to H. influenzae (0.08) shows a regular decrease since 1992. The impact of preventive measures of meningitis due to Listeria and H. influenzae B has been clearly demonstrated through the dramatic decrease of meningitis due to these micro-organisms.
TI  - Cellular activation, phagocytosis, and bactericidal activity against group B streptococcus involve parallel myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent and independent signaling pathways.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) vigorously activate inflammatory responses. We reported previously that a secreted GBS "factor" activates phagocytes via Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR6, but that GBS cell walls activate cells independently of these receptors. We hypothesized that the phagocytic immune functions in response to GBS, such as inflammation, uptake, and elimination of bacteria, occur through a coordinated engagement of TLRs, along with the coreceptors CD14 and CD11b/CD18. Using various knockout mice we show that GBS-induced activation of p38 and NF-kappaB depends upon the expression of the cytoplasmic TLR adapter protein, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), but not TLR2 and/or TLR4. Macrophages with deletions of CD14 and complement receptor 3 had a normal cytokine response to whole bacteria, although the response to GBS factor was abrogated in CD14-null cells. The intracellular formation of bactericidal oxygen species proved to be MyD88 dependent; however, uptake of GBS, a prerequisite for intracellular killing by O(2) radicals, occurred independently of MyD88. While deletion of complement receptor 3 greatly diminished the uptake of opsonized GBS, it did not affect the formation of bactericidal O(2) radicals or inflammatory signaling intermediates. We conclude that the inflammatory, bactericidal, and phagocytic responses to GBS occur via parallel but independent processes.
TI  - Complete genome sequence and comparative genomic analysis of an emerging human pathogen, serotype V Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The 2,160,267 bp genome sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae, the leading cause of bacterial sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis in neonates in the U.S. and Europe, is predicted to encode 2,175 genes. Genome comparisons among S. agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and the other completely sequenced genomes identified genes specific to the streptococci and to S. agalactiae. These in silico analyses, combined with comparative genome hybridization experiments between the sequenced serotype V strain 2603 V/R and 19 S. agalactiae strains from several serotypes using whole-genome microarrays, revealed the genetic heterogeneity among S. agalactiae strains, even of the same serotype, and provided insights into the evolution of virulence mechanisms.
TI  - Antibody to streptococcal cysteine proteinase as a seromarker of group A Streptococcal (Streptococcus pyogenes) infections.
AB  - Serological tests are commonly employed to aid the diagnosis of Streptococcus pyogenes infections, particularly when non-suppurative sequelae are suspected. Conventional laboratory practice is to measure antibody levels to various combinations of the extracellular group A Streptococcus (GAS) antigens streptolysin O (SLO), DNase B, streptokinase and hyaluronidase. Antibody to the extracellular cysteine proteinase streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B) and its precursor zymogen is also produced in response to GAS infections. An indirect hemagglutination test for antibody to zymogen/SPE B was established and evaluated in serum samples from 168 patients with proven (n = 27) or suspected GAS (n = 141) infections, which were also screened for antibodies using the 4 conventional tests. For comparison, sera from 56 patients infected with a variety of other pathogens, as well as sera from 16 patients infected with either S. agalactiae or S. pneumoniae and 34 sera from healthy subjects, were tested. Statistical analysis confirmed that antibody to zymogen/SPE B is a serological marker that can discriminate GAS infections. It can be ranked with the anti-SLO titer, currently the most widely used test, as a marker of an antecedent GAS infection.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - Structure and flexibility of Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase complex with its substrate. Insights into the mechanism of processive degradation of hyaluronan.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase degrades primarily hyaluronan, the main polysaccharide component of the host connective tissues, into unsaturated disaccharide units as the end product. Such function of the enzyme destroys the normal connective tissue structure of the host and exposes the tissue cells to various bacterial toxins. The crystal structure of hexasaccharide hyaluronan complex with the S. agalactiae hyaluronate lyase was determined at 2.2 A resolution; the mechanism of the catalytic process, including the identification of specific residues involved in the degradation of hyaluronan, was clearly identified. The enzyme is composed structurally and functionally from two distinct domains, an alpha-helical alpha-domain and a beta-sheet beta-domain. The flexibility of the protein was investigated by comparing the crystal structures of the S. agalactiae and the Streptococcus pneumoniae enzymes, and by using essential dynamics analyses of CONCOORD computer simulations. These revealed important modes of flexibility, which could be related to the protein function. First, a rotation/twist of the alpha-domain relative to the beta-domain is potentially related to the mechanism of processivity of the enzyme; this twist motion likely facilitates shifting of the ligand along the catalytic site cleft in order to reposition it to be ready for further cleavage. Second, a movement of the alpha- and beta-domains with respect to each other was found to contribute to a change in electrostatic characteristics of the enzyme and appears to facilitate binding of the negatively charged hyaluronan ligand. Third, an opening/closing of the substrate binding cleft brings a catalytic histidine closer to the cleavable substrate beta1,4-glycosidic bond. This opening/closing mode also reflects the main conformational difference between the crystal structures of the S. agalactiae and the S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyases.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2000).
AB  - Susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahS) and viridans group (VgS) streptococci in the four regions of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program: Asia-Pacific (APAC), Europe (EU), Latin America (LA) and North America (NA). In 1997 through 2000, SENTRY Program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria. Among the betahS processed, 81.9% of strains were either Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or S. agalactiae (n = 1,190). The VgS were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or S. mitis (n = 254; 22%). Seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (ER), clindamycin (CM), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), vancomycin (VA), teicoplanin (TP) and linezolid (LZ) were tested. Rank order of susceptibility for betahS isolates was: ceftriaxone (CTX) = Q/D = VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (GATI) = trovafloxacin (TROV, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (LEVO; 99.7%) > penicillin (PEN; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (GREPA; 97.4%) > CM (94.4%) > ER (85.5%). ER versus betahS had the highest MIC(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in NA to 97.3% in LA). Among the VgS, susceptibility rank order was: VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > Q/D (99.1%) > GATI = LEVO = TROVA (98.0%) > GREPA (96.5%) > CTX (92.8%) > CM (90.3%) > PEN (68.6%) > ER (64.5%). Macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the M-phenotype was highest in the Americas, with erm-patterns predominating in EU and APAC regions. BMS284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. Like Streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.
TI  - Trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  - Milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University, for bacteriologic culture. A total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards. Isolates included in this study were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcesens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. However, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of S. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. For Strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. For Strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. For Strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. Among E. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. Among K pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. Overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacterial meningitis and invasive non-meningitic bacterial disease in scotland during the period 1983-99.
AB  - We reviewed population-based laboratory reports of invasive meningococcal, pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Listeria monocytogenes isolates in order to examine the changing epidemiology of meningitis and invasive non-meningitic disease (INMD) caused by these 5 pathogens in the 2 periods before (1983-91) and after (1992-99) routine use of H. influenzae type B conjugate vaccine (Hib) in Scotland. Neissieria meningitidis was the most common cause of meningitis, accounting for 39.2% of cases of meningitis in 1983-91 and 47% of cases in 1992-99, followed by H. influenzae (31%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.4%), GBS (3.9%) and L. monocytogenes (3.5%) in 1983-91 and S. pneumoniae (36.3%), H. influenzae (7.8%), GBS (6.1%) and L. monocytogenes (2.8%) in 1992-99. The important epidemiological features of meningitis and INMD caused by these 5 pathogens between 1983-91 and 1992-99 include: 1. The incidence of bacterial meningitis due to S. pneumoniae and GBS was stable; 2. S. pneumoniae was the predominant cause of INMD in both periods; 3. The incidences of INMD caused by N. meningitidis, GBS and S. pneumoniae increased, by 27%, 55% and 56%, respectively; 4. Decreases in the incidences of bacterial meningitis (by 50%) and INMD (by 50%) due to L. monocytogenes were detected; and 5. There were dramatic reductions in the proportions of bacterial meningitis (by 92%) and INMD (by 56%) due to H. influenzae in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. Continued surveillance is necessary to monitor the disease trend, population at risk, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility in order to implement appropriate public health interventions against invasive bacterial disease.
TI  - Capsulate bacteria and the lung.
AB  - Capsulate bacteria cause the majority of community-acquired pneumonia presenting  to hospital world-wide, at all ages. They are united by the virulence factor of their differing capsular polysaccharides, enabling them to evade phagocytosis. All cause invasive disease beyond the respiratory tract, including septicaemia and central nervous system infection. Recent advances in vaccine development have made the capsular polysaccharide an achievable target for vaccine strategies across all ages, with impacts already seen upon Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumonia in countries able to afford these new vaccines.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. Among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (CPs) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. In the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. The capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the CP of Streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. A more complex situation has been found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. On the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. Streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. This concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.
TI  - Type III group B streptococcal polysaccharide induces antibodies that cross-react with Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14.
AB  - Covalent linkage of a bacterial polysaccharide to a protein greatly enhances the  carbohydrate's immunogenicity and its binding to solid surfaces in immunoassays. These findings have spurred the development of glycoconjugate vaccines to prevent serious bacterial infections as well as the use of glycoconjugates as coating antigens in bioassays. We evaluated sera from women immunized with unconjugated group B streptococcal (GBS) type III (GBS III) polysaccharide (IIIPS) or with IIIPS covalently linked to tetanus toxoid to assess specificity, sensitivity, and parallelism in dilution curves in two GBS III enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). One assay used IIIPS mixed with methylated human serum albumin (IIIPS + mHSA) as the coating antigen, and the other used IIIPS covalently linked to HSA (III-HSA). Each coating antigen was associated with a highly specific GBS III bioassay. The sensitivity was higher in the III-HSA ELISA, in which conjugated IIIPS is bound to the plates. Parallelism in titration curves was observed in the III-HSA but not in the IIIPS + mHSA ELISA. The excellent correlation between the concentrations of GBS IIIPS-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the opsonophagocytic activity of these antibodies indicated that the III-HSA assay can predict functionality of vaccine-induced IgG against GBS III disease. The structure of the repeating unit of the capsular polysaccharide of GBS III differs from that of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 (Pn14 PS) only by the presence on GBS III of a sialic acid residue at the end of the side chain. The majority of healthy adults responding to GBS III vaccines with a fourfold or greater increase in GBS III-specific IgG antibodies developed antibodies cross-reacting with Pn14 PS (i.e., desialylated GBS IIIPS). The proportion of GBS vaccine responders who developed IgG to the desialylated IIIPS did not depend on whether IIIPS was given in the unconjugated or conjugated form. When present, these vaccine-induced cross-reacting antibodies conferred in vitro antibody-mediated opsonophagocytosis and killing of both GBS III and Pn14, two pathogens that cause invasive disease in young infants.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations and time-kill determination of moxifloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic isolates.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a new oral 8-methoxy-quinolone with a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, atypical micro-organisms and multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. This study was designed to assess the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria with different resistance patterns, anaerobes and atypical micro-organisms such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma. Moxifloxacin had good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae with all strains inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of moxifloxacin for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae ranged from 0.03 to 0.5 mg/l while those of ciprofloxacin were about two- to four-fold higher (MICs=0.12-1 mg/l). Moxifloxacin was poorly active against enterococci but its activity against Clostridium and Bacteroides spp. was in the same range as that of metronidazole and superior to that of clindamycin. Moxifloxacin was substantially more active than both ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Chlamydia.
TI  - [Treatment of acute bacterial meningitis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute bacterial meningitis requires immediate antimicrobial therapy.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Guidelines to antimicrobial treatment of children and adults with acute bacterial meningitis are presented. RESULTS: The most common agents causing acute bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus agalactiae in children less than one month of age, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis in individuals more than one month of age. If the causative bacterial agent is not known, children below one month of age should be given ampicillin and gentamicin, whereas older children and adults should be given benzylpenicillin in combination with either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. We suggest treatment with specific antibiotic regimens in cases of known aetiology.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis: current controversies in approaches to treatment.
AB  - Acute bacterial meningitis continues to be a disease with unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates in both adults and children worldwide, despite advances in antibacterial therapy. Death or permanent disability occurs frequently. The causative organism varies with age, immune function and immunisation status. Infection with Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is associated with the majority of cases, with Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae being more prevalent pathogens at the extremes of age (<3 months or >50 years). Antibacterial resistance is an increasing problem, particularly in pneumococcal bacteria but increasingly in other organisms. The increasing prevalence of resistance of pneumococcus to penicillin and the cephalosporins complicates therapy and may have an important impact on treatment outcome. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology has allowed advances in diagnosis and therapy. The use of adjunctive corticosteroids remains controversial, but is probably beneficial in reducing neurological sequelae in children. In adults the evidence is less clear. Vaccination has virtually eradicated Hib meningitis in some countries. Recent introduction of a conjugate vaccine against serogroup C meningococci in the UK has caused a dramatic reduction in the incidence of invasive disease due to this organism. A 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine promises a similar reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. In the meantime, the emergence of widespread resistance of organisms to antibacterial agents, in particular among the common organisms causing bacterial meningitis, remains the biggest challenge in therapy.
TI  - Streptococcal meningitis in adults: therapeutic outcomes and prognostic factors.
AB  - Thirty-eight patients with streptococcal meningitis, aged 17-75 years, have been  identified over a period of 13.5 years. Among these 38 patients, 35 had community-acquired infections, and the other three had nosocomial infections. Twelve of the 38 patients were found to have postneurosurgical forms and 26 to have spontaneous forms. These 38 cases of streptococci included Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae in 19 cases, viridans group streptococci in 13, non-A, non-B, and non-D streptococci in three, Group D streptococci in one, and Group B streptococci (S. agalactiae) in two. Although one case was found to have penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae PRSP in 1994, multi-antibiotic resistant strains were rare in this study. Therapeutic outcomes varied according to the different species of streptococci. In this study, the overall mortality rate was 34%. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only initial consciousness level and the presence of seizure were strongly associated with the mortality rate even after other potentially confounding factors were adjusted for. Early diagnosis and the use of appropriate antibiotics are essential for survival.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - Serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility of group B Streptococcus over an eight-year period in southern Taiwan.
AB  - The increase in penicillin resistance among pneumococci and viridans streptococci and the development of serotype-specific conjugate vaccine have increased the need for knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility and the capsular serotypes of group B streptococci. Over an 8-year period, 351 group B streptococcal isolates from southern Taiwan were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype determination. Eighty-seven percent of the isolates were typeable. Types III (28.5%) and V (27.1%) were the most common serotypes. The occurrence of type V isolates increased with age, while that of type III isolates decreased with age, showing a predominance in children less than 1 year of age. Of 118 isolates from cases of invasive infection, types Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V accounted for 12.7, 11.9, 0.8, 33, 1.7, and 26.3%, respectively. Using the agar dilution method, all isolates were found to be susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, and vancomycin, 99.4% to ofloxacin, 78.1% to chloramphenicol, 63.2% to azithromycin, 62.6% to erythromycin, 57.3% to clindamycin, and 2.8% to tetracycline. Chloramphenicol resistance was associated with type III isolates (59 of 100, 59%) and erythromycin and azithromycin resistance with type Ib isolates (25 of 33 176%], and 21 of 33 [64%], respectively). Thus, 72% of the isolates from invasive infections were serotype III, V, or Ia, and penicillin remains the drug of choice for treatment or prophylaxis of group B streptococcal infections in southern Taiwan, despite the high prevalence of penicillin resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Prevention of perinatal infection caused by group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus].
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae strains or group B streptococci (GBS) are the leading cause of bacterial pneumoniae, sepsis and meningitis in neonates. GBS is also a major cause of bacteriemia in pregnant women. Colonization of the human rectovaginal tract with GBS is a risk factor associated with chorioamnionitis and transmission of the infection to the infant. Neonatal exposure to high concentrations of GBS, mainly during vaginal delivery, leads to colonisation of the lung airways and subsequent onset of severe diseases like pneumonia, sepsis and menigitis. GBS is present in the genitourinary tract of 10% to 40% of pregnant women, about 50% of the newborns of these mothers will be colonised during delivery and of these neonates, 1% to 2% present a severe invasive disease. The early-onset disease, appear in the neonates within 7 days of life and more than 90% occur within the first day of life. Fatal infection is associated commonly with fulminat and overwhelming early-onset disease. Maternal-intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is able to prevent the transmission of GBS to the newborn and to reduce the frequency and the severity of early onset disease. In many countries, in particular in US, several recommendations have been proposed to prevent the perinatal GBS infection. In this paper some recommendations to prevent GBS disease of the newborn, performed in collaboration with Italian Society of Perinatal Medicine, are presented. The most important problem in the prevention programme is the identification of the cases to treat, since it is not possible to give antibiotics to all the women. We combine two strategies for the identification of the women to be treated, one risk based and the other screening based. Intra-partum administration of ampicillin or penicillin is recommended for the women with one or more risk-factors (labour < 37 weeks of gestation, duration of ruptured membranes > = 18 hours, intrapartum temperature > = 38 degrees C, previous infant with invasive GBS disease, diabetes) and for women with collect vaginal and rectal swab for GBS culture at 36-38 weeks' gestation, positive for GBS. No treatment is required for the babies of women intrapartum treated or with negative culture performed near term. Treatment with ampicillin is necessary, only in the new-borns of women with incomplete or unknown results or not done cultures and in those born from mothers with positive cultures, but not intrapartum treated. Collection of swabs for GBS is recommended before antibiotic administration. If the culture is negative, we suggest to stop the antibiotic therapy, otherwise the treatment must be continuated for 5-7 days. In conclusion, a written protocol for prevention of GBS infection in new-born must be adopted in every delivery centre and one possible protocol is proposed in this paper.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - Nationwide German multicenter study on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in streptococcal blood isolates from neutropenic patients and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobials.
AB  - In a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. Streptococcus oralis (26.3%), S. pneumoniae (26.3%), S. agalactiae (11.5%), S. mitis (9%), and S. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. Four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. One strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (MIC, 8 mg/liter). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among S. oralis (14.6%), S. mitis (7.1%), and S. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes. Resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%. Quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; MIC(90), 1 mg/liter, MIC range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).
TI  - Mutually exclusive distribution of IS1548 and GBSi1, an active group II intron identified in human isolates of group B streptococci.
AB  - The present study shows that active, self-splicing group II intron GBSi1 is located downstream of the C5a-peptidase gene, scpB, in some group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates that lack insertion sequence IS1548. IS1548 was previously reported to be often present at the scpB locus in GBS isolated in association with endocarditis. Since none of 67 GBS isolates examined, 40 of which were of serotype III, harbored both IS1548 and GBSi1, these two elements are suggested to be markers for different genetic lineages in GBS serotype III. The DNA region downstream of scpB in GBS isolates harboring either GBSi1, IS1548, or none of these mobile elements was found to encode the laminin binding protein, Lmb, which shows sequence similarities to a family of streptococcal adhesins. IS1548 is inserted 9 bp upstream of the putative promoter for lmb, while the insertion site for GBSi1 is located 88 bp further upstream. Sequences highly similar to GBSi1 exist also in Streptococcus pneumoniae. An inverted repeat sequence, with features typical of transcription terminators, was identified immediately upstream of the insertion site for the group II intron both in the GBS and S. pneumoniae sequences. This motif is suggested to constitute a target for the GBS intron as well as for rather closely related introns in Bacillus halodurans, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, and Pseudomonas putida. When transcripts containing the GBSi1 intron were incubated at high concentrations of ammonium and magnesium, a major product with the expected length and sequence for the ligated exons was generated. Unlike, however, all members of group II investigated so far, the excised intron was in linear, rather than in a branched (lariat), form.
TI  - [A comparative study of antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin against clinical isolates].
AB  - Ceftibuten is an orally active third generation new cephalosporin. Its antibacterial activity in vitro was tested to many clinical isolates and was compared to the activity of ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin, by twofold serial dilution method in Muller-Hinton agar--detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and by the disc-diffusion method of Kirby-Bauer. The new cephalosporin demonstrated great activity against the different clinical important strains. Many resistant strains to ampicillin were high susceptible to ceftibuten. The majority of Gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacteriaceae, the respiratory pathogens M.(B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae are highly susceptible to Ceftibuten, however Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter are resistant. The majority of methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus are resistant too. New cephallosporin was also active against S. pyogenes (Streptococcus gr. A) and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, but was inactive against S. agalactiae (Streptococcus gr. B), S. pneumoniae penicillin-resistant strains and enterococci, similar to the other cephalosporins. The activity of ceftibuten was higher than that of ampicillin and cefuroxime against beta-lactamases positive strains of H. influenzae and M.(B) catarrhalis, also against tested strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The major priority of the new antibacterial agent over other cephalosporins and ampicillin is its stability to hydrolysis by the main broad-spectrum beta-lactamases producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae sp.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro Activity of Cefprozil Relative to Other Oral Antimicrobial Agents Against Bacteria in Clinical Specimens from Patients in Sao Paulo With Respiratory Tract Infections.
AB  - Cefprozil is a new oral second generation cephalosporin. Its in vitro antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 371 recent clinical isolates from patients with respiratory infections. We tested the susceptibility of 244 streptococci (96 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 105 group viridans streptococci, 32 Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 group A beta-hemolitic streptococci) 107 Haemophilus influenzae, and 20 oxacillin-susceptible S.aureus (OSSA). The isolates were susceptibility tested against cefprozil, cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid by the E-test method; and against cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cefetamet, erythromycin, and azythromycin by disk diffusion. The methods and the susceptibility categorization followed the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) procedures. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was slightly more active againstH.influenzae (MICs(90) 0.5microg/mL) than cefprozil or cefaclor (MICs(90) 4 and 2microg/mL respectively). Cefprozil demonstrated potent activity against streptococci. Against S.pneumoniae, cefprozil was 2-4 fold more active than cefaclor (MICs(90)0.125 and 0.38microg/mL, respectively). S. pneumoniae susceptibility was 84% to penicillin, 95% to erythromycin and 97% to azithromycin by disk diffusion. Viridans streptococci showed higher MICs for cefprozil and cefaclor (MICs(90) 4microg/mL and 8microg/mL, respectively) and only 50% susceptibility to the macrolides. Cefprozil was four times more active than cefaclor and as active as amoxieillin/clavulanic acid against group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and S.agalactiae. These three compounds showed similar activity against OSSA. In conclusion, cefprozil demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against bacterial species responsible for respiratory infections in Sao Paulo.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Group B streptococcal meningitis in adults: recent increase in Southeast Asia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is rare in adults and usually affects patients with predisposing conditions. AIMS: To describe an increase in adult group B streptococcal meningitis occurring in parallel in Hong Kong and Singapore. METHODS: All cases of bacterial meningitis admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong and Singapore General Hospital in 1998, aged 15 years or above, were reviewed. Medical records for the previous ten years were searched for previous cases of adult group B streptococcal meningitis. RESULTS: In 1998, 29 adult patients with bacterial meningitis were admitted to the two hospitals. S. agalactiae was isolated in 11 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in three cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases, and Pseudomonas pseudomallei in one case. In 11 cases no bacteriological diagnosis could be made. Two patients with adult group B streptococcal meningitis had predisposing conditions for infection. One patient died before a definite diagnosis could be established. A ten year review of records revealed one previous case of adult group B streptococcal meningitis in a patient with multiple risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of group B streptococcal meningitis has occurred among adults admitted to two major hospitals in two Southeast Asian cities. In the majority of cases there were no identifiable predisposing conditions. The cause of this increase of group B streptococcal remains unclear.
TI  - [National multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens. Spanish Study Group on Moxifloxacin].
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [National Multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens]
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant streptococci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the new agents linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin were determined and compared with those of penicillin, clindamycin, and four macrolides against 53 erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 117 S. pyogenes (64 erythromycin-susceptible and 53 -resistant), and 101 S. agalactiae (53 erythromycin-susceptible and 48 -resistant) isolates. Differentiation of macrolide resistance phenotypes was performed by the double-disk method. The genetic basis for macrolide resistance in 52 strains was also determined. The M phenotype was found in 84.9, 6.3, and 1.9% of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. These strains were susceptible to miocamycin and clindamycin. Strains with the inducible phenotype accounted for 27.1% of S. agalactiae isolates and 9.4% each of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae isolates. All erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to the 14- and 15-membered macrolides tested. Strains with all three phenotypes were susceptible to </=2 microgram of linezolid per ml. Quinupristin-dalfopristin exhibited good in vitro activity against all strains, irrespective of their resistance to erythromycin (MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.2 to 1 microgram/ml). Against the erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae strains, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were the most active agents (MIC(90)s, 0.1 microgram/ml). The new antimicrobials evaluated may be alternative agents to treat infections caused by macrolide-resistant as well as macrolide-susceptible streptococci.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1994 and 1998].
AB  - We evaluated 82 children with bacterial meningitis in 78 institutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1994 and 1998. The mean number of cases per year was 16.4 (range, 9 to 30). A male predominance occurred with 52 males and 30 females (1.7:1). Median age was 11 months with a range from 1 day to 11 years. Seventy-eight (95%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 55 (67%) less than 2 years old and 45 (55%) less than 1-year old. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case fatality rate of 4.9%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 29%, predominantly sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy and development delay of varying severity. The main causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae in 49 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 14, Streptococcus agalactiae in 10 and Escherichia coli in 5. The frequency of poor prognosis was 50% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae or S. agalactiae compared with 27% for patients with meningitis due to H. influenzae.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  - An optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, Clostridium bifermentans and C. sordellii, and Prevotella bivia. Serial electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. Four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. Thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. The analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. The method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of S. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. Since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced Gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some Gram-positive organisms. We compared the in vitro activity of these compounds against 4151 Gram-negative and -positive organisms. Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. All compounds were highly active (overall) against Gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that the advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The extracellular hyaluronidase gene (hylA) of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Group A streptococci produce an extracellular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate lyase) which may be associated with the spread of the organism during infection. The gene for this hyaluronidase (hylA) encodes an 868 amino acid protein with a molecular size of 99636 Da. Cleavage of the proposed signal peptide results in an extracellular protein of 95941 Da. Comparison with other bacterial hyaluronidases indicates strong similarities to the genes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. A region internal to the hylA gene was amplified from all 175 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested suggesting a widespread distribution of the gene.
TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  - From 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the insertion sequence IS1381 in group B Streptococci.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are typed by capsular polysaccharide type. IS1381, an  insertion sequence previously described in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was cloned from GBS strain A909. The presence of multiple copies of IS1381 in A909 suggested that IS1381 analysis might be an effective subtyping tool. IS1381 was found by Southern blot analysis to be present in 18 (72%) of 25 of unrelated GBS isolates tested. IS1381 analysis allowed discrimination between strains that contain IS1381 with a discriminatory power >99%. Eight of 8 sets of epidemiologically related isolates containing IS1381 give identical or nearly identical patterns of IS1381 insertion. For 2 maternal/infant sets, a single additional insertion was seen in 1 strain, suggesting that an additional insertion occurred between maternal colonization and infection of the infant. Insertion patterns of IS1381 are an effective tool for subtyping GBS.
TI  - [Meningitis (II)--acute bacterial meningitis].
AB  - Acute meningitis is a medical emergency, particularly in patients with rapidly progressing disease, mental status changes or neurological deficits. The majority of cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by a limited number of species, i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitis, Listeria monocytogenes, group B Streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae. Many other pathogens can occasionally cause bacterial meningitis, often under special clinical circumstances. Treatment of meningitis includes two main goals: Eradication of the infecting organism, and management of CNS and systemic complications. Empiric therapy should be initiated without delay, as the prognosis of the disease depends on the time when therapy is started. One or two blood cultures should be obtained before administering the first antibiotic. Empiric therapy is primarily based on the age of the patient, with modifications if there are positive findings on CSF gram stain or if the patient presents with special risk factors. It is safer to choose regimens with broad coverage, as they can usually be modified within 24-48 hours, when antibiotic sensitivities of the infecting organism become available. Adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone is also administered in severely ill patients concomitantly with the first antibiotic dose. In patients who are clinically stable and are unlikely to be adversely affected if antibiotics are not administered immediately, including those with suspected viral or chronic meningitis, a lumbar puncture represents the first step, unless there is clinical suspicion of an intracerebral mass lesion. Findings in the CSF and on CT scan, if performed, will guide the further diagnostic work-up and therapy in all patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Etiology of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in infants younger than three months of age in Ethiopia.
AB  - METHODS: Within a multicenter study coordinated by WHO, an investigation of the etiologic agents of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis was performed among infants younger than 3 months of age seen at the Ethio-Swedish Children's Hospital in Addis Ababa for a period of 2 years. Of the 816 infants enrolled 405 had clinical indications for investigation. RESULTS: There were a total of 41 isolates from blood cultures from 40 infants. The study showed that the traditionally known acute respiratory infection pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae was most common in this extended neonatal age group, found in 10 of 41 blood isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes was a common pathogen in this setting (9 of 41 blood isolates), whereas Salmonella group B was found in 5 of 41 isolates. Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a common pathogen in developed countries, was absent. A study of the susceptibility pattern of these organisms suggests that a combination of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside is adequate for initial treatment of these serious bacterial infections, but the combination is not optimal for the treatment of Salmonella infections. Among 202 infants on whom immunofluorescent antibody studies for viruses were performed based on nasopharyngeal aspirates, respiratory syncytial virus was found in 57 (28%) infants, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 32 (15.8%) of 203 infants.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - V2 regions of 16S ribosomal RNA used as a molecular marker for the species identification of streptococci in peripheral blood and synovial fluid from patients with psoriatic arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of 3 streptococcal species in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection targets bacterial 16S rRNA, which is present in bacteria at high copy numbers. The 3 species-specific primers for group A streptococci (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes), group B streptococci (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were designed from the fragments of highly variable V2 regions of 16S rRNA. Total RNA was prepared from whole peripheral blood and joint fluid obtained from patients with PsA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All positive PCR reactions were then sequenced with a Pharmacia ALF DNA sequencing system. RESULTS: Our data in 19 PsA patients showed that 7 peripheral blood samples were positive for GAS (P = 0.006 versus GAS-positive RA patients [n = 0], by Fisher's exact test), and 2 were also positive for GBS. One synovial fluid sample from a PsA patient was positive for GAS. S pneumoniae was absent from all specimens. Seventeen patients with RA were PCR negative for the 3 streptococcal species. Peripheral blood from a patient with inflammatory bowel disease was positive for GAS. CONCLUSION: The presence of GAS 16S rRNA in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with PsA supports the concept that PsA is a reactive arthritis to certain streptococci.
TI  - Ozonolytic depolymerization of polysaccharides in aqueous solution.
AB  - The selective oxidation of beta-D-glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides by ozone has great utility as a general method for depolymerization of polysaccharides. Here we describe a 'one-step' method whereby polysaccharides dissolved in water or basic solutions are depolymerized by ozonolysis. The oxidation of glycosidic linkages of unprotected carbohydrates by ozone is complicated by several side reactions. We describe here optimized conditions for carrying out ozonolysis degradation. We also characterize the major pathways for unwanted degradation by various side reactions. In the preferred oxidation pathway, the aldosidic linkage is oxidized to an aldonic ester function that hydrolyzes under the basic conditions employed to give a free aldonate, with cleavage of the polysaccharide chain. Nonselective degradation pathways include oxidative degradation by radical species that oxidize glycosyl residues to formic, acetic, and oxalic acids. The nonselective degradation caused by acids is minimized by basic buffers. The products of polysaccharide depolymerization form a size distribution around a nominal molecular weight, and the average molecular weight of the products can be controlled by the rate or amount of ozone passed through the reaction mixture. The ozonolysis method described herein provides a convenient, inexpensive, and controllable means for generating small polysaccharides or large oligosaccharide fragments.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Molecular characterization of type-specific capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis  genes of Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia.
AB  - The type-specific capsular polysaccharide (CP) of a group B streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia, is a high-molecular-weight polymer consisting of the pentasaccharide repeating unit 4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1- ->3 )]-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1. Here, cloning, sequencing, and transcription of the type Ia-specific capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) genes and functional analysis of these gene products are described. A 26-kb DNA fragment containing 18 complete open reading frames (ORFs) was cloned. These ORFs were designated cpsIaA to cpsIaL, neu (neuraminic acid synthesis gene) A to D, orf1 and ung (uracil DNA glycosylase). The cps gene products of S. agalactiae type Ia were homologous to proteins involved in CP synthesis of S. agalactiae type III and S. pneumoniae serotype 14. Unlike the cps gene cluster of S. pneumoniae serotype 14, transcription of this operon may start from cpsIaA, cpsIaE, and orf1 because putative promoter sequences were found in front of these genes. Northern hybridization, reverse transcription-PCR, and primer extension analyses supported this hypothesis. DNA sequence analysis showed that there were two transcriptional terminators in the 3' end of this operon (downstream of orf1 and ung). The functions of CpsIaE, CpsIaG, CpsIaI, and CpsIaJ were examined by glycosyltransferase assay by using the gene products expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 harboring plasmids containing various S. agalactiae type Ia cps gene fragments. Enzyme assays suggested that the gene products of cpsIaE, cpsIaG, cpsIaI, and cpsIaJ are putative glucosyltransferase, beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase, beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, respectively.
TI  - Streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  - Streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. We report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). The patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. Nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. Causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; Streptococcus agalactiae, 3; Streptococcus bovis, 2; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 1. Four Streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (MIC, 0.5-2 microg/mL). Five patients (17%) died. The infection is increasing in the hospital setting. Streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. In cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the Streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in the newborn: a prospective study of mortality and morbidity.
AB  - Neonatal bacterial meningitis is a serious disease around the world, with the incidence changing little in the past 30 years. Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae are common causative organisms and lumbar puncture remains the definitive method of diagnosis. The mortality rate has declined in industrialized countries over the years, from almost 50% in the 1970s to less than 10% in 1997. However, neurological sequelae are still frequently observed despite major changes in treatment. Preliminary analysis of our own data from a prospective study of cases in the United Kingdom suggests that treatment with third generation cephalosporins is related to a decrease in mortality but not morbidity.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - Maternal immunization.
AB  - Maternal immunization can enhance passive immunity of infants to pathogens that cause life-threatening illnesses. In most instances, immunization during pregnancy will provide important protection for the woman as well as for her offspring. The tetanus toxoid and influenza vaccines are examples of vaccines that provide a double benefit. Other vaccines under evaluation include those for respiratory syncytial virus, pneumococci, group B streptococci, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Although most IgG antibody crosses the placenta in the third trimester, the process is time-dependent, dictating that immunization should be accomplished ideally at least 6 weeks prior to delivery. IgG1 antibodies are transferred preferentially. Maternal immunization has not interfered with active immunization of the infant. Inactivated vaccines administered in the third trimester of pregnancy pose no known risk to the woman or to her fetus.
TI  - Evaluation of an extended diagnostic PCR assay for detection and verification of  the common causes of bacterial meningitis in CSF and other biological samples.
AB  - A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assay was evaluated for detection and verification of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Steptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other biological samples. A general bacterial amplicon from the 16S rRNA gene was amplified in a first step, and species-specific regions in a second. The detection level was 4 fg DNA/reaction, corresponding to about one bacterial genome per reaction tube. Sample preparations (Dynabeads DNA DIRECT kit) were assayed from 140 bacterial strains suspended in saline. In CSF the detection level for bacteria was 10(3)CFU ml-1for N. meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, 10(4)CFU ml-1for Escherichia coli and 10(5)CFU ml-1for S. agalactiae and L. monocytogenes. The detection levels for these bacteria were the same in the other tested biological samples, like blood with or without culture media. Clinical CSF samples were evaluated from 71 patients with proven bacterial meningitis, as were 61 CSF samples from individuals without bacterial meningitis. The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay in detecting bacteria in general was 0.97, and for the specific species in the clinical CSF samples 0.87-0.94. The specificity was 1.0 for detecting bacteria in general. Some cross-reactions were noted within the streptococcus group. The PCR results were verified by banding patterns of Hae III digested PCR products.
TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - Standardization may suffice for licensure of conjugate vaccines.
AB  - Standardization schemes devised by Control Agencies have followed clinical trials of experimental vaccines. The wealth of information about the pathogenesis of and immunity to bacteria, whose surface polysaccharides are protective antigens, now permits standardization to predict the efficacy of polysaccharide-based vaccines. There has been tacit acceptance of this notion with the licensure of groups Y and W135 meningococcal vaccines and of many of the pneumococcal types whose frequency in patients was too low for statistical significance to be assigned for their clinical efficacy. In fact, this was also the case for licensure of polio virus type 2 vaccine. We can reliably measure the level of anti-polysaccharide antibodies for meningococci, pneumococci, GBS and the Vi of S. typhi. Haemophilus type b conjugates have been reliably standardized by physico-chemical assays. New conjugates, therefore, may be licensed by data provided by standardization without awaiting the results of costly and time-consuming efficacy trials. Adoption of this scientifically-based approach to licensure will hasten the implementation of new and more effective vaccines.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in pediatric field].
AB  - A drug susceptibility test of the combination drug TAZ/PIPC, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (PIPC), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. The clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. The results were as follows: 1. In susceptibility test, 114 strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, penicillin G (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ). Of three clinically isolated species from patients, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was treated with TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, methicillin (DMPPC), CTM, CTX, and SBT/CPZ, and the others were treated with the same drugs except for DMPPC. The MICs were measured for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC90 values of TAZ/PIPC against 45 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of Gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC for 28 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC. The MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 31 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Regarding Gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 2 strains of S. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTM, and CTX, and the latter was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Of 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of PIPC, SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of H. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were similar to those of PIPC and SBT/CPZ. While the MIC of TAZ/PIPC against the high beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of SBT/CPZ and smaller than that of PIPC. 2. The results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: TAZ/PIPC was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). No case with no response was seen in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. Bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of them were eradicated. 4. Adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of 33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. Of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Biochemical profile showed an increase in GPT alone and abnormal increases in both GOT and GPT in 1 each out of 21 cases.
TI  - Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections.
AB  - GABHS is the most common bacterial cause of tonsillopharyngitis, but this organism also produces acute otitis media; pneumonia; skin and soft-tissue infections; cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic infections; bacteremia; and meningitis. Most children and adolescents who develop a sore throat do not have GABHS as the cause; their infection is viral in etiology. Other bacterial pathogens produce sore throat infrequently (e.g., Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae), and when they do, other concomitant clinical illness is present. Classic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis has an acute onset; produces concurrent headache, stomach ache, and dysphagia; and upon examination is characterized by intense tonsillopharyngeal erythema, yellow exudate, and tender/enlarged anterior cervical glands. Unfortunately only about 20% to 30% of patients present with classic disease. Physicians overdiagnose streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis by a wide margin, which almost always leads to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. Accordingly, use of throat cultures and/or rapid GABHS detection tests in the office is strongly advocated. Their use has been shown to be cost-effective and to reduce antibiotic overprescribing substantially. Penicillin currently is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association as first-line therapy for GABHS infections; erythromycin is recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Virtually all patients improve clinically with penicillin and other antibiotics. However, penicillin treatment failures do occur, especially in tonsillopharyngitis in which 5% to 35% of patients do not experience bacteriologic eradication. Penicillin treatment failures are more common among patients who have been treated recently with the drug. Cephalosporins or azithromycin are preferred following penicillin treatment failures in selected patients as first-line therapy, based on a history of penicillin failures or lack of compliance and for impetigo. GABHS remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin in vitro. There are several explanations for penicillin treatment failures, but the possibility of copathogen co-colonization in vivo has received the most attention. Treatment duration with penicillin should be 10 days to optimize cure in GABHS infections. A 5-day regimen is possible and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for cefpodoxime (a cephalosporin) and azithromycin (a macrolide). Prevention of rheumatic fever is the primary objective for antibiotic therapy of GABHS infections, but a reduction in contagion and faster clinical improvement also can be achieved. Development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis ("flesh-eating bacteria") are rising concerns. The portal of entry for these invasive GABHS strains is far more often skin and soft tissue than the tonsillopharynx.
TI  - Acute bacterial meningitis in children admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi in 1996-97.
AB  - To design appropriate interventions, we collected clinical and demographic data prospectively on all children aged one day to 14 years admitted with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (BM) from April 1st 1996 to March 31st 1997 to the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Blantyre, Malawi. During the study period 267 children (2.7% of all paediatric admissions) were found to have BM; 83% were under 5 years of age, 61% under one year and 23% under one month. The most common causative organisms in the post neonatal period (n=206) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) 21%, and Salmonella typhimurium (6%). In the neonatal group (< 1 month, n=61) the most common causes were Streptococcus agalactiae (23%), S. typhimurium (15%), S. pneumoniae (11.5%) and other Gram negative rods (11.5%). Nineteen of 21 salmonella infections were in children under one year of age and all S. agalactiae were in infants under three months. There was delay on presentation: the average length of fever was 4.6 days, 39.5% had convulsed prior to arrival and 57% had an altered level of consciousness. An initial diagnosis of malaria had probably contributed to the delay in 22.5% (42 of 186 tested). 48% were < 80% weight for age, with 18% < 60%) weight for age. The overall mortality was 40%. The outcome was worst in salmonella infections, particularly neonatal salmonella BM with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 89% (8 of 9 cases). Coma on presentation worsened prognosis (mortality 64% if Blantyre Coma Score < 3, 26% if > 3). 15% of survivors had sequelae on discharge. 20% of Hib isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, but all salmonellae were sensitive. 5% of S. pneumoniae were resistant to penicillin and 8% to chloramphenicol. Earlier access to adequate health care and awareness of BM in a malaria-endemic area would reduce mortality and morbidity. Vaccination against Hib infection would have reduced death by 18 (17%) and prevented sequelae in 7 cases.
TI  - Inhibition of group B streptococcal growth by IFN gamma-activated human glioblastoma cells.
AB  - Group B streptococci are the most important bacteria inducing neonatal septicemia and meningitis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of IFNgamma in the induction of anti-microbial effector mechanisms in human brain tumor cells. Different human glioblastoma/astrocytoma cell lines, stimulated with IFNgamma, restricted the growth of group B streptococci. In addition, we found that TNF alpha is able to enhance the IFNgamma-mediated anti-microbial effect. In contrast to group B streptococci, other bacteria which are also capable of inducing meningitis, like E. coli and all but one of the tested Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, were not influenced by the IFNgamma treated cells. We found that the IFNgamma or the IFNgamma/TNF alpha induced activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is responsible for the inhibition of streptococcal growth, since the addition of supplemental L-tryptophan completely blocks the IFNgamma induced bacteriostasis.
TI  - Azithromycin. A review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  - Azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. Pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. In children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. These standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. Azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. Azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. Skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. Although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.
TI  - Use of the lactococcal nisA promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  - We characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisA promoter in strains of the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. nisA promoter activity was dependent on the proteins NisR and NisK, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the extracellular inducer nisin. The nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. Significant induction of the nisA promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is inhibited. The efficiency of the nisA promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the Spac, xylA, and lacA promoters in B. subtilis and in S. pyogenes. Because nisA promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - Favorable prognosis of purulent meningitis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - We prospectively reviewed all cases of purulent meningitis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected patients > 14 years old that occurred at the Hospital General Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona) during the period 1 January 1985 through 31 March 1997. There were 12 episodes of purulent meningitis in nine of 2,150 HIV-1-infected patients. The annual rate of purulent meningitis was 0.465 cases per 1,000 patients, a rate that is 150 times higher than that for the general population. During 10 episodes, CD4+ lymphocyte counts were < 200/mm3. The etiologic organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae in nine episodes (seven episodes occurred in four splenectomized patients), and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecium each caused one episode. Clinical features and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were similar to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. All patients had bacteremia. The overall mortality was 8.3%. We conclude that purulent meningitis, particularly pneumococcal meningitis, is more frequent among HIV-1-infected patients than in the general population. The prognosis for HIV-1-infected patients is better than for HIV-1-negative patients.
TI  - A new ketolide, HMR 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  - HMR 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. The effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance was tested in a lacZ reporter system under control of several ermAM-like attenuator variants. For one constitutively resistant Streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacZ were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pJIM2246 and the plasmid was introduced into Staphylococcus aureus RN4220. For the wild-type attenuators, HMR 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart RU 6652 and erythromycin. As expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant S. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. For one S. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermAM methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced. For streptococci, the activity of HMR 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. The weak inducer activity of HMR 3004 explained its activity against inducibly MLSB-resistant S. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant E. faecalis.
TI  - The Streptococcus agalactiae hylB gene encoding hyaluronate lyase: completion of  the sequence and expression analysis.
AB  - We report the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the Streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hylB4755 allele, the first chromosomally-encoded streptococcal hyaluronate lyase gene to be cloned and sequenced completely. This gene lies in a region homologous to that found in S. mutans, between the mutX and rmlB genes, a region involved in the synthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of this organism. Sequencing of hylB4755 revealed a 3216-bp open reading frame that encodes a 121.2-kDa polypeptide possessing a 30-amino acid signal sequence which was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. A recombinant plasmid, pHYB100, containing hylB4755 together with its promoter and terminator was constructed and used to analyze the expression of the gene in Escherichia coli. In Northern hybridization experiments, hylB4755 was found to be transcribed as 3.3-kb monocistronic mRNA from its own promoter which exhibits an extended, sigma70-like 10 consensus sequence. Transcript mapping by primer extension analysis placed the major transcription initiation site leading to the longest transcript 38 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon, ATG. E. coli TG1(pHYB100) efficiently synthesized hyaluronan-cleaving enzyme activity at approximately 7000 working units/109 cells, with lyase activity detectable in all principle cellular locations. Zymography and Western analysis identified functional activity in TG1(pHYB100) to be associated with approximately 118, 110 and 94-kDa polypeptides, with the two low molecular weight species constituting the major components of the enzyme purified from the culture supernatant fluid of S. agalactiae 4755. The 118-kDa form was shown to represent the undegraded mature enzyme, whereas the smaller species are likely to arise from proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal part of the mature protein. The HylB4755 protein showed extensive sequence identity to the homologous enzymes from S. agalactiae 3502 and S. pneumoniae characterized by others but sequence comparisons clearly show that incomplete genes truncated at their 5' ends had been isolated from these two organisms.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - Identification of a novel insertion element, IS1548, in group B streptococci, predominantly in strains causing endocarditis.
AB  - Hyaluronidase has been postulated to be a virulence factor in group B streptococci (GBS). No hyaluronidase activity was found in 15 of 50 GBS isolates from adults studied. Most of these hyaluronidase-negative strains belonged to serotype III. In strains lacking hyaluronidase activity, an insertion of 1317 nucleotides was found in the hyaluronidase gene. The fragment was cloned and sequenced and found to have characteristics of a novel insertion sequence, designated IS1548. As well as in GBS serotype III, this sequence was found in 3 of 6 serotype II isolates and in all 10 group A streptococcal strains (GAS) tested. Homologies were found with repeated sequences in Streptococcus pneumoniae and with H repeats in Escherichia coli. All GBS strains harboring IS1548 and some GAS strains had one copy of IS1548 located downstream of the C5a peptidase gene. IS1548 was present in 9 of 13 GBS isolates from blood in endocarditis patients and in 3 of 22 vaginally colonizing strains.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of GV129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  - GV129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. It combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. Comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for GV129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes, including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). Against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, GV129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. GV129606 showed an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, GV129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed MIC90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with MIC90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. Against these species, GV129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with MIC90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii). Haemophilus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of GV129606. GV129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. It was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). The in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ED50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. GV129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ED50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mreA, from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. In PCR assays, total genomic DNA from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from this strain was cloned into lambda Zap II to construct a library of S. agalactiae genomic DNA. A clone, pAES63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in Escherichia coli was recovered. Deletion derivatives of pAES63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. Studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into E. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. This putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described Mef pump in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent MsrA pump in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Its gene has been designated mreA (for macrolide resistance efflux).
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - A prospective study of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in southern Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the Negev area of southern Israel. DESIGN: A prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the Soroka University Medical Center. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. Thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. During this period 70,709 births (59% Jews and 41% Bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. One hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in Bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in Jewish neonates (P < 0.001). Twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from Days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between Days 8 and 28. A total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. Fifty-seven of all isolates were Gram-negative organisms (mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and Escherichia coli (16%)). Gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. Although E. coli was the most frequently recovered Gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms in nosocomial late onset sepsis. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in late onset sepsis were nosocomial. The incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae was 3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. All cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in Bedouins. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern Israel are similar to those reported in Western Europe and the United States. The incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for Bedouins than for Jewish neonates. The distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern Israel and although Gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, S. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. In southern Israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.
TI  - Detection of meningitis antigens in buffer and body fluids by ultrasound-enhanced particle agglutination.
AB  - The standard test card agglutination of antibody-coated latex by Neisseria meningitidis. Streptococcus group B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens has been compared with a technique involving local concentration of the coated latex in an ultrasonic standing wave. The detection of positive control antigen was enhanced, compared with the test-card procedure, over a 16 to 64 fold range on exposure to ultrasound. Sample filtration eliminated non-specific agglutination on ultrasonic exposure of latex in control serum, urine or concentrated urine. Tests of meningitis patient body fluids showed increased detection of antigen with ultrasound for CSF (11/14 > 7/14) serum (8/13 > 3/13) and concentrated urine (8/17 > 2/17) compared to test card assays. The ultrasound detection of antigen in serum or concentrated urine was comparable to that achieved with CSF on test cards. Serum dilution experiments showed that ultrasound could detect antigen in serum over a 1000 fold concentration range.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - The purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (RXM). We measured the MICs of macrolide antibiotics, such as RXM, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), rokitamycin (RKM) and midecamycin (MDM), and other classes of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between October and December in 1994 and 1995. RXM had excellent antibacterial activities for S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and methicillin sensitive S. aureus. Against methicillin sensitive S. epidermidis, RXM activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had MIC > or = 128 micrograms/ml. The activity against S. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of EM, CAM, MDM, and clindamycin. The vast majority of methicillin resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. In conclusion, RXM is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus except MRSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis and M. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Infectious bursitis: study of 40 cases in the pre-patellar and olecranon regions].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Septic bursitis usually affects subcutaneous localized bursae such the prepatellar and elbow bursae. This condition is infrequently reported in the spanish medical literature. The aim of this report was to study patients suffering from septic bursitis with regard to predisposing conditions, the causative agents, therapy and clinical outcome. METHOD: A retrospective study was undertaken in patients with infectious bursitis attended in the Service of Rheumatology of the POVISA Medical Centre (Vigo) and Juan Canalejo Hospital (La Coruna), Spain, from january 1989 to january 1995. The diagnosis of septic bursitis was confirmed with positive bursal fluid cultures in all cases. RESULTS: We recovered forty cases of infectious bursitis (23 olecranon bursitis and 17 prepatellar bursitis). Most patients were male (80%), and patient mean age was 52 years (range: 14-94). The most common predisposing factors to bacterial infection were steroid therapy (15%) and alcoholism (8%), in addition to cutaneous lesions associated with occupational or recreational trauma (55%). Prepatellar septic bursitis was associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation with fever (71% vs 48%), leukocytosis (76% vs 52%), cellulitis (59% vs 48%) and positive blood cultures (25% vs 0%). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 87.5% of bursal fluid aspirations, the other etiologic microrganism were Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), Streptococcus agalactiae (2 cases) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 case). The majority of patients (80%) required initial intravenous therapy of which average duration was 11 days (range: 5-21 days). Successful resolution of septic bursitis without open surgical drainage was seen in 38 patients (95%) and there ware no functional impairment, serious complications or recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with septic bursitis suffered systemic and/or local predisposing illness. S. aureus is the commonest pathogen. Prepatellar septic bursitis is associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation and bacteremia. Usually, the prompt and proper antibiotic therapy make innecessary surgical drainage.
TI  - Lancefield grouping and smell of caramel for presumptive identification and assessment of pathogenicity in the Streptococcus milleri group.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate Lancefield grouping and caramel smell for presumptive identification of the Streptococcus milleri group, and to find whether Lancefield group, species, or protein profile correlated with virulence or infection site. METHODS: Prospective studies were made of 100 consecutive streptococcal isolates in blood cultures or pus from 100 patients in whom the severity of infection was categorised as serious, moderate, or not significant. The usefulness of Lancefield group and the caramel smell for presumptive identification was examined, and the relation of the S milleri species, Lancefield group, and SDS-PAGE protein analysis to severity of infection and infection site was investigated. Lower respiratory tract and genital tract specimens, strict anaerobes, group D streptococci, and strains identified as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae were excluded. RESULTS: Most streptococci occurring in pure or significant growth density were S milleri group (87/100; 87%, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.93). Of these, 89.7% (78/87; 0.84-0.96) were associated with infection. Lancefield group F antigen predominated (41/87; 47.1%, 0.38-0.56). Lancefield group F alone or accompanied by the caramel smell had a specificity of 100%, but a sensitivity of only 47.3% for group F alone, and 19.5% for group F accompanied by the caramel smell. There was no significant association between species, Lancefield group, and severity of infection, site of infection, or pathogenicity. SDS-PAGE analysis failed to discriminate between strains. CONCLUSIONS: Neither species nor Lancefield antigen was related to the site of infection. The presence of Lancefield group F antigen alone or accompanied by a caramel smell was a useful indicator for the S milleri group when present, but was too insensitive to use as a screening test. Most streptococci occurring in pure culture or in significant growth density were of clinical importance. Such organisms should be identified to species level to detect the S milleri group.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from Propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. The gene was isolated on an EcoRI-generated 3-kb piece of DNA. Expression was less in Escherichia coli than in P. acnes; in E. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. The gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kDa. Amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. The leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. The amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.
TI  - NMR and molecular dynamics studies of the conformational epitope of the type III  group B Streptococcus capsular polysaccharide and derivatives.
AB  - The conformational epitope of the type III group B Streptococcus capsular polysaccharide (GBSP III) exhibits unique properties which can be ascribed to the presence of sialic acid in its structure and the requirement for an extended binding site. By means of NMR and molecular dynamics studies on GBSP III and its fragments, the extended epitope of GBSP III was further defined. The influence of sialic acid on the conformational properties of GBSP III was examined by performing conformational analysis on desialylated GBSP III, which is identical to the polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14, and also on oxidized and reduced GBSP III. Conformational changes were gauged by 1H and 13C chemical shift analysis, NOE, 1D selective TOCSY-NOESY experiments, J(HH) and J(CH) variations, and NOE of OH resonances. Changes in mobility were examined by 13C T1 and T2 measurements. Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water using the AMBER force field and the GLYCAM parameter set were used to assess static and dynamic conformational models, simulate the observable NMR parameters and calculate helical parameters. GBSP III was found to be capable of forming extended helices. Hence, the length dependence of the conformational epitope could be explained by its location on extended helices within the random coil structure of GBSP III. The interaction of sialic acid with the backbone of the PS was also found to be important in defining the conformational epitope of GBSP III.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all

TI  - A method for determination of the absolute configuration of chiral glycerol residues in natural products using TEMPO oxidation and characterization of the glyceric acids formed.
AB  - A method has been developed for determination of the absolute configuration of glycerol residues in natural products. It is required that the glycerol moiety contain a primary nonsubstituted hydroxymethyl group or that such a group can be obtained by modification without racemization. The method employs TEMPO oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group, hydrolysis, butanolysis with chiral 2-butanol, and acetylation. The acetylated (+)-2-butyl esters of the glyceric acid formed by oxidation are analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The esterification can also be performed with other chiral alcohols, e.g., (-)-2-octanol. The method is general and applicable to both primary and secondary substituted glycerols. It has recently been used for determination of the chiral glycerol-1-phosphate residue of the Escherichia coli O28 O-antigen, and now we report the absolute configurations of the glycerol moieties in Streptococcus pneumoniae type 18A and Streptococcus agalactaie type III. All studied glycerol residues were found to have the D-configuration.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Antagonism of teicoplanin and vancomycin activity by chocolatized Mueller-Hinton  agar.
AB  - Chocolatized (80 degrees C, 13 min) Mueller-Hinton agar antagonized the inhibitory activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This antagonism was due to heat-exposed sheep erythrocytes, sheep hemoglobin, and the supernatant fluid from lysed sheep erythrocytes, but not to sheep serum. Neither water-soluble cholesterol, bovine albumin, bovine serum, hematin, hemin nor egg yolk suspension antagonized teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - Neurotoxicity of glia activated by gram-positive bacterial products depends on nitric oxide production.
AB  - The present study examined the mechanism by which bacterial cell walls from two gram-positive meningeal pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and the group B streptococcus, induced neuronal injury in primary cultures of rat brain cells. Cell walls from both organisms produced cellular injury to similar degrees in pure astrocyte cultures but not in pure neuronal cultures. Cell walls also induced nitric oxide production in cultures of astrocytes or microglia. When neurons were cultured together with astrocytes or microglia, the cell walls of both organisms became toxic to neurons. L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, protected neurons from cell wall-induced toxicity in mixed cultures with glia, as did dexamethasone. In contrast, an excitatory amino acid antagonist (MK801) had no effect. Low concentrations of cell walls from either gram-positive pathogen added together with the excitatory amino acid glutamate resulted in synergistic neurotoxicity that was inhibited by L-NAME. The induction of nitric oxide production and neurotoxicity by cell walls was independent of the presence of serum, whereas endotoxin exhibited these effects only in the presence of serum. We conclude that gram-positive cell walls can cause toxicity in neurons by inducing the production of nitric oxide in astrocytes and microglia.
TI  - The capsule polysaccharide synthesis locus of streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14: Identification of the glycosyl transferase gene cps14E.
AB  - To identify a chromosomal region of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 involved in capsule polysaccharide synthesis, two strategies were used: (i) Tn916 mutagenesis, followed by the characterization of four unencapsulated mutants, and (ii) cross-hybridization with a capsule polysaccharide synthesis gene (cps) probe from S. agalactiae, which has a structurally similar capsule. The two approaches detected the same chromosomal region consisting of two adjacent EcoRI fragments. One of these EcoRI fragments was cloned and hybridized with a cosmid library. This resulted in clone cMKO2. A similar cosmid clone was obtained from an unencapsulated Tn916 mutant, Spnl4.H. Sequence analysis of the two cosmid clones revealed that in the Tn916 mutant, a gene, cps14E, which is homologous to other bacterial genes encoding glycosyl transferases, had been inactivated. An open reading frame immediately downstream of cps14E, designated cps14F, shows no significant homology with any known genes or proteins. A functional assay showed that cps14E encodes a glycosyl transferase and that a gene-specific knockout mutant lacks this enzyme activity, whereas inactivation of cps14F does not have this effect.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of meropenem against clinically isolated strains. The result against strains isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of meropenem (MEPM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MEPM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid that were obtained from January, 1993 to December, 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The MIC-range, 50% MIC (MIC50) and 90% MIC (MIC90) of MEPM were equal to those of imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) against Streptococcus pneumoniae including benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes which are Gram-positive strains, and were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and cefotaxime (CTX). 2. The MIC-range, MIC50 and MIC90 of these 3 drugs of carbapenems (MEPM, IPM and PAPM) were different against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae which are Gram-negative strains. The MIC90 of MEPM was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml and those of IPM and PAPM were 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli. The MIC90 of MEPM was 0.1 microgram/ml, that of IPM was 25 micrograms/ml and that of PAPM was 6.25 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. Thus, the antimicrobial activity of MEPM was stronger than those of IPM and PAPM. The MIC90's of IPM and PAPM against H. influenzae were high with the MIC of IPM at 12.5 approximately 25 micrograms/ml and the MIC of PAPM at 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml against 3 IPM-resistant strains among 17 isolates. 3. The MIC90 of ABPC was 0.39 microgram/ml and that of CTX was 0.1 microgram/ml against 20 strains of S. pneumoniae including 6 strains of PCG-insensitive or resistant S. pneumoniae. The MIC90 of ABPC and CTX were higher than those of 3 carbapenem drugs. There were E. coli of 8 strains with ABPC-high resistance (the MIC of ABPC was > 100 micrograms/ml) and 2 strains for which MIC of CTX were 0.39 microgram/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was found that 29.4% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producing strains. 4. It appeared that antimicrobial activities of carbapenems, particularly MEPM were strong against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. MEPM will be first choice drug by empiric therapy in infections including sepsis and purulent meningitis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the eps (Exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - We report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis. This report is the first genetic work concerning EPS production in a food microorganism. The EPS secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D- D-Galp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Galp-D-GalpNAc-(1-->. The genetic locus The genetic locus was identified by Tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify Eps mutants. Sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of Sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. EPS expression in the non-EPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsA to epsM was capable of directing EPS synthesis and secretion in this host. Homology searches of the predicted proteins in the Swiss-Prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsA, B, C, D, and E and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsB, D, F, and H and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus for epsC, D, and E and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide I (EPSI) synthesis in Rhizobium meliloti for epsC to epsJ and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps K and lipB of Neisseria meningitidis. Genes (epsJ, epsL, and epsM) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the Swiss-Prot database were shown to be involved in EPS synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - An approach to the identification of the pathogens of bacterial meningitis by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A combination of universal and species-specific primers was used to detect and differentiate by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the four species most commonly causing bacterial meningitis. Primers recognising conserved sequences in the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA genes were employed to amplify the 16S-23S spacer region from Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae (type b), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus). The sequence of the most abundant spacer product was determined in each case and used to deduce species-specific primers. A nested PCR using universal primers in the first round and a species-specific primer in the second were able to detect and distinguish between the four common pathogens, in the presence of human DNA. Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of a meningitis patient with negative culture and Gram-stain results.
TI  - [Various new pathogens in pneumonia].
AB  - The table summarizes the many newly recognized agents causing lower respiratory tract infections: gram + cocci, Streptococcus agalactiae, enterococci; gram-rods, acinetobacter, Aeromonas hydrophila, Eikenella corrodens; Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to multiple drugs, intracellular organisms and viruses. Some details are given in four chapters: Pneumococci resistant to penicillin G which must be detected and impose new therapeutic strategies; Chlamydia pneumoniae with its difficulties for the diagnosis and the absence of standardized therapeutic trials; Streptococcus pyogenes with a recrudescence of severe and invasive infections, TSS and virulence factors; the pulmonary Hantavirus syndrome with 105 patients recognized (mortality 52%) in the USA and Canada, the homeland of the deermouse (Peromiscus maniculatus).
TI  - [Decreased plasma fibronectin (pFN) level in preterm infants with infections].
AB  - Plasma fibronectic (pFN) is a high molecular weight multifunction glycoprotein, which augments neutrophil and macrofage phagocytosis and acts as a nonspecific opsonin for the reticuloendothelial system. In this study we have determined pFN concentrations in fifty eight preterm infants to discriminate infected from non infected ones. Concentrations of pFN decreased from baselin in babies with early or late onset infections. The changes in pFN concentrations were not found before sepsis, but on day 1. By day 5 pFN concentrations have increased and have been no longer different from controls. We have calculated sensitivity (73.68%), specificity (74.36%), positive (58.35%) and negative (85.29%) predictive values of pFN and of other markers of infections (C-reactive protein--CRP-, Immature/Mature neutrophil ratio--I/M n. ratio-). Adding these tests to pFN, provided equal specificity and positive predictive value, but increased sensitivity (94.73%) and negative predictive value (96.43%). Thus, low concentrations of pFN may be a valuable but not early marker for neonatal infections. The combination of pFN, CRP and I/M n. ratio increase the precision of diagnostic testing.

TI  - Effect of urine latex agglutination tests on the treatment of children at risk for invasive bacterial infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying febrile children with invasive bacterial infection is difficult in the absence of telltale physical findings. Urine latex agglutination (ULA) tests have been used for rapid, on-site identification of such children. OBJECTIVES: To study the performance of ULA tests in identifying children with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and group B streptococcus infection and to examine how the results of ULA tests affect patient treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Urban children's hospital. PATIENTS: All emergency department and hospital patients tested by ULA in 1990, excluding patients in the neonatal units. RESULTS: Of 1629 patients, 36 had positive tests (20 H influenzae, 5 S pneumoniae, and 11 group B streptococcus). Thirteen of these were false positive based on culture results. Although ULA tests demonstrated excellent specificity, their sensitivity was poor. Positive predictive values for bacteremia ranged from 0.346 to 0.600, and negative predictive values ranged from 0.972 to 0.997. The decision to treat with antibiotics was made before ULA test results were available in 19 (53%) of the 36 patients with positive test results. Of 1593 patients with negative test results, 1211 (76%) were admitted to the hospital, and approximately 81% were empirically treated with parenteral antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, treatment and disposition decisions are frequently made without regard to ULA test results.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - [Therapy of neonatal infection caused by group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus].
AB  - Expectant therapy for early Group B Streptococcus onset septicemia must provide coverage against other microorganism, such as L. Monocytogenes, H. Influenzae and S. Pneumoniae. It is possible to administer a combination of antimicrobial agents with activity against all or the most likely pathogens. Thus initial expectant therapy includes a broad spectrum semisynthetic penicillin (e.g. ampicillin) and an aminoglycoside (e.g. netilmicin). Vancomicin, teicoplanin and cefotaxime may also be used. Supportive therapy consists on temperature control, i.v. administration of fluids, acid-base balance and electrolytes monitoring, seizures control and ventilation. IV immunoglobulins, granulocyte and serum transfusion are also used. The G-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF, filgastrim) usage is also reported.
TI  - A 4-year study of neonatal meningitis: clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  - The clinical and microbiological data of 60 neonates, 23 from the Neonatal Unit (Group I) and 37 (Group II) from the General Paediatric Wards with meningitis are presented. The overall prevalence/1000 was significantly lower in Group I (0.36) than in Group II (1.11; P < 0.0001). This low incidence follows the introduction of amikacin for the treatment of the ill neonate in 1986. Streptococcus agalactiae 21 (35 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 17 (28 per cent) and E. coli 10 (17 per cent) were the commonest pathogens accounting for 80 per cent of the cases. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates were uniformly susceptible to penicillin and chloramphenicol. Gram negative isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. In addition K. pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to gentamycin and amikacin. All isolates were fully susceptible to cefotaxime. Recently, four of six cases of K. pneumoniae in the Neonatal Unit were resistant to amikacin. Low birth weight, additional clinical problems, and ultrasound changes on cranial scanning carried a poor prognosis. Emphasis should be placed on close collaboration between clinicians and microbiologists in the choice of antimicrobial agents and aseptic techniques for the care of neonates.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by a seminested PCR strategy.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based diagnostic assay has been developed for the simultaneous detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and bacteria in general. In the present communication we describe the design of primers for S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and L. monocytogenes, and a general PCR protocol for the assay. The diagnostic outcome is presented for a small collection of CSF specimens including 2 samples from patients with culture-negative purulent meningitis.
TI  - Latex particle agglutination tests on the cerebrospinal fluid. A reappraisal.
AB  - Rapid diagnostic tests are often used to identify microbial etiology of infection early. Latex particle agglutination (LPA) tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are frequently used for purpose of rapid diagnosis. We evaluated their usefulness in management of patients with suspected meningitis. We also evaluated the cost effectiveness of LPAs during an 11-month period; 1,540 CSF specimens were tested for H. influenzae type b, Group B streptococcal (GBS), N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae using LPAs. Only 27 were positive. LPAs were useful in management of only the neonates with GBS infection. On the whole, LPAs were very expensive and not cost-effective.
TI  - [Yearly changes of isolated organisms from the respiratory tract in Hokusho Central Hospital].
AB  - Isolated organisms from the respiratory tract have been studied in our hospital from 1986 to 1993. The total number of samples were 18,345 and samples which showed 10(5) cfu/ml organisms were 8648 in our hospital for 8 years. Enterobacteriacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative rods were major isolates in 8 years. Haemophilus influenzae, which used to be the commonest isolate, decreased from 10.9% in 1993 while Enterobacteriacae increased from 8.9% in 1986 to 17.6% in 1993. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were major isolates from out-patients consisting of 50%, followed by Enterobacteriacae, P. aeruginosa and MSSA. Enterobacteriacae and P. aeruginosa were major isolates from in-patients, followed by MRSA and beta-Streptococcus. Streptococcus agalactiae, Serratia marcescens and Corynebacterium spp. prevailed especially in the geriatric ward. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were major isolates from patients with pneumoconiosis, especially in winter.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the gene for group B streptococcal hyaluronate lyase.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are a major cause of serious human perinatal infections. Most clinical isolates of GBS secrete hyaluronate lyase, and production of high levels of the enzyme has been associated with strain virulence. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed on the basis of the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides prepared from the purified enzyme, permitted the polymerase chain reaction amplification from GBS chromosomal DNA of a 363-base pair internal DNA fragment of the GBS hyaluronate lyase gene (hylB). This DNA fragment was used as a probe to screen a lambda phage library of GBS chromosomal DNA fragments. Sequence analysis of positive clones identified an open reading frame capable of coding for a 111-kDa protein. Since no single clone was found to contain the entire gene it was necessary to reconstruct the gene from two plasmids containing inserts with suitable overlapping sequences. When this reconstructed gene was transformed into Escherichia coli, high level expression of hyaluronate lyase activity was obtained.
TI  - Comparison of Ballard catheter bronchoalveolar lavage with bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in mechanically ventilated patients requires a large endotracheal tube, physician expertise, expensive equipment, and support staff. METHODS: The Ballard BAL catheter is a disposable coude tip 16F device that can be attached to the endotracheal tube and ventilator circuit without loss of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and also allows supplemental delivery of oxygen between the 12F inner and outer catheters. The catheter is directed into the selected bronchus. The inner catheter with mushroom tip is then advanced until it wedges by feel. Thirteen patients at a tertiary care, university hospital, had BAL performed through both the bronchoscope and Ballard BAL catheter using five aliquots of 20 mL of normal saline solution each. The return was quantified and submitted for blinded, paired laboratory investigations, including Gram stain and quantitative culture, and special stains and cultures as clinically appropriate. RESULTS: The procedure was well tolerated in all patients with no difference between devices in oxygen saturations; however, air leaks occurred in patients undergoing bronchoscopy and compromised safety in one. Two patients required reintubation to facilitate passage of the bronchoscope. The bronchoscopic BAL return averaged 49 mL (range, 5 to 85 mL) while BAL catheter averaged 37 mL (range, 18 to 70 mL) both being sufficient for all desired investigations except one patient who had undergone bronchoscopy. All were of excellent quality based on microscopy. The BAL results were concordant in nine patients: two Pneumocystis carinii, one Candida, one Streptococcus agalactiae, one Streptococcus pneumoniae, and no infection in four. Diagnoses of tuberculosis and Enterococcus (confirmed by blood culture) were obtained by the Ballard BAL catheter only. Kaposi's sarcoma and metastatic histiosarcoma were visualized by bronchoscope only. Two patients had compassionate plea use of the Ballard BAL catheter because of a small endotracheal tube. Hemorrhage secondary to lupus was documented in one and nosocomial infection was excluded in the other. CONCLUSIONS: The Ballard BAL catheter allows easy, safe BAL, without loss of diagnostic yield, when visualization is not required in mechanically ventilated patients. The Ballard BAL catheter allows maintenance of PEEP when used with the supplied adapter and can be used with small endotracheal tubes.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of genes essential for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae type 19F.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) locus of the type 19F Streptococcus pneumoniae strain SSZ was closely linked to a copy of the insertion sequence IS1202 (J.K. Morona, A. Guidolin, R. Morona, D. Hansman, and J.C. Paton, J. Bacteriol. 176:4437-4443, 1994). In the present study, we used plasmid insertion and rescue and inverse PCR to clone 6,322 bp of flanking DNA upstream of IS1202. Sequence analysis indicated that this region contains six complete open reading frames (ORFs) and one partial ORF that are arranged as a single transcriptional unit. Chromosomal disruption of any of these ORFs in a smooth-type 19F strain leads to a rough (unencapsulated) phenotype, indicating that this operon is essential for capsule production. The ORFs have therefore been designated cps19fA to cps19fG, where cps19fA is the first gene of the type 19F cps locus. Furthermore, many of the gene products from this incomplete operon exhibit strong similarities to proteins known to be involved in the production of capsular polysaccharide, exopolysaccharide, teichoic acid, enterobacterial common antigen, and lipopolysaccharide from numerous other bacterial species. This has allowed us to propose functions for many of the type 19F cps gene products. Southern hybridization studies reveal that cps19fA and cps19fB are conserved among all 12 pneumococcal serotypes tested, whereas genes downstream of cps19fB are conserved among some, but not all, of the serotypes tested.
TI  - Opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - Several standard intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) products are available in the United States and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. We evaluated more than 100 lots of IVIG, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. Neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in these preparations for Staphylococcus epidermidis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia, Ib, Ia/c, II and III; and Escherichia coli (K1). Pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. Within an IVIG lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains or serotypes of the same organism. Opsonic activity was significantly (P < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing method. We conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an IVIG lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. Clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of IVIG products by lot are known. In the future neonatal IVIG research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in cerebrospinal fluid by an assay for simultaneous detection of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci using a seminested PCR strategy.
AB  - Primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16S rRNA sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16S rRNA genes of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The PCR assay was divided into two DNA amplifications. The first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. The high specificity of the PCR assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). A total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. The assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. With agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the PCR products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) CFU/ml.
TI  - [Epidemiology of primary bacterial meningitis].
AB  - In industrialized countries, the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis is between 5 and 10 cases/10(5) population/year. The highest age-specific attack rates are recorded between 0 and 2 years of age and can reach 100 cases/10(5) population/year or more in some countries. In this range of age, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli are responsible for meningitis in neonates whereas Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae cause meningitis in children older than 1 month. H. influenzae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children but its incidence has declined since the introduction of routine childhood immunization with conjugate vaccines. N. meningitidis is the leading cause of meningitis in teenagers and young adults, whereas S. pneumoniae is responsible for most of meningitis in the elderly. Prognosis of bacterial meningitis mainly depends on the type of causative organism and on the age of onset. Detailed epidemiologic features of Haemophilus, meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis are provided.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Clinical usefulness of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen studies.
AB  - A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate the effect that positive results of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen tests had on the care of patients with presumed bacterial meningitis. Of 901 tests ordered, costing $26,000 per year, 29 showed positive results--and only four of these affected patient care. By using cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen testing only when another test does not identify an organism, or in an attempt to determine central nervous system infection late in therapy for presumed sepsis, one can greatly reduce costs with no detrimental effect on patients.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The effects of nonclassic pediatric bacterial pathogens on the usefulness of the  Directigen latex agglutination test.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are classically the predominant meningeal pathogens of children. The Directigen latex agglutination test identifies these pathogens by detecting specific antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine. The authors tested 1151 specimens from 791 children with suspected meningeal infections. They found that the sensitivity of the Directigen test for detecting the five classic CSF pathogens of children was 83.3% with CSF and 60% with urine specimens. In detecting all pathogens, however, the sensitivity was only 50% with CSF and 37.5% with urine. Thus, an increased prevalence of nonclassic pathogens in a pediatric population adversely affects the efficacy of the Directigen test for confirming a diagnosis of meningitis and emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the clinical history and other routine CSF tests.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. The mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. The mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. These drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; for Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae. The average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. The lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment and prevention of meningitis.
AB  - The efficacy of the conjugate polysaccharide H influenzae type b vaccine has resulted in a reduction in the number of cases of meningitis. Physicians will manage fewer cases of meningitis but they must maintain skills in diagnosis and treatment of the cases that do occur. In addition, to a continuing experience with meningitis due to S pneumoniae and N meningitidis, physicians must be aggressive in obtaining materials for specific diagnosis of aseptic meningitis since many of the infections are treatable with antimicrobial agents. Appropriate treatment of meningitis in children requires knowledge of agents for initial therapy, dosage schedules, changes in the regimen that may be required once the organism is isolated and results of susceptibility tests are available, knowledge of the drugs that require monitoring of serum concentrations to determine safety and efficacy, and antimicrobial prophylaxis for contacts.
TI  - PCR primers and probes for the 16S rRNA gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A set of broad-range PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the PCR product. The first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a Bacteroides-Flavobacterium probe, and two probes for other gram-negative species. The second series was designed to detect PCR products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The third series was designed for the detection of DNA from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The primers amplified DNA from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. Southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being Deinococcus radiopugnans and Gardnerella vaginalis. The gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria, Alloiococcus otitis and Rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by Gram stain characteristics. The CSF pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. Testing of the CSF pathogen and contaminant probes against DNA from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in CSF.
TI  - [The contribution of latex tests for the diagnosis of bacterial infections in Abidjan].
AB  - From 313 samples of CSF, urine, sera and pleural liquid, the authors show how appreciable is the contribution in research of soluble antigens by sensibilized latex particles agglutination method in etiologic diagnosis, especially during meningitis, pulmonary and neonatal infections. Soluble antigens were declared positives in 62.26% of cases against S. pneumoniae, 25.4% of cases against H. influenzae, 6.66% of cases against S. agalactiae, 5.71% of cases against N. meningitidis C, with variable percentages from one biological liquid to another. Compared to classical bacteriologic techniques, this method allows the diagnosis of an infection even when decapitated, and could be used in emergency diagnosis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Separation and isolation of viable bacteria by capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Mixtures of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Streptococcus pyogenes  (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6303), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), were resolved into discrete electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. Analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. E. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. These findings suggest that CZE can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.
TI  - Adverse perinatal outcome and resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes and group B streptococcus carriage.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with  resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and group B streptococcus. METHODS: Maternal and neonatal records were reviewed of four cases in which adverse perinatal outcomes occurred from resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for either PROM or positive group B streptococcal cultures. Information on clinical setting, antibiotic usage, maternal and neonatal complications, and maternal and neonatal cultures was noted. RESULTS: All four cases were complicated by PROM at 25-35 weeks' gestation. Ampicillin or amoxicillin was used in several clinical settings, including therapeutically for the presence of group B streptococcus, presumptively for PROM, and prophylactically pending the results of group B streptococcal cultures. Clinical chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in all four cases, and in two cases the maternal course was prolonged and complicated by persistent fever and the need for therapy for pelvic vein thrombophlebitis. Two neonates died from fulminant clinical sepsis. A third infant, one of a twin gestation, was stillborn, presumably because of sepsis. In three cases, neonatal and placental cultures revealed Escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin; in the fourth case, Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, with only intermediate sensitivity to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: Resistant Enterobacteriaceae associated with adverse perinatal outcomes may result from the use of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, after PROM. In deciding whether antibiotic therapy for PROM or group B streptococcal prophylaxis is appropriate, the value of purported benefits must be weighed against presumably infrequent but serious outcomes, including neonatal sepsis and death due to selection or overgrowth of resistant organisms.
TI  - Streptococcal update. A microbiology perspective.
AB  - The streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. Rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the Aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by Group A Streptococcus. Group B, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. A major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. Australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of S pneumoniae. The oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. Disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, Group A has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis and meningitis in Mallorca, Spain, 1977-1991.
AB  - In a retrospective study at Son Dureta Hospital (Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca, Spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. Overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. The case-fatality rate was 7.5%. Infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group B Streptococcus and Listeria species. The patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. From 1977 to 1984, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. Group B Streptococcus organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. The frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. Invasive infection caused by Candida organisms was found in two patients. The incidence of infection due to group B streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the termini and chromosomal locus involved in site-specific integration of the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252.
AB  - The 47-kb, broad-host-range, streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252 is capable of site-specific integration into the pneumococcal chromosome. We present the nucleotide sequence of the terminal regions of the transposon and its target site in the pneumococcal genome. No inverted repeats were found at the termini of the transposon. A 72-bp region of the target was present on either side following the insertion of Tn5252 and appeared to serve as a signal for its integration and excision. The data suggest that the left copy of the 72-bp segment was a part of the conjugative element, the crossover point of integration was nonrandom within this region, and the mechanism of insertion could resemble that of the site-specific temperate phages.
TI  - Correlating infectious outcome with clinical parameters of 1130 consecutive febrile infants aged zero to eight weeks.
AB  - The study objectives were to characterize the infectious outcomes and associated  clinical parameters of a large group of febrile young infants who received outpatient sepsis evaluation. This retrospective review of consecutive cases during a seven-year period was set in an urban pediatric emergency department. Febrile infants, aged zero to eight weeks, were the participants. All received a standard evaluation for sepsis, including complete blood count/blood culture, lumbar puncture/cerebrospinal fluid culture, and urinalysis/urine culture. Of 1130 patients, 447 (42%) were aged zero to four weeks, and 683 (58%) were aged four to eight weeks. In 96 cases (8.5%), a bacterial pathogen was isolated by culture of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or stool; 58% were aged zero to four weeks and 42% were aged four to eight weeks. The rate of positive cultures per patient age was doubled in those aged zero to four weeks (12%) compared with those aged four to eight weeks (6%). The 49 cases of invasive bacterial infections (bacterial meningitis/bacteremia) were most commonly associated with lower degrees of fever, as slightly over one half (25/49) had temperature < 39 degrees C. The most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection were group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli, accounting for 33 of 49 cases (67%); the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection in older children (Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were relatively underrepresented, accounting for only five of these 49 (10%) cases.
TI  - Co-existent cross-infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B streptococci on an adult oncology unit.
AB  - An outbreak of respiratory infection in an adult oncology unit is described where there was evidence of co-existent cross-infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 and Lancefield group B streptococcus type Ia. The presumed route of transmission was droplet spread from patient to patient. No further cases arose after the ward had been closed to new admissions and all symptomatic patients were treated with erythromycin. We suggest that patients with pneumococcal pneumonia on units housing elderly debilitated patients should be isolated. Infection control teams should be aware of the ability of Lancefield group B streptococci to spread by cross-infection among adult patients.
TI  - Cefprozil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. It is particularly active against the Gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. Cefprozil is also moderately active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, many Enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. In comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. Cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. In children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. Thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. While cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Clinical and experimental study of xiao er ke cuan ling oral liquid in the treatment of infantile bronchopneumonia].
AB  - Xiao Er Ke Chuan Ling Oral Liquid (KCL) is a Chinese herbal preparation consisted of 10 herbs such as Prunus armeniacae, Scutelaria baicalensis, Lonicera japonica etc. 30 children suffering from bronchopneumonia and/or acute bronchitis were treated with KCL (treated group) and another 30 cases were treated with penicillin and aminophylline (control group). RESULTS: cure rate and effective rate in treated group was 26.6%, and 93.3% respectively. While in control group was 30% and 96.6% respectively. No significant differences were seen between them(P > 0.05). The pharmacodynamic experiment showed KCL had potent pharmacological action. The experiment on tracheal fragment of Guinea pig in vitro showed it caused moderately strong smooth muscle relaxation, through inhibition the effect of histamine and acetylcholine. Asthma induction experiment of Guinea pig in vivo showed KCL could significantly prolong the latent period of asthma and alleviate asthmatic symptom. Ammonium water cough induction experiment in mice showed it may apparently prolong cough latent period and reduce times of cough relapse and alleviate cough symptom. KCL had potent antipyretic effect on fever model induced by triple vaccine in rabbits. Bacteriostatic and antiviral experiment in vitro showed the drug had quite strong inhibitory effects for Streptococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Flexners Dysentery bacillus, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it could potently inhibit the respiratory syncytial virus. KCL is an effective drug in treating bronchopneumonia and acute bronchitis.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of RU 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester HR 916.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. The MICs of RU 29246 for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for Morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and Proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). RU 29246 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to RU 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. RU 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM-1 and SHV-1). However, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9) was detected. Results of the study suggested that RU 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
TI  - [Basic and clinical study of meropenem in pediatric field].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in a cooperative study involving 12 pediatric and 1 neonatologic facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activity Antibacterial activity of MEPM against stock organisms including 31 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 14 of Listeria monocytogenes, 4 of Bordetella pertussis and 3 of Neisseria meningitidis ranged from 0.025 to 0.10 micrograms/ml in MIC90's, which were equal or lower than those of control drugs such as imipenem cefazolin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and latamoxef. MICs against clinical isolates were as follows: In Gram-positive bacteria, MICs were 0.20 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.025 micrograms/ml or less against 4 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In Gram-negative bacilli, MICs were 0.10 micrograms/ml to 0.20 micrograms/ml against 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 0.78, 0.10 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC against 1 strain of Peptococcus saccharolyticus was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml. 2. Pharmacokinetics Maximum plasma concentrations after intravenous infusion of MEPM over 30 minutes at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively, to 3 different groups of 3 children (total 9 cases) were observed at the completion of the treatment. Mean maximum concentrations in the 3 groups were 36.3, 69.5 and 129.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, exhibiting clear dose response. Mean plasma half lives in beta phase were 0.94, 0.86 and 0.94 hours, respectively, exhibiting no difference by doses, and this trend was observed also by HPLC. Urinary excretion rates in the first 6 hours after dose in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups were 67.3, 65.6 and 68.4%, respectively. Concentrations of MEPM in cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 2 cases of pyogenic meningitis. In 1 case, 500 mg (5.9 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes and concentrations on Days 6, 8 and 15 observed at 190, 60 and 100 minutes after respective doses were 0.13, 0.10 micrograms/ml and less than the detection limit. Cerebrospinal fluid-plasma concentration ratio was determinable only on Day 8 and was 2.8%. In another case to which 250 mg (38.5 mg/kg) of MEPM was infused intravenously over 30 minutes, the concentration at Days 6, 7 and 10, 1 hour after the dose were less than the detection limit on day 6, and 2.04 and 2.62 micrograms/ml, respectively on days 7 and 10. 3. Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 49 cases and the efficacy rate was 93.9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in Streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Surface proteins of Streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. The reason for this is not clear. The present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. The results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of S. mutans NG8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a pH-dependent manner with optimal release at pH 5 to 6. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. Two proteins, adhesin P1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. The release of adhesin P1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, Cu2+,Zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. The inhibition by heat and Cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-p-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of P1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. Adhesin P1 from Cu(2+)-inactivated S. mutans NG8 protoplasts could be released by mixing with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a P1-negative mutant of NG8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. This P1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of S. mutans and one strain each of S. gordonii, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes. The biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. However, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. Two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. The two compounds displayed similar activities. The MIC90s of RP 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L in 114 strains of Staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). Similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. RP 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L for Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 20), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (MIC90, 8 mg/L). In view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, RP 59500 merits further investigation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - Influence by staphylococcal lipase on granulocyte metabolism and killing of bacteria.
AB  - Lipase purified from Staphylococcus aureus interferes with granulocyte phagocytic killing of S. aureus but not with killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus agalactiae group B. Lipase treatment of granulocytes did not influence bacterial adherence to the cells.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  - Flomoxef sodium (FMOX) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). Serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. Serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml) and N.D. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. FMOX was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected, and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. In 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. The bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of Escherichia coli, and 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". Moreover, the drug, administered with or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. No side effects were observed in any of the patients. Concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in GOT were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. The results suggest that FMOX is useful and safe also in neonates.
TI  - Direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a DNA probe.
AB  - This study involved the rapid, direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (BACTEC, Johnston Laboratories, Inc.) by using the AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) culture confirmation test. This method uses a chemiluminescent DNA probe that detects the rRNA of the target organisms. The manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. Two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. The first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml) from the blood culture bottle. The second method used a microcentrifuge and less volume (1 to 1.5 ml). A total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by AccuProbe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. The microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. When combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the AccuProbe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140, and PD 131501). A quinolone with high activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140 and PD 131501) is a new antimicrobial agent of the  piperazinyl quinolone class. Relative to other quinolones, it is a potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal drug in vitro: The microbroth 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) (in microgram/ml) was 0.25 vs 26 methicillin-resistant and -sensitive coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci and 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae; 0.5 vs 20 strains each of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecalis. The data indicate sparfloxacin to be generally superior to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, cefazolin, doxycycline, amikacin, and vancomycin against these Gram-positive bacterial groups. Additional MIC90s were determined for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (less than or equal to 0.03); Enterobacteriaceae (0.5); and Listeria monocytogenes (1). Activity was generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic-anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium cholate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine. Naturally occurring resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of 10(-8) or lower.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810, CPR), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma and urinary levels of CPR were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. Average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. Average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. The results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with CPR were investigated. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of 49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. These results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. These levels appear to be higher than MIC90 values against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. CPR was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. Evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute UTI, totalling 61 cases. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 38 cases, good in 22 cases and fair in 1 case with an efficacy rete of 98.4% (excellent + good).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - [Clinical features and evaluation of initial antibiotic treatment in 125 cases with purulent meningitis in infancy and childhood].
AB  - A survey of purulent meningitis in infancy and childhood from 1980 through 1986 was made by sending questionnaires to 32 pediatric institutions in Aichi, Gifu and Shizuoka prefectures. Case cards of 125 patients were collected and analyzed. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.78. The age distribution for all patients was as follows: younger than 1 month, 24.8%; 1-12 months, 32.8%; 1 year, 19.2%; 2-5 years, 16.0%; older than 6 years, 7.2%. Nearly 3/4 of all purulent meningitis cases occurred in infancy. 2. The isolation rate of causative organisms was 71.2%. The 4 major causative organisms were Haemophilus sp. (28 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (14 cases), Streptococcus agalactiae (13 cases), and Escherichia coli (12 cases). Haemophilus sp. was dominant in patients over 3 months of age, and S. pneumoniae was noted in all age groups. The latter 2 were dominant under 3 months of age. 3. The outcome of 125 cases was as follows: cured, 73 cases (58.4%); improved, 26 cases (20.8%); dead, 15 cases (12.0%); unknown, 11 cases (8.8%). As to the outcome by age, the mortality of infants within 1 month old was the highest, 29.0%, and then decreased with increasing age. As to the outcome by causative organisms, Haemophilus sp. and E. coli were associated with good outcome, whereas S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae with poor outcome. 4. Among several antibiotics, ampicillin was the most frequently used in 94 cases, followed by cefotaxime in 50 cases. 5. As to the initial antibiotic treatment, 51 cases were treated with penicillins (PCs) (including PCs + aminoglycosides (AGs], 9 cases with cephalosporins group I, II, IV, (CEPs I, II, IV) (including CEPs I, II, IV + AGs), 25 cases with CEPs V (including CEPs V + AGs) and 31 cases with CEPs V + PCs (including CEPs V + PCs + AGs). No significant differences were observed in the outcome among these initial treatment group. 6. Compared with the initial treatments of CEPs V or CEPs V + PCs groups, other antibiotics were used more frequently in those of PCs + AGs and CEPs I, II, IV groups. In the light of this analysis, the initial treatments of purulent meningitis with PCs + AGs or CEPs I, II, IV were not so effective as those with CEPs V or CEPs V + PCs.
TI  - [The use of the Auto-Microbic-System (AMS) for mastitis diagnosis in cattle].
AB  - In the period of January 1987 to March 1988 15,800 quarter milk samples of dairy  cows from problem herds in Lower Austria were collected and 744 streptococci strains isolated. For the classification of those 744 isolates a comparative evaluation was carried out by means of the Auto-Microbic-System (AMS), API 20 STREP and CAMP-Test. With the AMS, 360 (= 48.4%) of the 744 isolates examined could be identified as streptococci and classified as follows: 16 Sc. agalactiae; 205 Enterococci (101 Sc. faecalis, 92 Sc. faecium, 12 Sc. avium); 74 Sc. uberis; 61 Sc. of the viridans streptococci and 4 Sc. pneumoniae. The test systems showed a correlation of 91.6%. AMS and API 20 STREP could classify 4 CAMP-negative streptococci strains to Sc. agalactiae. Based on these examinations the AMS can be recommended for the identification and classification of mastitis streptococci. It can be concluded that AMS is simple to use due to the automatic cycle, and is time saving because results can be obtained between 5 to 6 hours. On the other hand, AMS requires expensive equipment.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - Immunoblotting and culture positive endocarditis.
AB  - Serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus lactis and a "nutritionally" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. In S mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of IgM against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. In S pneumoniae IgM against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. In S agalactiae IgM against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. In S lactis endocarditis specific IgM was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and 58 kilodaltons. With the "nutritionally" variant streptococcus it was impossible to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - Cefixime shows good effects on group A and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - There is continued interest in the development of oral beta-lactam compounds, which can be used clinically to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci. Cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cefixime is highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. In this study the authors examined the effects of this molecule on Group A and Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci, recently isolated from clinical specimens in the authors' laboratory. MICs and the growth curves of 36 strains of Group A streptococci and the effects of sub-MICs on buccal cell adhesion were evaluated. The results show that concerning the sub-MIC cefixime effect on streptococci adherence, the treatment led to a decrease in adherence to the cells of the strains studied. Moreover cefixime showed good activity with 86.1% of the strains with MIC less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, and the growth curves demonstrated that the molecule possesses a bactericidal effect after 3 h. Concerning Group B streptococci, 70.3% of the strains showed a MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. In conclusion cefixime demonstrates good activity on beta-haemolytic streptococci, particularly those of Group A.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in the United States, 1986: report of a multistate surveillance study. The Bacterial Meningitis Study Group.
AB  - A prospective, laboratory-based surveillance project obtained accurate data on meningitis in a population of 34 million people during 1986. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis (45%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18%), and Neisseria meningitidis (14%). Rates of H. influenzae meningitis varied significantly by region, from 1.9/100,000 in New Jersey to 4.0/100,000 in Washington state. The overall case fatality rates for meningitis were lower than those reported in several studies from the early 1970s, suggesting that improvements in early detection and antibiotic treatment may have occurred since that time. Concurrent surveillance was also performed for all invasive disease due to the five most common causes of bacterial meningitis. Serotypes of group B streptococcus other than type III caused more than half of neonatal group B streptococcal disease and mortality, suggesting that an optimal vaccine preparation must be multivalent. Of the organisms evaluated, group B streptococcus was the second most common cause of invasive disease in persons greater than 5 years old.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [The Automicrobic System (AMS)--a new test method for the classification and susceptibility testing of bovine mastitis streptococci].
AB  - In the period of January 1987 to March 1988 15,800 quarter milk samples from cows of Lower Austrian problem herds were collected and 744 streptococci strains isolated. These 744 isolates were identified by means of the AUTO-MICROBIC-SYSTEM (AMS). As comparative methods the test system API 20 STREP as well as the comparison with the agar-diffusion test. Due to AMS 360 (=48.4%) of the 744 isolates examined could be identified as streptococci and referred to following species: 16 (=4.4%) Sc. agalactiae, 205 (=56.9%) Enterococci; 74 (=20.5%) Sc. uberis; 61 (=16.9%) Sc. of the viridans streptococci and 4 (=1.1%) Sc. pneumoniae. Both test systems AMS and API 20 STREP showed a coincidence of 91.6%.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Sensorineural hearing loss in children recovered from purulent meningitis: a study in Thai children at Ramathibodi Hospital.
AB  - Hearing loss is one of the serious complications of bacterial meningitis. Conventional audiometry and auditory brainstem response (ABR) methods were used to detect this complication in eighteen children who recovered from bacterial meningitis treated at Ramathibodi Hospital from January 1983 to December 1987. Six patients (33%) were found to have persistent bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Among them, the causes of meningitis were: Hemophilus influenzae (3 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (1 patient) and Escherichia coli (1 patient). Various clinical and demographic factors were examined in relation to the hearing loss, but no significant correlation was observed. Since meningitis often affects small children and makes conventional audiometry tests difficult, ABR was found to be a more effective method for testing this group of patients.
TI  - Polyvalent group B streptococcal immune globulin for intravenous administration:  overview.
AB  - Immunoglobulin therapy is becoming an important modality for the prevention and treatment of bacterial and viral infection. Standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is made from large pools of plasma obtained from normal blood donors. However, lot-to-lot variation in titers of antibody to specific microbial pathogens may diminish therapeutic efficacy. Since group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important neonatal pathogen, a preparation with high titers of activity against GBS was prepared and studied. Plasma was obtained from volunteers immunized with a polyvalent GBS vaccine and was processed by the Swiss Red Cross for intravenous infusion. This high-titered GBS intravenous immunoglobulin (GBS-IVIG) was shown to be superior both in vitro and in vivo to standard IVIG. GBS-IVIG provided protection when therapy was delayed for up to 24 hours after infection. Standard IVIG did not protect animals against all GBS strains. However, GBS-IVIG enhanced survival from infection with all strains tested, even when the challenge dose of GBS was increased by 2 log units. Specific hyperimmune globulins to pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been studied. Immunization of adult volunteers as a means of obtaining hyperimmune globulin appears to be an effective method of producing high-titered pathogen-specific preparations of IVIG.
TI  - Bacterial counts in cerebrospinal fluid of children with meningitis.
AB  - Eighty-five cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from the same number of pediatric patients with meningitis were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship of this count to the microscopy results, the ages of the patients and the bacterial species isolated. Bacterial counts ranged from 2 x 10 to 4 x 10(9) CFU/ml CSF. Twenty-five percent of the 85 CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli K1 and group B streptococci had counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. Children between 1 and 6 months of age had significantly higher counts (p less than 0.05) than the other age groups. The three patients who had positive CSF cultures 24 h after the start of therapy all had initial bacterial counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. The detection limit for Gram stain/microscopy was 10(5) CFU/ml. No correlation was found between bacterial count and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Short course single daily ceftriaxone monotherapy for acute bacterial meningitis  in children: results of a Swiss multicenter study. Part II: Bacteriological results.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, ampicillin and chloramphenicol was studied  at a reference laboratory against the isolates of the first 33 patients enrolled in a pediatric Swiss Multicenter Meningitis Study. The predictive value of the MIC data of 31 of the strains was further corroborated by two sets of bacterial killing curves in broth supplemented with 2 g/l of albumin. Ceftriaxone had the lowest geometric mean MIC values against all groups of isolates except for ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae. The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone and that of ampicillin, alone and in combination with chloramphenicol, was compared at six times the respective MICs and at pharmacologically readily achievable concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. The bactericidal power of ceftriaxone at six times the MIC was as good or better than that of ampicillin alone or in combination against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae despite the very low drug concentrations of ceftriaxone compared to that of the competitors; and it was barely lower at six times the MIC and at 1 mg/l (a level that is readily surpassed in CSF at the 24 h trough level after a single daily dose of ceftriaxone of 100 mg/kg (neonates 50 mg/kg) than that of ampicillin and chloramphenicol at much higher concentrations against Haemophilus influenzae type b.
TI  - Microbiological flora in men with non-gonococcal urethritis with particular reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In a microbiological study of the urethral flora in men with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), Chlamydia trachomatis (isolated from 30% of men) was the only organism isolated significantly more often from men with NGU than controls (P less than 0.01). Bacteroids species, especially of the melaninogenicus-oralis group, were the predominant anaerobic bacterial isolate from both men with NGU (isolated from 24%) and controls (isolated from 30%). There was no evidence that aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria or herpes simplex virus made a significant contribution as primary pathogens in non-chlamydial NGU. Gram-positive cocci were the only anaerobic organism isolated more often from chlamydia-positive men (29%) than chlamydia-negative men (16%) with NGU (P less than 0.01). The significance of this remains unclear.
TI  - Central nervous system complications associated with acute otitis media in children.
AB  - The purpose of this article is to review a subset of pediatric patients with otitis media occurring simultaneously with meningitis and other central nervous system diseases. Of the 92 cases reviewed, 61.3% involved patients under 12 months of age. Meningitis associated with otitis media involved 91% of the patients; the remainder had nonmeningitic central involvement. The most striking finding was the high incidence of Haemophilus influenza type-B, a relatively uncommon pathogen of the middle ear. This finding highlights the need to select antibiotic coverage to adequately treat Haemophilus influenza type-B.
TI  - Presence of chromosomal elements resembling the composite structure Tn3701 in streptococci.
AB  - Tn3701, carried by Streptococcus pyogenes A454, is the first chromosomal composite element to be described; it contains in its central region Tn3703, a transposon similar to Tn916. A comparison by DNA-DNA hybridization of Tn3701 with omega(cat-tet) and Tn3951, carried by Streptococcus pneumoniae BM6001 and by Streptococcus agalactiae B109, respectively, revealed that the two latter structures are also Tn3701-like composite elements. The DNAs of 27 other antibiotic-resistant group A, B, C, and G streptococci and of S. pneumoniae BM4200 showed sequence homologies to Tn3701 (14 strains, including BM4200), to the regions of Tn3701 outside of Tn3703 (5 strains), and to Tn916 alone (8 strains). The DNAs of five strains did not detectably hybridize with any probe. The tetM gene was identified in most chromosomal genetic elements coding for tetracycline-minocycline resistance. Since Tn3701-like elements are widely disseminated among antibiotic-resistant streptococci (47% of the 34 strains studied), we propose that Tn3701 be considered the prototype of chromosomal composite elements.
TI  - New receptor for human plasminogen on gram positive cocci.
AB  - 180 bacterial strains representing 17 different species of gram positive cocci were tested for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Receptors for plasminogen could be detected on 23/24 strains of S. pyogenes, 15/15 strains of S. equisimilis, 14/16 strains of human group G streptococci and 14/14 strains of S. pneumoniae. Eight of nineteen strains representing five species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were also positive. S. equisimilis demonstrated the highest uptake with a median value of 58 per cent (20%-67%). On the other hand, all strains of S. agalactiae, the majority of S. faecalis and all S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains tested were negative. The concentration of unlabelled plasminogen causing a 50 per cent reduction of bound tracer was between 50 and 150 mM. These estimates of the dissociation constant confirmed the specific nature of the interaction. Binding of plasminogen could be blocked by addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex, suggesting that plasminogen and plasmin bind to the same receptor. Binding was also blocked by the plasminogen fragment kringle 1-3, but not by miniplasminogen, a fragment containing kringle 5 and the B-chain region. As streptokinase interacts mainly with the B-chain of plasmin it is clear that the bacterial receptor for plasminogen is not identical to streptokinase.
TI  - Definition of a bacterial virulence factor: sialylation of the group B streptococcal capsule.
AB  - Sialylation of bacterial capsules has been proposed as an important virulence factor for several species of encapsulated pathogens, including group B Streptococcus. We have constructed a transposon mutant strain of type III group B Streptococcus that expresses a capsular polysaccharide differing from the wild type only in that the mutant strain's capsule lacks sialic acid. The mutant polysaccharide is antigenically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of type 14 Streptococcus pneumoniae, as predicted by the structures of the type III group B Streptococcus and S. pneumoniae polysaccharides. Loss of capsular sialic acid was associated with loss of virulence in the mutant strain in a neonatal rat model of lethal group B Streptococcus infection. These studies demonstrate directly that capsular sialic acid is a critical virulence determinant for type III group B Streptococcus and support the general hypothesis that surface sialylation aids pathogenic microorganisms in evading host defenses.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  - To study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membrane receptor (FcRlo, CR1, and CR3)-mediated phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups A and B streptococci were examined. IGIV alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. When these bacteria were preopsonized in IGIV, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. The in vitro opsonic activity of IGIV for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by the IGIV-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, P less than .05). The in vivo protective efficacy of IGIV also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, P less than .001). Antibodies to FcRlo (Leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in IGIV but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific IgM. Both CR1 and CR3 receptors on PMNLs were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacteriological findings after premature rupture of the membranes.
AB  - Of 243 children born after premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) 61 (26%) had the same bacteria in placental arterial blood, in ear swabs (taken deep from the external auditory canal) and in meconium. The predominant organisms were E. coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus faecalis (enterococci) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci). The infection rate was only 10% if the membranes had ruptured within 24 h of the onset of labour and 30% if the interval was longer than 24 h. Of 131 children born without premature rupture of the membranes but with risk factors for sepsis 9 (7%) had a positive blood culture with the same organism in the ear swabs and in meconium. The organisms were Streptococcus agalactiae (6 cases) and E. coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one case each). Contamination of placental blood cultures was rare.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Group B streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  - Infection with group B streptococci (GBS) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. In the present studies, we have examined the effects of group B streptococci on C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Fresh human serum was activated to form C5a and C5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. The activated serum was then incubated with group B organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Group B organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in C-dependent chemotactic activity. The degree of inhibition was profound with 1 X 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). Experiments indicated that significant chemotactic factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to GBS organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. A number of different strains of GBS of types I, II, and III possessed inhibitory activity. In contrast, group D streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Group A streptococci that were M protein positive also inactivated C-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. The inhibitory activity of the GBS strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. C5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by RIA were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain suggesting that absorption was not involved. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that group B streptococci degrade the C5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 Da. Thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of GBS infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate C-derived inflammatory mediators. The GBS C5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - Production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
TI  - [Microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. It has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. We measured, using the GA-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. Also activities (expressed in MICs) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Tested organisms included Streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as Gram-positive cocci, and Haemophilus influenzae (1), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Bordetella pertussis (12), Salmonella sp. (4) and Campylobacter jejuni (103) as Gram-negative bacilli. Against stock strains of bacteria, MICs of 10 drugs (RKM, erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), midecamycin acetate (MOM), clindamycin (CLDM), amoxicillin (AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), minocycline, ofloxacin (OFLX] were determined. Against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with RKM, MICs of only 4 drugs (RKM, EM, JM, MOM) were determined. Measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of RKM and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with RKM (dry syrup). Two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with RKM at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Clinical and bacteriological effects of RKM were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28 streptococcal infections, 29 Campylobacter enteritis, 4 Salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. Five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. In the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. Adverse reactions of RKM and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. Obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. The GA-test produced pH values indicating that amounts of gastric acid were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Of the recent isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to RKM than to josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), erythromycin and lincomycin. Also, macrolides (MLs)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to RKM. 2. Recent isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, group G Streptococci, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to RKM than to midecamycin acetate and JM. Oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. T1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first 6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. Fifty-two patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Campylobacter enteritis, etc. were treated with RKM at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. An eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. A side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.
TI  - The gram-positive cocci: I. Streptococci.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef in comparison to other cephalosporins.
AB  - Flomoxef and cefazolin had nearly the same activity against staphylococci, which  was stronger than that of other cephalosporins. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, cefotaxime and cefazolin were more active than flomoxef, but the other cephamycins were less active than flomoxef. In comparison to the other cephalosporins, latamoxef and flomoxef had higher activity against Branhamella catarrhalis, whereas cefotaxime, latamoxef and cefotetan were more active against Haemophilus influenzae. Flomoxef was the only drug exhibiting activity against Clostridium difficile. The activity of flomoxef and latamoxef against Bacteroides fragilis was stronger than that of the other cephalosporins, but Bacteroides bivius was resistant to each of these antibiotics.
TI  - Two genes for chloramphenicol resistance common to staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - Southern blot hybridization and pneumococcal transformation were used to study the epidemiology at a molecular level of the genes for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) in streptococci and staphylococci. The cat gene of staphylococcal plasmid pC194 showed homology to the cat genes of the chromosomal elements of 5 different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and of Streptococcus agalactiae B109. DNA sequence homology was also detected between the cat gene of staphylococcal plasmid pC221 and the cat gene of broad host range conjugative plasmid pIP501, originally isolated from S. agalactiae. Two different cat genes appear to be present in clinical isolates of both streptococci and staphylococci.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone in the treatment of neonatal infections].
AB  - Ceftriaxone (CTRX) was administered to the newborn and its clinical effectiveness as well as its blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels were studied. 1. Average blood levels of CTRX 1 hour after single intravenous administration were 39 micrograms/ml in 2 cases receiving about 10 mg/kg, 70 micrograms/ml in 2 other cases receiving 20 mg/kg and 208 micrograms/ml in one receiving 52.6 mg/kg. As is apparent from these cases data, blood levels of CTRX were dose dependent. Blood levels of the drug were between 3.7 to 12.4 micrograms/ml 24 hours later. Half-lives of the drug in blood in the 5 newborns ranged from 7.13 to 10.6 hours. In a 53-day-old patient receiving 43.4 mg/kg of CTRX via intravenous injection, the one-hour blood level of the drug was 140 micrograms/ml and the half-life was 3.68 hours. The blood level of the drug 36 hours after single intravenous administration with 17.3 to 20.0 micrograms/ml to 5 other cases 0 to 5 days of age ranged from 4.6 to 13.7 micrograms/ml. 2. The cerebrospinal fluid level of CTRX 4 hours after intravenous administration with 49.6 mg/kg to cases of Escherichia coli meningitis was 9.7 micrograms/ml on the first day following the start of the treatment. It increased to 23.6, 25.2 and 31.0 micrograms/ml on the third, fourth and fifth days, respectively, and then gradually decreased. Cerebrospinal level was still 5.8 micrograms/ml on the 22nd day during the recovery period. These levels were far more than 1,000 times as much as the MIC for the pathogen at the highest level, and more than 100 times even at the lowest level. 3. CTRX was administered via intravenous injection once or twice a day (11.0-39.5 mg/kg in total) to 13 newborns and 3 infants. The efficacy of CTRX was good to excellent in 10 cases for treatment of 11 diseases (sepsis 1, pneumonia 4, urinary tract infection 4 and fetal infection 2) and all the pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae 1, E. coli 3, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2, Citrobacter diversus 1) disappeared. In 6 cases where CTRX was used prophylactically, infection did not occur at all. The efficacy was excellent in another newborn with E. coli meningitis intravenously receiving 49.6 mg/kg of CTRX twice daily for 25 days. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Mild eosinophilia was observed in 4 cases. Follow-up examinations of 3 of the 4 cases showed that these abnormal levels were returned to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - [Osteomyelitis and arthritis caused by Streptococcus group B in a 40-day-old boy].
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) have gained much attention in recent years as a cause  of serious infection in the newborn. Traditionally two clinical syndromes have been defined as "early onset", with fulminant septicemia, pneumonia and meningitis, and "late onset", with a mild meningitis. More recently some previously unrecognized clinical presentations of GBS disease have been documented. These include asymptomatic bacteremia, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, ethmoiditis with orbital cellulitis, pneumoniae with empyema, conjunctivitis. The literature to date reports 30 instances of osteomyelitis due to GBS. This report describes a forty days infant with a group B streptococcal osteomyelitis of the proximal humerus. Has been also emphasized the increased frequency and the benign clinical course of streptococcal osteomyelitis in the neonate.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - Type-specific streptococcal antibodies in amniotic fluid.
AB  - Type-specific antibodies against group B streptococcal and pneumococcal capsular  antigens were measured in 68 amniotic fluid samples from healthy women between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. Mean antibody levels ranged from 0.13 to 0.61 microgram/ml, with few samples having greater than 1 microgram/ml against any antigen. The role of antibodies in protection against intrauterine infection is discussed.
TI  - A two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  - There are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.
TI  - Activity of A-56268 compared with that of erythromycin and other oral agents against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-56268 was compared with erythromycin, roxithromycin (RU 28965), and perorally administered antimicrobial agents. Its in vitro activity was similar to that of erythromycin and slightly greater than that of roxithromycin, with beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae inhibited by less than 2 micrograms of A-56268 per ml (50% inhibited by 0.06 microgram/ml). Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. Pneumoniae, and S. faecalis resistant to erythromycin were resistant to A-56268, and 4 micrograms/ml inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide, compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against selected gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of A-56268 was determined and compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against a limited spectrum of 401 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. A-56268 was quite active against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci and was moderately active against Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. A-56268 was consistently bactericidal only for S. pneumoniae. The activity of A-56268 was comparable to that of erythromycin against most organisms tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CI934, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with coumermycin, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Cl934, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, was studied  against 314 strains of Gram-positive bacteria representing 6 genera: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. milleri, viridans streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Bacillus spp.; and compared with that of enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ampicillin, coumermycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifapentine, LM 427, erythromycin, minocycline, tetracycline and clindamycin. The agar dilution method was used. Cl934 was very active in vitro, with MIC90 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l against most species tested, except for S. faecalis and M. fortuitum. It was usually 2 to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. Cl934 was also tested by the killing curve method, alone and in combination with coumermycin. It was rapidly bactericidal against most species tested, including S. faecalis. A synergistic interaction was observed with coumermycin against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. milleri and S. faecalis. The only antagonistic interaction occurred against L. monocytogenes exposed to 8 X MIC of Cl934 with 2 X MIC of coumermycin.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - IgG subclasses and antibodies to group B streptococci, pneumococci, and tetanus toxoid in preterm neonates after intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin to the mothers.
AB  - High doses of intravenous immunoglobulin were given to seven pregnant women between the 27th and 36th wk of gestation who were at risk for preterm delivery. Determinations of IgG subclasses and of antibodies against group B streptococcal serotypes, pneumococcal polysaccharides, and tetanus toxoid were done in maternal serum before and after intravenous IgG infusion and after delivery in cord serum. Substantial transplacental passage of the infused material could be observed in five cases where delivery occurred at the 34th wk or later. After the 36th wk of gestation, IgG subclass and antibody concentrations in cord serum were increased up to the levels in the maternal serum.
TI  - Structure of a conjugative element in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We have cloned and mapped a 69-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome of Streptococcus pneumoniae DP1322, which carries the conjugative omega (cat-tet) insertion from S. pneumoniae BM6001. This element proved to be 65.5 kb in size. Location of the junctions was facilitated by cloning a preferred target region from the wild-type strain Rx1 recipient genome. This target site was preferred by both the BM6001 element and the cat-erm-tet element from Streptococcus agalactiae B109. Within the BM6001 element cat and tet were separated by 30 kb, and cat was flanked by two copies of a sequence that was also present in the recipient strain Rx1 DNA. Another sequence at least 2.4 kb in size was found inside the BM6001 element and at two places in the Rx1 genome. Its role is unknown. The ends of the BM6001 element appear to be the same as those of the B109 element, both as seen after transfer to S. pneumoniae and as mapped by others in pDP5 after transposition in Streptococcus faecalis. We see no homology between the ends of the BM6001 element and find no evidence suggesting that it ever circularizes.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of once daily ceftriaxone for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Fifty-seven patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with once daily ceftriaxone. After an initial loading dose of 100 mg/kg, the patients received 80 mg/kg as a single daily dose. Etiologic agents included: Haemophilus influenzae type b, 37 (11 beta-lactamase-positive); Neisseria meningitidis, 11; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Haemophilus influenzae type f, 1; and Group B Streptococcus, 1. All patients showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. Satisfactory cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal activity and drug concentrations were seen 24 hours after a dose even in those patients in whom repeat spinal taps were carried out following the last dose of therapy. The drug was well-tolerated and the major adverse effect seen was diarrhea in 20.4% of the patients. The diarrhea was mild and self-limited and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug although it was frequently associated with alterations in the stool microbiologic flora. Based on this preliminary experience, ceftriaxone, when given in a single daily dose, appears safe and effective in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in nonneonatal infants and children.
TI  - Coumermycin: in vitro activity against 251 clinical isolates of bacteria compared with the activities of eight other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin G and vancomycin. A total of 251 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by an agar dilution method. Clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. All the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. Netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active against S. epidermidis than against S. aureus. The MICs of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin G and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. Coumermycin showed poor activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and enterococci. Most of the S. pneumoniae isolates had also high MICs, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Common bacterial pneumonitis in infants. Determining the etiology and tailoring the treatment.
AB  - In infantile pneumonia, we recommend close attention to the history and physical  examination. Baseline studies, including CBC, ESR, blood cultures, and chest film, should be performed at onset and repeated as warranted. Nasopharyngeal secretions or washings should be drawn by means of gentle suction and specimens sent for Gram stain, fluorescent antibody stain for respiratory syncytial virus, and culture for bacteria and for viruses if possible. Acute and convalescent serum specimens should be obtained in serious cases to search for antibodies to RSV, adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, cytomegalovirus, and Chlamydia. Serum and urine specimens may be collected for countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and latex agglutination testing for Hemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and if indicated, group B streptococcus. If deterioration continues and all tests are negative, the clinician should consider a more invasive procedure such as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, needle aspiration, or open lung biopsy. While awaiting identification of the pathogen, the physician should institute empiric therapy with optimum doses of antimicrobials and monitoring of serum levels of drug. Often the clinician is faced with deterioration and a negative workup. In this situation, other agents may be added, such as antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoan, and antituberculous agents, as well as various antibiotics, to cover rare and unusual pathogens. Further consultation, even by phone, may at this point provide some insight into an otherwise confusing case.
TI  - Detection of bacterial antigens in body fluids by the Phadebact system.
AB  - 150 infected patients from 2 study centers had body fluids examined for presence  of bacterial antigens (group B streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type b) using the Pharmacia Phadebact system. The rates of detection of the pneumococcal antigens in the urine or serum of the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumococcal meningitis were 0.38, 0.47 and 0.5, respectively. The overall detection rate for H. influenzae infections was 0.92 and for group B streptococcal infections 0.87. Serum and urine from 100 non-infected patients were also tested for the presence of group B streptococcus, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae type b antigens with only 1 false positive (H. influenzae type b).
TI  - The aetiology of purulent meningitis in highland children: a bacteriological study.
AB  - Of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  March 1980 to September 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. Other pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), Streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella species (1 of each). Among H. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype I or II. Infections due to non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). Of 67 S. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml. The commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). No resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of H. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. The known case fatality rate in this study was 37%. More children with pneumococcal infection died (46%) than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than twelve months. There is an urgent need for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.
TI  - In vitro growth inhibition of mastitis causing bacteria by phenolics and metal chelators.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of three phenolic compounds and four metal chelators were tested at 0, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm in vitro against four major mastitis-causing bacteria, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Overall, butylated hydroxyanisole and tert-butylhydroquinone showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. These phenolics were bactericidal at 250 to 500 ppm against all four bacteria tested. The butylated hydroxytoluene was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but was ineffective against the coliforms. At 250 ppm, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but much less effective against the gram-negatives. However, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was more growth inhibitory than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid against the gram-negative bacteria and especially against Escherichia coli. All other compounds were generally much less effective or ineffective against all four microorganisms. Therefore, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid may have practical implications in the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.
TI  - [Serologic cross reactions of group B streptococci].
AB  - Group B streptococci contain sialic acid in their capsular polysaccharides thus resembling human and vertebrate glycoconjugates which are especially increased in human tumors. Sterical and conformational reasons are responsible for the fact, that certain streptococcal antigens do not react with antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, against these carbohydrate structures. The usefulness of lectins in detecting streptococcal antigens is demonstrated with antigalactans. In summary, the relationships between the biochemical structure of streptococcal antigens on one side and the serological reactivity on the other side are not evident a priori, because there are many cross-reactions which, although being expected, serologically do not take place.
TI  - The detection of streptococcal antigens using monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Recent advances in hybridoma technology have allowed the development of homogeneous immunologic reagents of defined specificity, activity, and reproducibility. During the last few years, the number of monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria has increased exponentially, and research investigations have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibody technology offers a rapid, specific diagnosis of bacterial infection, long before culture results are available. We have described the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) infections in mothers and infants at risk to develop invasive GBS disease. Specifically, we have used the anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to detect GBS colonization, serotype bacterial isolates in the laboratory, and identify GBS antigens in body fluid specimens. We have also discussed the use of anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to confer protection against fatal infection in mice. Monoclonal antibodies against group A streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been developed with the potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious and often life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. With further refinements in monoclonal antibody technology in the future, streptococcal hybridomas may replace standard culture techniques for bacterial identification in the microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B  (MLS) in streptococci.
AB  - Resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. Genes coding for MLS resistance are located on plasmids and one MLS resistance transposon has been described. MLS resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. Plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (Mdal) that code either for MLS or for both MLS and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Streptococcus faecalis) and G. These plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). One smaller non-conjugative MLS resistance plasmid has been isolated from Str. sanguis (4.5 Mdal). In group D (Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) streptococci, MLS resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). These multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. The MLS resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of Str. faecalis, are located on a transposon of 3.3 Mdal, Tn917. Hybridization studies, with MLS determinants as probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne MLS resistance sequences. Elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including MLS) in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Str. bovis), F, G, Str. pneumoniae, Str. mitis, Str. sanguis and Str. milleri. Strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid DNA. In some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. Such elements, from Str. pyogenes and Str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.
TI  - Prospective comparative trial of ceftriaxone vs. conventional therapy for treatment of bacterial meningitis in children.
AB  - Fifty children with bacterial meningitis were prospectively evaluated in a randomized comparative trial of twice daily ceftriaxone with conventional ampicillin and chloramphenicol therapy. The groups were comparable in age, sex, days of illness before admission, severity of illness at admission, etiology and admission cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters and bacterial colony counts. The pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae type b (34 beta-lactamase-negative, 8 beta-lactamase-positive); Streptococcus pneumoniae (4); Neisseria meningitidis (3); and Streptococcus agalactiae (1). Initial CSF colony counts ranged from 2.5 X 10(2) to 1 X 10(10) colony-forming units/ml. In 44 children a lumbar puncture was repeated 10.5 to 18 hours after starting treatment; 16 of 24 (67%) ceftriaxone patients and 12 of 20 (60%) conventional therapy patients had sterile cultures. The reduction in the CSF bacterial colony counts (6.3 log10 colony-forming units/ml) was similar in both groups. Ceftriaxone CSF levels ranged from 1.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml, representing a mean CSF penetration of 11.3% (range, 3.0 to 24.5%) of the simultaneous serum concentration. The median ceftriaxone bactericidal titer in CSF was 1:1024 compared with 1:4 achieved with conventional therapy. There were no significant differences in clinical responses or in frequency of complications, except for diarrhea which occurred in 59% of the ceftriaxone group and in 22% of the other (P less than 0.01). Despite one H. influenzae type b relapse occurring in the ceftriaxone group, ceftriaxone appears to be safe and as effective as conventional therapy for bacterial meningitis in children older than 2 months of age.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefminox in pediatric field].
AB  - Clinical studies on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) were conducted and the following results were obtained. Twelve cases of bacterial infections were treated with CMNX with a satisfactory result of "excellent" in 9 and "good" in 3. Antibacterial activity was examined in 7 cases. Pathogenic organisms which were S. aureus, beta-Streptococcus, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and P. morganii were eradicated in all the cases. Mean maximum serum concentrations of CMNX after intravenous injection of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg were 54.5 mcg/ml, 102.3 mcg/ml and 202.4 mcg/ml, respectively which were obtained 15 minutes after each injection. Mean half-lives of each dose group were 1.60, 1.13 and 1.51 hours, respectively. Mean urinary excretion rates of CMNX at 6 hours after intravenous injection in 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg groups were 73.5%, 80.9%, 92.6% and 66.5%, respectively. Side effects were not observed clinically, but anemia in 1 case and eosinophilia in 2 cases were noted in laboratory examination.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy with special reference to group B streptococci.
AB  - The relationship between significant bacteriuria (SB), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. From 30 (70%) of the 43 women with SB studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. The same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with Escherichia coli, the one with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with Staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. Six of 10 patients with group B streptococci (GBS), 1 of 4 patients with Streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. Serotype III was isolated from 8/10 patients with SB caused by GBS. One child born to a woman with GBS SB but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. The poor predictive value of SB with GBS, S. faecalis and S. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), i.e. AB with bacteria in the urinary bladder. SB with GBS even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Immediate postmortem cultures in an intensive care nursery.
AB  - The results of several published studies suggest that bacterial infection plays an important role in the mortality of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients. To evaluate more thoroughly this role we have routinely performed postmortem cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid on all infants who die in our NICU. During a 5-year review period 25.9% of infants who died had one or both cultures positive for an organism considered to be pathogenic in the neonate. The organisms most commonly cultured were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Group B Streptococcus. Of those infants who had positive postmortem cultures and who had an autopsy, 95% had histologic evidence of infection. Forty-three percent of our infants with positive postmortem cultures were not suspected of having a serious infection and had not received antibiotics before death. Postmortem cultures appeared to be helpful in identifying NICU patients in whom serious infection may have played a role in mortality. Unsuspected serious infection is a common finding in infants who die in a neonatal intensive care setting.
TI  - Exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  - The practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) for the selective isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and group D enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of SXT at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. For group D enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to the thymidine concentration. In contrast, the four viridans species studied (Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis II) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. For selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.
TI  - Successive extraction of specific protective immunoglobulins from pooled human sera.
AB  - By use of pooled human sera, specific protective immunoglobulins against the Smith-diffuse strain of Staphylococcus aureus, strains SS-620 and SS-619 of types III and II group B streptococci, and strain K-9 of Klebsiella pneumoniae were successively extracted from their whole cell and antibody complexes by elution with propionic acid containing 5% sucrose. Injection of 0.14, 0.05, 0.09, and 0.15 mg of these eluates in mice gave protection against lethal infection only with homologous strains. However, no protective effect was observed against these infections, even with considerably higher amounts of a conventional immunoglobulin preparation. The major components of the eluates were the three major immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM, although nonspecific proteins were also included. Protective activities of these eluates were absorbed out by their protection-inducing antigens, indicating that they contained specific protective immunoglobulins.
TI  - Gram's stains of tracheal secretions predict neonatal bacteremia.
AB  - The presence of bacteria in tracheal secretions stained by the Gram method was evaluated as a method of predicting neonatal bacteremia. The presence of bacteria had a 74% sensitivity and a 47% predictive accuracy in identifying neonates with bacteremia before 12 hours of age. The specificity in predicting newborns without bacteremia was 98%. In the same neonates, an immature neutrophil-total neutrophil ratio of 0.2 or more had a 77% sensitivity in predicting neonates with bacteremia. Neonates with bacteria in their blood and tracheal aspirates, who died shortly after birth, had pneumonia on postmortem examination. In newborns who have respiratory distress and a risk of infection at birth, Gram's stains of tracheal secretions are a practical and useful method of predicting congenital bacteremia.
TI  - [MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime, desacetylcefotaxime and ceftriaxone against four principal bacteria causing meningitis].
AB  - The MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (Des-CTX) and ceftriaxone (CTRX) were determined in relation to 4 of the principal bacterial species which cause meningitis, i.e., S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, H. influenzae and E. coli. These tests were performed using final inocula of 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml. Comparison was made with the MIC and MBC values of benzylpenicillin (PCG) and ampicillin (ABPC). 1. Against 25 strains of S. pneumoniae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.024 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml, respectively; and PCG, less than 0.012 micrograms/ml at both size. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.01 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.024 and 0.012 micrograms/ml, respectively. It is thus apparent that PCG showed the lowest values for both the MIC and MBC, followed by CTX, CTRX and then Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of S. agalactiae, the MIC 90 values with inocula of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values of Des-CTX were 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml, while the other 3 antibiotics showed the same values with both the 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml inocula: 0.10 micrograms/ml for CTX, 0.20 micrograms/ml for CTRX and 0.39 micrograms/ml for PCG. Accordingly, CTX showed the lowest values, followed by CTRX and then PCG being about the same as Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of H. influenzae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, 50 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 1.56 and 1.56 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, greater than 100 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. Accordingly, in terms of the MIC 90, CTX and CTRX showed the same values, but in terms of the MBC 90 CTX was superior. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Interaction of group B streptococcal type-specific polysaccharides with wheat germ agglutinin and other lectins.
AB  - The group B streptococci (GBS) are known to have type-specific polysaccharides rich in N-acetylneuraminic acid end groups, which are thought to be important immunological determinants. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) has affinity for N-acetylneuraminic acid as well as N-acetylglucosamine, and readily precipitates the type but not the group polysaccharide. A WGA-Sepharose affinity column was used to isolate complete type polysaccharides of representative strains of the 4 major GBS types. WGA, other lectins, and rabbit antisera were then used to characterize the products of various extraction procedures and chemical degradations, including mild acid hydrolysis and treatment with neuraminidase. Results of lectin binding studies were consistent with proposed chemical structures of types Ia, Ib and II. Differences were noted, however, between the cross-reactive antigens of pneumococcus type 14 and the desialated GBS type III polysaccharide. Although structurally similar, indirect evidence from lectin binding studies suggest that these antigens may not be identical.
TI  - Comparison of latex agglutination and immunofluorescence for direct Lancefield grouping of streptococci from blood cultures.
AB  - Simulated positive blood cultures with 84 known stock strains of streptococci were used to comparatively evaluate the direct identification of these organisms by fluorescein-tagged antibody staining (immunofluorescence [IF]) and latex agglutination (LA). IF was not evaluated for Lancefield group D strains (a total of 81 strains tested) and had 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. IF was least sensitive for the identification of Lancefield group F, in which three of seven strains showed no fluorescence with the group F reagent. Since LA was more convenient and revealed comparable sensitivities and specificities on 84 simulated cultures, we tested this procedure using an additional 29 fresh positive clinical blood cultures, for a total of 113 cultures tested by this technique. Of 11 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 9 reacted with the LA group C reagent, a problem not observed with IF. However, all these strains were identified by a rapid modified bile solubility test. Of the 12 Streptococcus faecalis strains, 4 were falsely negative with the group D reagent, but all were correctly identified by a rapid litmus milk reduction test. Of 12 group A strains, 1 was not detected. Of all 113 strains tested by LA, eliminating S. faecalis and S. pneumoniae, the sensitivity and specificity were 97 and 98%, respectively. LA was simple and reliable in the rapid identification of streptococci from blood cultures and appeared to be preferable to IF. When LA is used, the group D reagent should not be used, and all samples reacting with the group C reagent should be tested by a modified rapid bile solubility test to exclude S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card.
AB  - Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - Use of the Becton-Dickinson urine culture tube with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system.
AB  - Urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both Becton-Dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. Quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system. The time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. Isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from Becton-Dickinson tubes. By these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and Becton-Dickinson tubes. Escherichia coli (n = 72), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group B streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. Time for detection of positive urine samples was similar in both types of tubes. Delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. Antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by Becton-Dickinson tube transport. The MS-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. The Becton-Dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the MS-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.
TI  - An evaluation of latex particle agglutination to detect antigenemia in children.
AB  - Latex particle agglutination (LPA) was used to detect specific bacterial capsular antigen in sera collected at the time blood samples were taken from children with suspected bacteremia. Capsular polysaccharide antigens tested for were Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hi b), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), Streptococcus agalactiae (Sa) and Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) groups A and C. An adequate volume of serum was available for 1085 of the blood culture sets received. Antigenemia was detected in 47 children; 36 children from whom the homologous microorganism was isolated from the associated blood culture and 11 children who had prior antibiotic therapy and whose blood culture grew no microorganism. Antigenemia was not detected in 46 children whose blood culture yielded a bacterium for which a homologous LPA reagent was available. Fifty children had positive blood cultures with microorganisms considered significant to which no LPA reagent was available. LPA was of value as a rapid diagnostic test in the identification of the etiological agent in severe infectious disease in children.
TI  - Quantitation of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of children with meningitis and its diagnostic significance.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from pediatric patients with meningitis were  examined for their concentration of microbes and the relationship of this count to the bacteremia levels, microscopy results, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration. A total of 2,031 consecutive CSF specimens were analyzed, of which 63 (3.1%) were positive by culture from the same number of patients. We observed that 85% of the total CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis had counts in excess of 10(3) CFU/ml, with 56% of the specimens exceeding 10(5) CFU/ml. A correlation existed between the number of organisms present in the CSF and blood. For example, from a total of 22 patients who had counts of H. influenzae greater than 10(3) CFU/ml in the CSF, 16 or 73% had levels of bacteremia greater than 10(3) CFU/ml. It was also noted that the bacterial concentration had a profound effect on the sensitivity of microscopy. The percentage of positive results increased from 25% with less than or equal to 10(3) CFU/ml to 60% in the range of greater than 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/ml and to 97% at concentrations of greater than 10(5) CFU/ml. Furthermore, a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) was noted between the concentration of bacteria in the CSF and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes observed on microscopy.
TI  - Evaluation of the Phadebact CSF test for detection of the four most common causes of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - A five-center collaborative study was undertaken to determine the suitability of  the Phadebact CSF test kit and the Phadebact group B Streptococcus reagent for routine use by clinical laboratories to detect antigens of common organisms causing bacterial meningitis. The kits employ staphylococcal protein A coagglutination to detect the antigens of Haemophilus influenzae types a, b, c, d, e, and f, Neisseria meningitidis groups A, B, C, Y, and W135, Streptococcus pneumoniae (83 serotypes), and group B Streptococcus. A total of 2,817 individual tests were performed on 577 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. The percent positive specimens detected by coagglutination was as follows: overall, 84%; H. influenzae, 97%; group B Streptococcus, 75%; S. pneumoniae, 71%; and N. meningitidis, 58%. Eighty-five of the specimens were also tested by counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Coagglutination was more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis because it detected 74% of the positive specimens, whereas counterimmunoelectrophoresis detected only 65%. No false-positive results were obtained with coagglutination. The Phadebact CSF test kit is recommended for routine use in screening cerebrospinal fluid samples for antigens of the common organisms causing bacterial meningitis along with the Gram stain and culture for delayed confirmation of the rapid results.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of the nose and external ear canal in newborn infants.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and external ear canal of 132 newborn infants, aged 3 days and 4 to 7 days, was examined. Cultures taken from the nose showed the following pattern of bacterial colonization: normal flora (39%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (23%); gram-negative enteric rods (16%); and sterile cultures (22%). The most frequent bacterial cultures from nostrils were Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%); Staph. aureus (11%) and Escherichia coli (8%). The cultures from the external ear canal showed normal flora (37%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (5%); gram-negative enteric rods (24%); and sterile cultures (34%). The most frequent bacteria cultured from the ear canal were: Staph. epidermidis (37%); E. coli (8%); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%). Of several factors studied, the type of delivery, Apgar score and the duration of hospitalization were found to have a significant influence on the pattern of bacterial colonization.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). PBPs with similar properties are carried by strains of Streptococcus durans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The strains carrying the slow-reacting PBP demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. Spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from S. faecium ATCC 9790. They all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting PBP produced. Mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of S. durans, S. faecalis, and S. faecium. All of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting PBP than that carried by the parent. Finally, it was found that resistant S. faecium ATCC 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all PBPs except PBP 5. Cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting PBP by 90%. This penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Association of bacterial carbohydrate-specific cold agglutinin antibody production with immunization by group C, group B type III, and Streptococcus pneumoniae type XIV streptococcal vaccines.
AB  - Rabbits immunized with group B type III, group C, and Streptococcus pneumoniae type XIV streptococcal vaccines developed autoantibodies reactive with autologous and isologous erythrocytes and human O-positive erythrocytes at reduced temperatures. The cold agglutinin antibodies were present in both the immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG fractions of group C streptococcal antiserum and in the IgM fraction of group B type III and S. pneumoniae type XIV antisera. BALB/c, CF1, and local strains of mice immunized with group B type III and S. pneumoniae type XIV streptococcal vaccines also produced a cold agglutinin antibody reactive with rabbit and human erythrocytes. The cold agglutinin antibodies were reactive with saccharide compounds representative of the determinants present on the individual bacterial carbohydrate structures, individual vaccine preparations, and isolated polysaccharides. The group C antibodies in rabbits were reactive with sugar ligands in the following order: N-acetylgalactosamine greater than melibiose greater than lactose greater than galactose greater than glucose. Group B type III and S. pneumoniae type XIV cold agglutinin antibodies in rabbit antisera, however, displayed reactivities different from group C antibodies and from each other. Group B type III antibodies reacted with galactose greater than lactose greater than N-acetylgalactosamine greater than glucose greater than rhamnose; S. pneumoniae type XIV antibodies reacted with lactose greater than melibiose greater than galactose greater than glucose greater than N-acetylgalactosamine. The same relative ligand specificity was observed for the cold agglutinin antibodies in S. pneumoniae type XIV mouse antisera. The cold agglutinin antibodies in group B type III and S. pneumoniae type XIV antiserum reacted with erythrocytes at higher temperatures (up to 31 degrees C) than did group C antibodies (up to 14 degrees C). In addition, S. pneumoniae type XIV antibodies did not discriminate between I- or i-bearing human erythrocytes to a significant extent. The results obtained provide substantial evidence that autoreactive cold agglutinin antibodies produced by immunization with these vaccines represent subpopulations of bacterial carbohydrate-specific antibodies that cross-react with mammalian carbohydrate structures.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Intramammary infections in primigravid heifers near parturition.
AB  - Mammary secretion from 32 primigravid heifers was obtained aseptically to determine frequency of bacterial isolation and incidence of intramammary infection near parturition. Quarter samples were collected 14 and 7 days prior to expected parturition, at parturition, and 7 and 14 days postparturition. Analysis of culture data indicated that 77.1% of samples were bacteriologically negative, and 15.7% contained coagulase negative staphylococci, 4.4% streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 3.8% coliforms, .8% coagulase positive staphylococci, and .1% Corynebacterium bovis. Frequency of bacterial isolation was highest in samples obtained prior to and at parturition. Thirty-five of 128 quarters were infected at parturition. Twenty-six of the 35 infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, 4 by streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 by coliforms, and 1 by coagulase positive staphylococci. Twenty infections were observed during the early postpartum period. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections decreased markedly. However, the number and type of primary pathogen infections during early lactation were similar to those at parturition.
TI  - Susceptibility of bovine mammary gland to infections during the dry period.
AB  - Quarter foremilk samples (1,574) were collected for bacteriological analysis from 40 cows during late lactation, early involution, prior to parturition, parturition, and during early lactation. Six of 160 quarters were infected with major pathogens during late lactation. Twelve new infections occurred during early involution. Twenty-two quarters were infected at parturition. Of these infections, 12 occurred after early involution, and 10 infections that originated during early involution persisted throughout the dry period. During early lactation, 21 major pathogen infections were observed. Nine occurred after calving, and 12 persisted from parturition. Most major pathogen infections (93.8%) were caused by coliforms and streptococcal species other than Streptococcus agalactiae. Numbers of streptococcal infections were highest at parturition and early lactation. Numbers of quarters infected with coliforms were similar during early involution, parturition, and early lactation. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections increased during the dry period, whereas Corynebacterium bovis infected quarters decreased. Udder infections were few in cows completing first or second dry periods. The incidence of udder infection was highest in cows completing third or later dry periods.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefotiam against clinical isolates in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) against clinically isolated organisms in the field of obstetrics and gynecology was discussed as follows: In the point of view of the MICs peak, CTM was 1-fold worse than CEZ against Gram-positive bacteria, while, in the case of the concentration of CTM required to inhibit the growth of 80% or 90% of the total number of tested Gram-positive organism, antibacterial activity of CTM was approximately identical with that of CEZ, CMZ or SBPC. CTM against E. coli, K, pneumoniae, P. Mirabilis was 16-32-fold more effective than CEZ and 4-16-fold than CMZ. Against indole-positive organisms with CEZ was no effective, CTM was considerably effective. But antibacterial activity of CTM against B. fragilis was insufficient. However, in the case that no spore forming anaerobic organism involved in infectious disease, it is said that existence of aerobic organism is important. As E. coli is representative of aerobic organism, CTM with potent antibacterial activity against this organism is seemed to be effective antibiotic for the gynecological infection.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of new cephem antibiotics against clinical isolates.  A comparison of the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime with 6 other antibiotics].
AB  - During the period from May through July 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftizoxime (CZX), cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). CTX and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. The clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order: urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. Concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. This was followed by E. coli and E. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and C. freundii and E. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. In relation to S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, CTX showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was CZX. CMZ and LMOX were found to show relatively high MIC values for those species. Against S. aureus, CEZ showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. With regard to Gram-negative bacteria, CTX and CZX showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for P. aeruginosa. These were followed, in order, by LMOX and CPZ. Compared with these 4 antibiotics, CTM, CMZ and CEZ were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. In relation to P. aeruginosa, the peak of the MIC distribution for CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. This was followed by CTX (25 micrograms/ml) LMOX (25 micrograms/ml) and CZX (50 micrograms/ml). CTM had an MIC of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of P. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. All of the strains were resistant to CMZ and CEZ, showing MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. For each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the MIC and the serogroup for either P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of purulent meningitis].
AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid of 589 subjects, 78 of whom were suffering from a purulent meningitis were examined. Comparatively by classical bacteriological techniques (direct examination and culture) and by electro-immunodiffusion, latex agglutination, and Limulus endotoxin assay. Soluble bacterial Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens, were tested by electro-immunodiffusion and latex agglutination, and soluble bacterial N. meningitidis group B, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae antigens by electro-immunodiffusion. Specific antigens and endotoxin were found in 75.8 per cent of the specimens with a rapid answer (120 min). The three tests revealed also only the diagnosis in 29.1 per cent of cases of pneumococcal meningitis, in 33.3 per cent of meningococcal meningitis and in 47 per cent of Gram-negative bacteria meningitis. Only five cerebrospinal fluid from the 589 specimens tested were given a non-specific reaction. These two advantages--sensitivity and specificity--of these three tests render them techniques of the future in the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.

TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive cocci was studied by microdilution broth susceptibility tests and compared with the activities of clindamycin, vancomycin, oxacillin, and ampicillin. U-57930E inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus viridans at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. This degree of activity was generally slightly less than that of the other antimicrobial agents tested. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci were resistant to U-57930E. At the concentrations used, U-57930E exhibited bactericidal activity against most susceptible organisms, and a minimal effect of inoculum size was noted.
TI  - The presence of sialic acid on two related bacterial polysaccharides determines the site of the primary immune response and the effect of complement depletion on the response in mice.
AB  - We have examined the antibody responses in mice to two structurally similar antigens: the capsular polysaccharide of type 3 group B streptococci (sssGBS 3) and the capsular polysaccharide of type 14 pneumococci (sssPn 14), which differ only in the presence of a terminal sialic acid on the side chain of the former. The cells that produce antibody to the nonsialated antigen (sssPn 14) reside in the spleen, whereas the cells that produce antibody to the sialated antigen (sssGBS 3) do not. Cobra venom factor treatment of the mice before immunization abrogates the antibody response to the nonsialated antigen, but does not affect the response to the sialated antigen.
TI  - Heterogeneity of tetracycline resistance determinants in Streptococcus.
AB  - We found that naturally occurring tetracycline resistance in streptococci is encoded by more than one genetic determinant. Two of these distinct determinants were cloned, and the regions that are necessary and sufficient for expression of tetracycline resistance were defined by deletion analysis. These cloned determinants were further characterized by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments which also identified a third genetically unrelated tetracycline resistance determinant. Some of these genetic differences appear to represent mechanistic differences. The tetL determinant was associated with small nonconjugative plasmids and mediated resistance to tetracycline. The tetM determinant was most often "nonplasmid" associated and mediated resistance to minocycline as well as tetracycline. The tetN determinant was represented on a large conjugative plasmid and was genetically distinct from tetL and tetM, although phenotypically it resembled tetM.
TI  - Effects of washing on the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis.
AB  - Six stallions were subjected to extensive cleansing of the penis and prepuce with water, Ivory Soap and water, or Betadine surgical scrub and water. The stallions were all washed for 14 days, and then allowed 14 days respite. This pattern of washing and resting was repeated consecutively. Swabs were taken from all 7 stallions twice weekly and semen was collected once a week for bacteriological examination. All forms of cleansing altered the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis; the Ivory Soap tended to encourage the replacement of the normal flora with coliform organisms, while Betadine favoured the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. This experiment showed that the systematic washing of a stallion's penis will cause the normal flora to be replaced with pathogens and potential pathogens.
TI  - Pivmecillinam in complicated urinary infections failing to respond to conventional therapy.
AB  - Forty-three patients with a history of recurrent urinary infections, many of whom had renal involvement and had recently failed treatment, were then treated with pivmecillinam (400 mg 8-hourly for seven days). One week after the end of treatment the bacteriological cure rate was 72.1%. During the following four weeks, however, several of the cured patients relapsed, so that the cure rate five weeks after the end of treatment was only 46%. Thus, it is recommended that such patients should begin prophylactic treatment if found to be abacteriuric after the one week follow-up. Pivmecillinam was extremely well tolerated.
TI  - Type III group B streptococcal strain differences in susceptibility to opsonization with human serum.
AB  - Human serum opsonins to type III Group B streptococci (GBS) were studied in an in vitro opsonophagocytic assay. Two type III GBS test strains were susceptible (893 and IIINor) and two resistant (891 and 892) to opsonization by the majority of sera from 15 healthy adults. Four individuals with undetectable or low opsonic titers to the test strains were immunized with pneumococcal vaccine; immunization with pneumococcal vaccine induced a titer rise in all but one instance when susceptible GBS strains were tested. In contrast, only a single titer rise was detected when resistant GBS strains were employed in the test. These results indicate that immunization with a cross-reacting antigen (identical to core antigen of type III GBS) fails to induce opsonic antibody to all strains of type III GBS. A resistant strain was made highly susceptible to neutrophil killing in vitro by exposure to neuramindase prior to incubation with opsonic serum. Using a fluorescent lectin-binding assay, this enzyme appeared to remove surface sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is an antiphagocytic factor. However, the possibility that other surface moieties may act as antiphagocytic factors cannot be ruled out. Both opsonic susceptible and resistant strains absorbed opsonic antibody from serum, which suggests that the GBS antiphagocytic factors do not prevent binding of antibody to resistant bacteria. These findings indicate that demonstration of serum opsonic activity to one strain of type III GBS may not accurately depict opsonic activity to other strains. In addition, immunization with core antigen did not enhance opsonic activity against all GBS strains. These data also point out the need to use assays which measure functional antibody, since demonstration of antibody binding may not reflect its ability to facilitate bacterial phagocytosis and killing.
TI  - Lack of stimulation of isohemagglutinin antibodies by immunization with group B streptococcal (type III) vaccine.
AB  
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Etiologic agents of meningitis in early life.
AB  
TI  - Homology among tet determinants in conjugative elements of streptococci.
AB  - A mutation to tetracycline sensitivity in a resistant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was shown by several criteria to be due to a point mutation in the conjugative omega (cat-tet) element found in the chromosomes of strains derived from BM6001, a clinical strain resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Strains carrying the mutation were transformed back to tetracycline resistance with the high efficiency of a point marker by donor deoxyribonucleic acids from its ancestral strain and from nine other clinical isolates of pneumococcus and by deoxyribonucleic acids from group D Streptococcus faecalis and group B Streptococcus agalactiae strains that also carry conjugative tet elements in their chromosomes. It was not transformed to resistance by tet plasmid deoxyribonucleic acids from either gram-negative or gram-positive species, except for one that carried transposon Tn916, the conjugative tet element present in the chromosomes of some S. faecalis strains. The results showed that the tet determinants in conjugative elements of several streptococcal species share a high degree of deoxyribonucleic acid sequence homology and suggested that they differ from other tet genes.
TI  - Streptococcal infections in pregnancy. A study of 48 bacteremias.
AB  - During a 4-year period, 48 obstetric patients with aerobic streptococcal bacteremia were identified. The isolates were group B (31); group D, enterococci (5); group A (4); group D, not enterococci (3); Streptococcus pneumoniae (3); and viridans streptococci (2). The most common diagnoses were endometritis (36) and chorioamnionitis (8). For all streptococcal genital infections, the clinical presentation included early-onset fever, often with few localizing signs. Only one patient had a chronic debilitating disease. There was an excellent correlation between genital and bloodstream isolates (36 of 42). Maternal response to therapy was good, with no deaths nor episodes of septic shock. Possible infectious complications developed in two fetuses and four neonates. The microbiologic and clinical features of aerobic streptococci were reviewed, and the outcome in obstetric patients and that in other adults were compared.
TI  - Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for rapid diagnosis of bacteremia and bacterial meningitis.
AB  
TI  - Minimum number of bacteria needed for antigen detection by counterimmunoelectrophoresis: in vivo and in vitro studies.
AB  - Threshold concentrations of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Streptococcus sp. group B type Ib required for positive counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions were determined in vivo and in vitro. Animals were infected intraperitoneally with various concentrations of microorganisms: adult mice with S. pneumoniae, suckling rats with H. influenzae, and 3-week-old mice with Streptococcus sp. group B. At 24 h after infection a minimum blood concentration of 10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml was needed for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae before antigen was detected in the serum. A minimum concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml was needed for Streptococcus sp. group B at 10 h after infection. Larger threshold concentrations (10(4) CFU/ml for S. pneumoniae, 10(5) CFU/ml for H. influenzae, and 10(7) CFU/ml for Streptococcus) were required in broth-grown cultures before cell-free antigens could be demonstrated by counterimmunoelectrophoresis in the medium. Marked levels of antigen release by group B streptococci were observed as the cultures entered early stationary phase. This study provides evidence of a long-accepted, though poorly substantiated, hypothesis that a threshold concentration of microorganism is necessary before counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions become positive. Counterimmunoelecrophoresis results for clinical specimens should be interpreted cautiously in light of this evidence.
TI  - Experimental infection of bovine mammary glands with Streptococcus agalactiae during the nonlactating period.
AB  - Two experiments were done to determine the rate of intramammary infection (IMI) in dairy cows during the nonlactating period. In experiment 1, all glands were equally exposed to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae for the first 3 weeks after the start of the nonlactating period. Nearly all new IMI was caused by S agalactiae. In experiment 2, the susceptibility of nonlactating mammary glands to new IMI by S agalactiae after direct inoculation into the lactiferous sinus was determined. During the 1st month of the nonlactating period, 30% of inoculated glands became infected. During the last month of the nonlactating period, 90% of inoculated glands became infected.
TI  - Antibody response to group B streptococcus type III and AB blood group antigens induced by pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - The effect of pneumococcal vaccination on antibodies to Streptococcus pneumoniae  type 14, group B streptococcus type III, and AB blood group antigens was studied in 40 vaccinated adults. Fourfold or greater increases in type-specific IgG antibody to Pn-14 were found in 26 of 40 vaccines (mean increase 6.4-fold) and against GBS-III in 16 of the 40 (mean increase 2.9-fold) by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. However, only six of the 26 vaccinees with low levels (titers less than or equal to 20) of GBS-III antibody in prevaccination sera developed titers greater than 20 after vaccination. Thus, vaccination with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine does not reliably induce high levels of IF antibody to GBS-III. Fourfold or greater increases in IgG isohemagglutinins against blood group A cells were also found in 22 of 27 vaccines (mean increase 4.5-fold) and against blood group B cells in nine of 34 (mean increase 1.7-fold) using the indirect anti-human globulin test. Chromatographic fractionation of selected sera confirmed that the anti-A isohemagglutinins stimulated in group O subjects were of the IgG class. Thus, pneumococcal vaccination during incompatible pregnancy could potentiate AO hemolytic disease of the newborn infant.
TI  - Effect of CSF on bacterial growth.
AB  - The growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (S epidermidis) were compared using CSF, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and a phosphate buffer. Each grew less in CSF than in TSB. Escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between CSF and TSB at 24 hours of growth, whereas S epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. The differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for E. coli. Similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. The non-support of bacterial growth by CSF may constitute a host defense mechanism. The basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the CSF.
TI  - Influence of preimmunization antibody levels on the specificity of the immune response to related polysaccharide antigens.
AB  - We studied the influence of preimmunization antibody level on the immune response of adults to one of two structurally related yet immunologically distinct type-specific polysaccharides from Type III Group B streptococcus and Type 14 pneumonococcus. Four weeks after immunization with multivalent pneumococcal vaccine, 20 subjects with low levels of antibody to Type III Group B streptococcus antigen had no significant increase in antibody to this antigen (P greater than 0.05), but all volunteers with moderate to high preimmunization antibody levels who were immunized with Pneumovax had significant increases (P less than 0.01). However, the streptococcal antibody response to pneumococcal Type 14 antigen was weaker and briefer than that in 10 adults given Type III Group B streptococcus vaccine(P less than 0.05). Preimmunization antibody levels influenced the immune response to a structurally similar polysaccharide antigen, but specific Type III polysaccharide antigen appeared necessary to induce a primary antibody response in "nonimmune" adults. We conclude that immunization of mothers with pneumococcal vaccine is not likely to prevent neonatal Type III Group B streptococcal infection, despite immunologic similarities between the two organisms.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of multiple antibiotic resistance markers in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Two antibiotic-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were investigated for conjugative transfer of their drug resistance markers into streptococcal (groups B and D) and pneumococcal (encapsulated and non-encapsulataed) recipients. Of these, 7 wild-type donor pneumococci transferred all their resistance markers (except Pc [penicillin], Su [sulfonamide], and Tp [trimethoprim]) into group D Streptococcus and non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae recipients at a low frequency (10(-5) to 10(-6)). The resistance markers transferred were Tc (tetracycline); Tc and Cm (chloramphenicol); Tc and MLS (macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B); Tc, MLS, Km (kanamycin), and Cm. The transconjugants obtained retransferred their resistance markers into appropriate streptococcal or pneumococcal recipients or both. The resistance markers of streptococcal transconjugants could not be cured by chemical agents. All attempts to detect extra-chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid from pneumococcal or streptococcal transconjugants were unsuccessful. The molecular weight of a streptococcal conjugative R plasmid (pIP501) was investigated after transfer into the non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae recipient and was found to be similar to that of the wild-type group B Streptococcus host (20 x 10(6)).
TI  - Culture-negative septic arthritis and bacterial endocarditis. Diagnosis by synovial biopsy.
AB  - The capacity of bacterial endocarditis to mimic other systemic illnesses is well  known. This report describes a patient with blood culture-negative bacterial endocarditis who presented with features suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. Despite sterile synovial fluid, synovial biopsy culture resulted in identification of the causative organism and led to specific antibiotic therapy and cure. This is the first report of such a case.
TI  - Transferability of macrolide, lincomycin, and streptogramin resistances between group A, B, and D streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The transferability of plasmid pRI405 between various streptococci of groups A, B, and D, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus is described. pRI405 originated from Streptococcus faecalis and encodes for resistance to macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B (MLS resistance). The host range of the well-documented streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 was found to be similar to that of pRI405. Cleavage with restriction enzymes suggests that pRI405 belongs to a related family of MLS resistance plasmids.
TI  - [Haemolytic streptococci of the serological group B and pneumococci - new life-threatening bacteria in newborn wards (author's transl)].
AB  - In 1978 353 premature and mature newborns were admitted to our neonatal and intensive care unit. 34 children developed bacterial infections. B-streptococci were the offending organisms in 6 cases, pneumococci in 1 case, 5 of these 7 infections were of the early-onset type, 2 of the late-onset type. The early-onset type disease manifests itself by respiratory distress and shock. It is transmitted vertically from mother to child before or during birth. 3 of our 5 affected children died. The late-onset type disease occurs after 5-10 days, is transmitted as horizontal, mostly nosocomial infection, and presents as sepsis with meningitis or - as in one of our cases - with osteomyelitis. In addition to the 7 sick infants 8 of the 353 admitted newborns were colonized without signs of disease. Early diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis of these infections present still unsolved problems.

TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and clinical experiences of the combination sulfadiazine-trimethoprim in the short-term treatment of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of sulfadiazine (SD) combined in a small dose (250 mg) with  trimethoprim (TMP, 160 mg) and given twice daily were studied in eight healthy subjects. Both drugs were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and their concentrations in serum as well as in urine could be considered high enough for the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (UTI). In none of the subjects did the concentration of SD in urine exceed the experimental limit established for crystallization of the drug. Serum half-lives of SD and TMP were 10.8 and 11.8 hrs, respectively. In microbiological assay synergistic interaction was found in human urine with both the combination of SD + TMP and SM (sulfamethoxazole) + TMP on all the tested strains of E. coli, Str. faecalis, Str. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. A double-blind clinical trial was carried out with patients having acute UTI, using either the combination SD + TMP (250 mg + 160 mg) or the combination SM + TMP (800 mg + 160 mg) twice daily for one week. The results of the treatment were equally successful in both groups. Treatment failed in only 4 out of 85 cases, although in 12 cases the causative micro-organism was resistant in vitro to the combination of SM + TMP.
TI  - Properties and transforming activities of two plasmids in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Two plasmids from group B streptococcus were introduced into pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and examined for copy number, stability, and some features of the process by which they transform pneumococcal recipients. The 3.6 Mdal pMV158 (tet) was present at a minimum of 12 to 16 copies per chromosome and was never observed to be cured. The 20 Mdal pIP501 (cat erm) had a minimum copy number of 3 to 4 per chromosome and was lost spontaneously at a frequency near 0.03 per division. The presence of novobiocin increased this frequency 2 to 3-fold. Competence for chromosomal transformation and the membrane endonuclease needed for normal DNA entry were required for plasmid transformation. Plasmid transformants segregated transformed cells one generation ahead of chromosomal transformants. Both single and multiple hit components of the transformation reaction kinetics were observed, but the latter could not be seen in the presence of competing chromosomal DNA. The major of the transforming activity behaved as covalently closed circular DNA in dye-buoyancy gradients. Although most of the activity for both plasmids sedimented in sucrose gradients more rapidly than did monomeric closed circular DNA, a significant fraction was found at a position suggesting that it may have been due to monomeric plasmids.
TI  - Mastitis: II. Evaluation of antimicrobial amines for use as teat dips.
AB  - Recent proposals by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate teat dips as drugs have led to a search for safer teat dip ingredients. Primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines (carbon-10 to -18 chain length) inhibit growth of mastitic bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichi coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in a broth tube culture assay. Since carbon-13 compounds were active, a carbon-13 primary (tridecanamine hydrochloride), secondary methyl (N-methyltridecanamine), secondary ethyl (N-ethyltridecanamine), tertiary dimethyl amine (N, N-dimethyltridecanamine), and carbon-12 quaternary amine (N, N, -trimethyldodecaneammonium chloride) were tested for their ability to reduce experimentally applied populations of S. agalactiae or E. coli on the bovine teat surface. The five compounds were compared at concentrations of 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,000, and 10,000 ppm. Activity was greater against the gram-positive S. agalactiae than against the gram-negative E. coli. The tertiary amine was most active, producing a log reduction of 4 (reduction of bacterial number from 10(6) to 10(2)) at a concentration of 3,000 ppm in the teat dip. The relative order of effectiveness for the amines was: dimethyl tertiary greater than methyl secondary greater than ethyl secondary greater than primary = quaternary. The results suggest that these amines may be useful as potent, effective antibacterial agents for incorporation into teat dips.
TI  - [Clinical differentiation between idiopathic respiratory distress, neonatal septicemia caused by group B streptococci and septicemia caused by other pathogens (author's transl)].
AB  - Since bacterial infection in newborns must be treated as specifically and as early as possible, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of suspected infection based on clinical symptoms and to take possible pathogens into consideration when choosing therapy. RDS and septicemia with Group B streptococci can present very similar clinical symptoms, but leucopenia on the first day of life is most probably an indication of septicemia with Group B streptococci. Septicemia caused by other pathogens, however, usually has a much later onset. In the days following birth a raised cardiothoracic index indicates RDS. Other differential criteria are being investigated.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Defective activation of the third component of complement in the sera of newborn  infants.
AB  - The activation of the terminal complement components, C3--9, plays an important role in the host's defense against infection. In the present study, the ability of bacteria to activate the third component of complement (C3) in newborn serum was examined. A variety of bacteria were incubated in test sera at 37 degrees C for 30 min and the percent of available C3 that was activated was measured. Using one strain of Escherchia coli (no. 3), 32% (mean) of the available C3 was activated in sera from 18 newborns, as compared to 85% in sera from their mothers and 79% in sera from 13 normal adults (P less than 0.005). In contrast, using another strain of E. coli (N70), the percent of C3 activated in newborn sera (83%) was the same as in sera from their mothers (81%) or in sera from normal adults (73%). The defective activation of C3 in newborn sera by E. coli was not related to the presence of the K1 antigen. Newborn sera were also challenged with other bacterial species and the activation of C3 was deficient when tested with klebsiellae, but not with staphylococci or streptococci. The defect in newborn sera appeared to be due to a deficiency of a serum factor rather than to the presence of an inhibitor.
TI  - Susceptibility of streptococci to newer tetracyclines and cephalosporins and to other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty-nine strains of Streptococcus including 71 strains of Group A, 81 strains of Group B, 69 strains of enterococci, and 18 strains of S. pneumoniae were tested against 12 antimicrobial agents using an agar dilution method. Cefamandole was the most active cephalosporin tested. Doxycycline and minocycline were more active than tetracycline, although the tetracyclines were considerably less inhibitory than the cephalosporins. Regression line analysis of zones of inhibition versus minimal inhibitory concentration values for tetracycline and minocycline showed the tetracycline disc to be unacceptable for predicting the susceptibility of the Group A Streptococcus to minocycline. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, and spectinomycin are also given.
TI  - Neonatal lung abscess. A report of six cases.
AB  - Six infants 8 weeks of age or younger had lung abscesses treated in our medical center during the 20-year period of from 1957 to 1977. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, the etiologic organisms, and the therapeutic approach differ from those in older children and adults. The pathogenic organisms were Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, initial therapy with a penicillin and an aminoglycoside are indicated until identification and susceptibility results are available on the organism isolated from the abscess cavity. Previously undiagnosed cystic malformations of the lung were seen in two of the six patients. Surgical intervention is usually required in this age group.
TI  - Immunochemical cross-reactions between type III group B Streptococcus and type 14 Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Serological cross-reactions between certain streptococci and some serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported. These studies detail the serological cross-reactivity observed between hot HCl-extracted group b streptococcus type III (GBS III) antigens and S. pneumoniae type 14 (Pn 14) polysaccharide. Similar electrophoretic migration patterns of GBS III and Pn 14 were observed when either type-specific BGS III antisera or pneumococcal omniserum was utilized to precipitate these antigens. Both the GBS III antigen and the Pn 14 polysaccharide migrated toward the cathode, whereas all other pneumococcal polysaccharides migrated toward the anode. No cross-reactions were observed between GBS III antisera and the 11 other types of pneumococcal polysaccharides. Lines of identity were observed between type-specific GBS III antisera and monospecific Pn 14 antiserum with either GBS III antigens or purified Pn 14 polysaccharide. The cross-reacting antigens of GBS III and Pn 14 appear to be identical by immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.
TI  - Mastitis: I. In vitro antimicrobial activity of alkyl amines against mastitic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of branched and straight chain amines (10 to 18 carbons chain length) were compared in inhibiting the growth of five microorganisms that cause about 95% of bovine mastitis. Three gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria were used in a trypticase soy broth tube culture growth assay. Sixty-two compounds were screened at concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ppm in broth culture to determine the effective minimum inhibitory concentration. Alkyl secondary N-substituted monoethyl [CH3(CH2)nNHCH2CH3] and tertiary N,N-substituted dimethyl [CH3(CH2) nN(CH3)2] amines with chain lengths of 11 to 14 carbon atoms were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Antimicrobial activity against gram-positive organisms increased with increasing chain length and carbon-14 to 18 amines were active at 1 to 5 ppm. The carbon-11 to 13 alkyl amines were most active against gram-positive organisms; longer chain amines (more than 14 carbons) were inactive. Branching of the alkyl chain caused a loss of activity against gram-negative but not against gram-positive bacteria. Antimicrobial testing of monoamines, polyamines, and the influence of order substituents were investigated to correlate structure-acitivity relationships.
TI  - [Rapid methods useful for determination of streptococcal groups with special reference to streptococci of groups B and D].
AB  - A study was carried out on the efficiency of certain rapid methods for the identification of streptococcal groups, especially groups B and D, methods based upon physiologic properties such as hippurate hydrolysis, production of pigment, esculin hydrolysis, tolerance to salt and bilolysis, associated with the classical tests, for instance the hemolysis type and sensitivity to bacitracin and optochin. By these tests, accessible to hospital laboratories, a number of 3083 streptococcal strains were correctly identified within 2 to 18 hours, of which 2567 group A, 31 group B, 184 group C, G, 113 group D, 155 Str. pneumoniae and 31 viridans, strains isolated from pathological products.
TI  - Immunodeterminant specificity of human immunity to type III group B streptococcus.
AB  - The type III polysaccharides of group B Streptococcus in its native state chemically consists of glucose, galactose, glucosamine, and sialic acid. The core of this polysaccharide lacks sialic acid and precipitates with type III antiserum to give a partial identity with the precipitate between the native antigen and this serum. The core determinant is immunochemically similar to the capsular polysaccharide of type XIV Streptococcus pneumoniae, while the native type III group B streptococcal polysaccharide does not cross-react with type XIV pneumococcal antiserum. In human sera, it is antibody directed to the native antigen which correlates very highly with opsonic immunity (r = 0.94) while a poorer correlation exists between antibody to the core antigen and opsonins (r = 0.51 P less than 0.001). In natural infections, as association exists between low levels of maternal antibody to the native antigen and risk of disease in the infant. This association is not true for antibody to the core structure, where both infected infants and their mothers have much higher levels of antibody to the core than the native antigens. Infected infants are also more likely to respond to infection by developing antibody to the native antigen. Immunization of 12 adults with multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide induced significantly better antibody response to the core antigen than to the native, and this vaccine induced opsonic activity in only one recipient. Immunization of adults with type III group B streptococcal antigens induced antibody to the native determinant which correlated with opsonic activity. Therefore, it would appear that native group B streptococcal polysaccharides will provide the best candidate antigens for immunization.
TI  - Immunoprecipitation and opsonic cross-reaction between type-14 pneumococcus and group-B streptococcus type III.
AB  - Antisera directed against type-14 pneumococcus was opsonic for several strains of type-III group-B streptococcus. Furthermore, the polysaccharide antigen in the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine reacted to form precipitation lines with antisera directed against type-14 pneumococcus and group-B streptococcus type III Immunisation with currently available pneumococcal vaccine may provide opsonic antibody against group-B streptococci and provide a method of preventing neonatal group-B streptococcal infections.
TI  - ELISA methodology for polysaccharide antigens: protein coupling of polysaccharides for adsorption to plastic tubes.
AB  - A method is described which permits the adaption of ELISA techniques for measurement of antibody against bacterial polysaccharides. First, the polysaccharides antigen is covalently bound to poly-L-lysine, using cyanuric chloride as the coupling agent. The poly-L-lysine then adsorbs to the walls of plastic tubes, thus immobilizing the polysaccharide coupled to the poly-L-lysine. The method is simple, rapid, and utilizes small amounts of polysaccharide antigen.
TI  - Upper respiratory tract spread of group B streptococci type I b in a kindergarten.
AB  - In a kindergarten with 42 children and 17 female staff members, an epidemic of group B streptococcal carriage in the upper respiratory tract occurred. In the middle of February 1978, 6 children and 5 adults carried type I b streptococci in the throat while only 2 of these 11 were carriers 2 weeks later. Only one other streptococcus, belonging to type II, was found in the throat specimens. Five strains other than type I b were found in the urogenital tract of the staff. Three type I b throat carriers were also urogenital carriers of this type. The spread of type I b streptococci could have resulted from co-spreading with other upper respiratory tract pathogens found, including group A streptococci of type 12. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and pneumococci. Estimation of antibodies with radiolabelled protein A indicated an immune response to type I b, but not to types I a, II or III group B streptococci in the staff compared with healthy blood donors.
TI  - Comparison of staphylococcal coagglutination, latex agglutination, and counterimmunoelectrophoresis for bacterial antigen detection.
AB  - Soluble antigens of Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and group B streptococcus were looked for in cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and urine by using the staphylococcal coagglutination test, latex agglutination test, and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The staphylococcal coaggultination and latex agglutination tests were more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis in identifying antigens of H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae, and N. meningitidis. None of the three tests successfully detected group B streptococcal antigens in body fluids. Nonspecific reactions noted with the staphylococcal coagglutination test could be usually eliminated after premixing test specimens with soluble protein A.
TI  - An etiologic shift in infantile osteomyelitis: the emergence of the group B streptococcus.
AB  - Twenty-one infants from six to 52 days of age (mean 23.3 days) with osteomyelitis were studied between 1965 and 1977. The etiologic agents were group B streptococcus (8), staphylococcus aureus (6), gramnegative bacilli (4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), and unknown (2). Patients with group B streptococcal osteomyelitis were characterized by an uncomplicated neonatal course, single bone involvement with a predilection for involvement of the proximal humerus, and lack of inflammatory signs. In contrast, patients with osteomyelitis due to other organisms frequently had had manipulative procedures predisposing to infection and were more likely to have multiple bone involvement, fever, and leukocytosis at the time of diagnosis. Functional impairment was detected in only one of 17 patients evaluated a mean of 36 months after diagnosis.
TI  - Group B streptococcal and pneumococcal sepsis in newborn infants: the role of pneumococcal antibody.
AB  
TI  - Demonstration of opsonic activity and in vivo protection against group B streptococci type III by Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 antisera.
AB  - The present studies demonstrate that antisera directed against Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 is opsonic for group B streptococci type III in a neutrophile-mediated bactericidal assay. Specificity was demonstrated by the observations that group B streptococci type III and S. pneumoniae type 14 adsorbed the opsonic activity of anti-S. pneumoniae type 14 antisera. Group B streptococci strain 090R (devoid of type antigens) and S. pneumoniae type 3, did not remove the opsonic activity of anti-S. pneumoniae type 14 serum. In vivo studies using a suckling rat model of neonatal group B streptococcal type III sepsis demonstrated that antisera directed against S. pneumoniae type 14 was highly protective.
TI  - Evaluation of the counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure in a clinical laboratory setting.
AB  - The counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure was evaluated under clinical laboratory conditions to determine its validity and comparability with culture methods. The procedure was further evaluated to determine applicability to a variety of clinical samples. An inexpensive set-up was developed to utilize the CIE procedure at bench level. Results indicated the procedure to be sensitive in detecting Haemophilus influenzae, type b, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), group B. The procedure was more sensitive for detection of H. influenzae, type b, than for meningococcus, group B. The authors have confirmed the usefulness of the CIE procedure in the detection of group B streptococci, pneumococci and teichoic acid antibody to Staphylococcus aureus. Detection of Escherichia coli K 1 antigen was also accomplished by CIE. In the authors' laboratory the CIE procedure was superior to culture methods when used for the detection of H. influenzae, type b, and meningococcus group B.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Intramammary infections in a dairy herd with a low incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - In a dairy herd with a low incidence of intrammary infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, clinical mastitis remained a serious problem despite good control of nonclinical mastitis through postmilking teat disinfection and antibiotic therapy of known infected quarters at the end of lactation. During the 2-year study, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0.88 cases/cow-year; 32.2% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 33.5% by gram-negative organisms. Among all new infections detected, 54.1% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 25.7% by gram-negative bacteria. Among new infections, 41.6% occurred during the nonlactating period or within a few days of calving. Incidence of clinical mastitis was highest in the 1st month of lactation. Among 84 gram-negative infections, 42.8% were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 20.2% by Escherichia coli, and 23.8% by Enterobacter spp. Among the many serotypes of K pneumoniae and E coli, none was predominant.
TI  - Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and culture bacteria from the lower respiratory.
AB  - Forty-five specimens were obtained by sequential translaryngeal aspiration and fiberoptic bronchoscopy from 31 clinically unifected patients with lung cancer in order to evaluate the reliability of routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy for culture of the lower respiratory tract. Bacteria were recovered brom 98 percent (44) of the specimens obtained via fiberoptic bronchoscopy and from 58 percent (26) of the specimens obtained by the preceding translaryngeal aspiration. The microorganisms grown from cultures of specimens obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy consisted of mixtures of both nonpathogenic and potenitally pathogenic bacteria. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were present in 87 percent (39) of the specimens from fiberoptic bronchoscopy and 31 percent (14) of specimens from translayngeal aspiration. The results of cultures from the two procedures agreed completely in only a single instance. Culture of washings or secretions obtained by routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not recommended because it provides inaccurate and clinically confusing information about the presence or types of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract prior to instrumentation.
TI  - Accentuation of Staphylococcal hemolysis (CAMP-like test) by pneumococci.
AB  - A CAMP-like phenomenon can be observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is supposed to be caused likewise as in group B streptococci by a haemolysis accentuating factor. However, the form of the accentuated haemolysis is different from that in group B streptococci and similar to that in listeria.
TI  - Relation of concentrations of bacteria and bacterial antigen in cerebrospinal fluid to prognosis in patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  
TI  - [Infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with Klebsiella mastitis].
AB  - The infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of Klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. The following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from milk samples 28 and 31 times, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, Staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, Enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and Escherichia coli twice. The authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. Double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected Klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); However, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. The final deduction concerning the exogenic character of Klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.
TI  - Rapid specific identification of group D streptococci by counterimmunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Clinical isolates of group D streptococci have been examined by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) to determine if this method might be of value in the rapid identification of the members of this group. Group D organisms identified by classical biochemical and serologic procedures were inoculated into Todd Hewitt broth and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 4 hours of incubation, free group D streptococcal antigen was detected in broth cultures from 70 of 70 group D enterococcal strains. Precipitin lines were readily visible immediately after electrophoresis in each case. In contrast, 10 nonenterococcal group D strains failed to produce detectable free group D antigen in the Todd Hewitt broth after 4, 24, or 48 hours incubation. Such antigen was detectable, however, after 48 hours incubation in Mueller Hinton broth containing 10 grams of glucose per liter. Representative strains of group A, C, G, and B streptococi, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pneumoniae grown in Todd-Hewitt broth for 4 hours gave no precipitin lines when reacted against adsorbed monospecific group D antiserum. Group D antigen was also detected in broth cultures of direct swabs and in 18-hour blood culture broths. CIE appears to be a rapid and sensitive procedure for identification of the enterococcal strains of group D streptococci from clinical isolates.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - Concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 4.5 X 10(3) to 3 X  10(8) colony-forming units/ml in 27 patients with bacterial meningitis before antibiotic therapy and from 4 X 10(1) to 1.4 X 10(6) CFU/ml in four patients after one to two days of antibiotic therapy. All patients with persistent positive cultures had pretreatment concentrations of 10(7) CFU/ml or greater. A significant association was observed between cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid dehydrogenase activity and concentrations of bacteria (p less than 0.01). Large inocula of Hemophilus influenzae type b (10(7)) increased the minimal inhibitory concentration for penicillin and ampicillin but not for chloramphenicol. The minimal inhibitory concentration of each of the three antibiotics increased when group B streptococci were assayed. These data indicate that persistence of a positive culture may be related to large initial concentrations of bacteria. The relative "resistance" in vitro of large inocula possibly contributes to this persistence. These observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that lactic acid dehydrogenase activity in cerebrospinal fluid is derived from bacteria.
TI  - [Resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  - The present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. Schematically it can outlined as follows. Streptococcus B-haemolyticus as well as Pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. Streptococcus viridans, Enterococcus and H. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. Due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci is now resistant to penicillin. In addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. The resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. The introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. However, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. On the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. Incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due to Gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. Emergence of Pseudomonas, Proteus, Serratia, Providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to antibiotics. Carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.
TI  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus in adults.
AB  - Meningitis caused by Streptococcus is uncommon in adults. Otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, or trauma has antedated most cases reported in the past. Data on 10 recent cases suggest changes in the current pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis in adults and emphasize the importance of accurate streptococcal speciation. Endocarditis was present in five cases; trauma played a role in two others. Brain abscess, corticosteroids, alcoholic cirrhosis, and peritonitis secondary to chronic peritoneal dialysis were etiologic factors in five patients. Otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis were conspicuously absent. Streptococcus agalctiae accounted for purulent meningitis in two postmenopausal women. Both strains of group B Streptococcus were bacitracin-sensitive and were thus mislabeled group A. Recognition of Streptococcus bovis spared two patients unnecessary aminoglycoside adminstration. Nine of the 10 patients survived, including a women with prosthetic mitral valve endocarditis and a man with a ruptured brain abscess. Differentiation of these streptococci from Streptococcus pneumoniae was seldon possible on the basis of the spinal fluid gram stain alone.
TI  - Immunoelectroosmophoresis (IEOP) for detection of bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - 365 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from 259 patients were tested by the immunoelectroosmophoretic (IEOP) method to detect bacterial antigens. 25 patients had bacterial meningitis. The bacterial agent was identified by IEOP in 16 of 21 cases with aetiological agents detectable with the antisera employed. No false positive reactions occurred. The test gave true negative results in 340 instances. The rapidity, simplicity, sensitivity, reliability and low cost are emphasized.
TI  - Selective broth medium for isolation of group B streptococci.
AB  - A selective medium containing Todd-Hewitt broth, sheep blood, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin sulfate was found to enhance significantly the isolation of group B streptococci from vaginal cultures. Preparation of the medium, which is stable for up to 4 weeks at 4 C, is simple and inexpensive. Use of such a medium should facilitate identification of vaginal colonization with group B streptococci.
TI  - Enhancement of the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of chloramphenicol  and thiamphenicol by normal serum in vitro.
