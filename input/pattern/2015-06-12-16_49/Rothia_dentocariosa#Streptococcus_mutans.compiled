TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - Detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a TaqMan-based real-time PCR.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using TaqMan PCR and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. Plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by TaqMan PCR. RESULTS: The quantity of the cariogenic bacteria Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacilllus spp., Rothia dentocariosa, Parvimonas micra, Propionibacterium acnes and Neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of Veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. No significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria except P. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. CONCLUSION: All the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.
TI  - Microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study group consisted of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. The study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. After a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus LB21 (107 CFU/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). Samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). The salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. The presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation technique. Differences between the groups were assessed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests. RESULTS: The mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. The most prevalent dominating species in the plaque samples were Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus gordonii. The saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with Streptococcus mitis, Rothia dentocariosa, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. All of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. No statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium L. rhamnosus LB21 did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.
TI  - MLPA diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  - A multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. However, multiplex PCR techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube PCR. Here we report a novel use of MLPA in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. We designed 9 species specific probes for: Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral Streptococci and Lactobacilli based on their 16S rDNA sequences. MLPA analysis of DNA pooled from the strains showed the expected specific MLPA products. Relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar DNA showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. Moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests MLPA can be a cheaper alternative to using qPCR for quantification. We observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of MLPA products in DNAs isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. Furthermore, MLPA analyses of DNA isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. This clearly shows the usefulness of MLPA in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  - Molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. Samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. Samples were cultured on blood agar and Rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% CO(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. DNA was also extracted directly from the samples and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR with universal primers. PCR products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. We identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. Only three taxa, Streptococcus mutans, Rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed Propionibacterium sp., were found in all five samples. The predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel Propionibacterium sp. (18%), Olsenella profusa (14%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). The predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were Streptococcus mutans (16%), Lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). There was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon matched pairs, signed ranks test). In conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous novel taxa are present.
