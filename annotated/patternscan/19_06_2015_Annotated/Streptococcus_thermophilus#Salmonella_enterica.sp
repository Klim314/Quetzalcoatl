TI  == identification and characterization of starter lactic acid bacteria and probiotics from columbian dairy products.
AB  == aims: considering the significant rise in the probiotic market in columbia, and given the lack of reports concerning the microbial population and strain performance in products from different producers, this study aims at determining  the number of viable starter bacteria and probiotics in bio-yoghurts available at the columbian market, identifying the species and analysing the performance of the isolated strains in bile acid resistance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, and adherence capacity to human intestinal epithelial cells. methods and results: seven bio-yoghurts were analysed for the bacterial species present.  species identification was carried out using 16s rrna gene targeted pcr. the cultured bacteria were tested for bile acid resistance, adherence to a human intestinal epithelial cell line, and antagonism against the pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. a total of 17 different strains were identified. based on plate counting, all bio-yoghurts have at least total viable cells of approximately 10(7) cfu ml(-1). streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were the most frequently isolated bacteria. viable bifidobacterium was only recovered from one product. however, after pcr analysis, dna of this genus was confirmed in five out of seven products. major differences  were found for s. typhimurium antagonism. the adherence capacity to caco-2 cells  was observed in 10 of the isolated strains. in general, low survival to simulated gastric juice was observed. conclusions: some of the isolated strains have probiotic potential, although not all of them were present in the advised amount  to exert beneficial health effects. however, the full correct scientific name of  the isolated bacteria and their viable counts were not included on the product label. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report describing  the identification and functionality of starter bacteria and probiotics present in dairy products on the columbian market.

TI  == acid adaptation affects the viability of salmonella typhimurium during the lactic fermentation of skim milk and product storage.
AB  == in this study, salmonella typhimurium was acid adapted at ph 5.5 for 4 h. the viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted cells of s. typhimurium was investigated both during the lactic fermentation of skim milk with streptococcus  thermophilus or lactobacillus bulgaricus, and during the storage of lactic fermented milk products at 5 degrees c. it was found that the viable population of s. typhimurium, regardless of acid adaptation, increased in skim milk during the initial 24 h of lactic fermentation and then declined. however, the viable population of acid-adapted s. typhimurium was significantly higher (p<.05) than that of non-adapted cell at the end of 48 h of fermentation. acid-adapted cells of s. typhimurium were also found to have survived better than non-adapted cells  in the s. thermophilus-prepared fermented milk and two commercial lactic fermented milk products. the viability of the acid-adapted and non-adapted s. typhimurium at 5 and 37 degrees c in cell-free fermented milks that had their phs adjusted to 6.4 and skim milk (ph 6.4) was further investigated. results revealed that acid adaptation, in addition to enhancing acid tolerance, reduced the susceptibility of s. typhimurium to refrigerated temperature and other detrimental factors which might be present in lactic fermented milk products. these responses all contribute to the enhanced survival of acid-adapted s. typhimurium in the lactic fermented milk products observed in the present study.

TI  == mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab), an indirect-acting mutagen, on salmonella typhimurium ta 100, was then investigated. it was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on sal. typhimurium ta 100. fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. the levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo. among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both str. themophilus and b. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-nqo and dmab further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against dmab, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-nqo.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81.
AB  == a new bacteriocin, produced by streptococcus thermophilus 81 has been isolated, purified and characterized. by its heat sensitivity and broad inhibitory spectrum it does not resemble any other s. thermophilus bacteriocin. the mode of action is bacteriostatic. this peptide of 32 amino acids is efficient against several bacillus species, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica. this bacteriocin is heat labile but its activity was not altered by ph variation from 3 to 10. six months of storage at 40 degrees c did not influence the activity. the inactivation by detergents and the inability to resolve the protein in sds-page supposes a more complex structure or a possible stabilizing effect of other molecules. the low sensitivity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus to  the isolated bacteriocin suggests that s. thermophilus 81 may be used in yoghurt  starters.

TI  == antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  == yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. we recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (dmab) (mutation res. (1995) 334, 213-224). we are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against mnng.

TI  == regulation of glycerol and maltose uptake by the iiaglc-like domain of iinag of the phosphotransferase system in salmonella typhimurium lt2.
AB  == in enterobacteriaceae the nonphosphorylated form of iiaglc of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (pts) can inhibit the uptake and subsequent metabolism of glycerol and maltose by binding to, and inhibiting, glycerol kinase and the malk protein of the maltose transport system, respectively. in this report we show that the iiaglc-like domain of the membrane-bound iin-acetylglucosamine (iinag) of the pts can replace iiaglc in a salmonella typhimurium crr mutant strain that lacks all soluble iiaglc. the inhibition was most severe in cells which were partially induced for the glycerol or maltose uptake systems. the streptococcus thermophilus lactose transporter lacs, which also contains a iiaglc-like domain, could not replace iiaglc. neither iinag nor lacs could replace iiaglc in activation of adenylate cyclase.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacterial culture liquid on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strains].
AB  == it was shown that cell extracts and cells of streptococcus faecalis decrease the  mutagenic effect of 2-nitrofluorene in salmonella typhimurium strain ta1538 by 73 and 48%, respectively. cell extracts and cells of bifidobacterium bifidum and propionibacterium shermanii exhibited weak antimutagenic activity. no antimutagenic effect was found in escherichia coli ab1157, lactobacillus delbrueckii, or streptococcus thermophilus. antimutageneicity of the cell extract of str. faecalis is both associated with extracellular factors interacting with 2-nitrofluorene (desmutagenesis) and with factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagen biotransformation and mutation induction. thiol compounds produced by growing str. faecalis may be desmutagenic factors. a relatively heat-stable substance or substances of a peptide nature with a mm less than 12 kda are antimutagenic factors affecting intracellular processes of mutagenesis.

TI  == antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt.
AB  == reconstituted non-fat dry milk powder, fermented by a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus ch3 and lactobacillus bulgaricus 191r to produce yogurt, was freeze-dried and extracted in acetone. after evaporation of the acetone, the extract was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) and tested for antimutagenicity. in the ames test, significant dose-dependent activity was observed against n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng), 4-nitro-quinoline-n-oxide (4nqo), 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (dmab), 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz[a]anthracene (dmba), and 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (trp-p-2). weak activity was observed against 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (deo), and no activity was observed against methyl methanesulfonate (mms), ethyl methanesulfonate (ems), or aflatoxin b1 (afb1). in a related assay (saccharomyces cerevisiae d7), significant antimutagenic activity was detected against mnng and 4nqo. activity against the experimental colon carcinogens mnng and dmab was examined further, as assayed in  the ames test (salmonella typhimurium ta100). compounds responsible for both activities were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dmso. adjustment of yogurt ph to 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not  significantly alter the amount of anti-mnng activity recovered. in contrast, extractability of anti-dmab activity was significantly greater at acidic ph. conjugated linoleic acid, a known dairy anticarcinogen, failed to inhibit mutagenesis caused by either mutagen, suggesting that other yogurt-derived compound(s) are responsible. unfermented milk was treated with lactic acid, yogurt bacteria without subsequent growth, or both, to determine if formation of  antimutagenic activity required bacterial growth. extracts of the milk treatments exhibited the same weak antimutagenicity observed in unfermented milk, approximately 2.5-fold less than in the yogurt extracts, suggesting that antimutagenic activity is associated with bacterial growth.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
AB  == it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum,  and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the  bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.

TI  == antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the s. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  == a high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. one way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of dna damage and other types of anticarcinogens. specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. we have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. four  types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. the effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. eight of 10 isolated lactobacillus strains reduced the yield  of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. the degree of  suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. in contrast,  yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. the other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. the results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the melb gene encoding the melibiose permease of salmonella typhimurium lt2.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the melb gene coding for the na+ (li+)/melibiose symporter of salmonella typhimurium lt2 was determined, and its amino acid sequence was deduced. it consists of 1428 bp, corresponding to a protein of 476 amino acid residues (calculated molecular weight 52,800). the amino acid sequence is homologous to that of the melibiose permease of escherichia coli k12, with 85% identical residues. all, except one, of the amino acid residues that have been reported to be important for cation or substrate recognition in the melibiose permease of e. coli are conserved in the melibiose permease of s. typhimurium. in addition, part of the sequence resembles the lactose permease of streptococcus thermophilus, the animal glucose transporter (glut1), the plasmid-coded raffinose permease (rafb), and the nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4 (nuo4) of aspergillus amstelodami.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == adherence of specific yogurt micro-organisms to human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  == yogurt lactic-acid-bacteria (lab) consisting of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl). these micro-organisms adhere to human t lymphocytes, and bind to b lymphocytes, in high and low frequencies, respectively. in addition, a quantitative analysis of lab binding to pbl was carried out using the same parameters previously applied to a salmonella model. the effect of yogurt lab on the natural anti-bacterial activity exerted by pbl was examined. lymphocyte pretreatment with bacteria did not affect such functions. these findings are discussed in the light of the well known ability of yogurt lab to modulate the immune response.

TI  == enhancement of host resistance against salmonella typhimurium infection by a diet supplemented with yogurt.
AB  == the effect of a diet supplemented with yogurt containing live lactobacilli (lab)  - lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus - on the response of inbred mice to infection with salmonella typhimurium was elaborated. the results  of our experiments were consistent with the hypothesis that modifications of the  microflora influence the adherence of s. typhimurium to intestinal mucosa, the natural antibacterial activity of the peyer's patches lymphocytes, the accumulation of the macrophages in the liver, the proliferative responses of the  splenocytes. the relationship between modifications of the immune response following ingestion of yogurt with live lab and increased defense mechanisms was  confirmed by the bacterial counts in livers and spleens and by the reduced mortality to s. typhimurium infection.

TI  == antimutagenic properties of lactic acid-cultured milk on chemical and fecal mutagens.
AB  == the antimutagenic properties of milk cultured with lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were examined using streptomycin-dependent strains of  salmonella in an in vitro assay system. the mutagens utilized for testing included 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide, 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide, and fecal mutagenic extracts from cats, monkeys, dogs, and other mammals. both types of cultured milk exhibited antimutagenic activity on all mutagens used. antimutagenic activities of the cultured milks with 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl) acrylamide and 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide increased with incubation time but were thermolabile beyond 55 degrees c for 10 min.
