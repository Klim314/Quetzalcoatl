TI  == isolation and genomic characterization of the t4-like bacteriophage pm2 infecting pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum.
AB  == in order to control pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, a novel virulent bacteriophage pm2 was isolated. bacteriophage pm2 can infect 48% of p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and 78% of p. carotovorum subsp. brasilliensis but none of atrosepticum, betavasculorum, odoriferum and wasabiae isolates had been infected with pm2. pm2 phage belongs to the family myoviridae, and contains a large head and contractile tail. it has a 170,286 base pair genome that encodes 291 open reading frames (orfs) and 12 trnas. most orfs in bacteriophage pm2 share a high level of homology with t4-like phages including ime08, rb69, and js98. phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of terminase large subunits confirmed that pm2 is classified as a t4-like phage. it contains no integrase- or no repressor-coding genes related to the lysogenic cycle, and lifestyle prediction using phact software suggested that pm2 is a virulent bacteriophage.

TI  == simultaneous detection of major blackleg and soft rot bacterial pathogens in potato by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for simultaneous, fast and reliable detection of the main soft rot and blackleg potato pathogens in europe has been developed. it utilises three pairs of primers and enables detection of three groups of pectinolytic bacteria frequently found in potato, namely: pectobacterium atrosepticum, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum together with pectobacterium wasabiae and dickeya spp. in a multiplex pcr assay.  in studies with axenic cultures of bacteria, the multiplex assay was specific as  it gave positive results only with strains of the target species and negative results with 18 non-target species of bacteria that can possibly coexist with pectinolytic bacteria in a potato ecosystem. the developed assay could detect as  little as 0.01 ng microl-1 of dickeya sp. genomic dna, and down to 0.1 ng microl-1 of p. atrosepticum and p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum genomic dna in  vitro. in the presence of competitor genomic dna, isolated from pseudomonas fluorescens cells, the sensitivity of the multiplex pcr decreased tenfold for p.  atrosepticum and dickeya sp., while no change was observed for p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and p. wasabiae. in spiked potato haulm and tuber samples, the threshold level for target bacteria was 101 cfu ml-1 plant extract (102 cfu g-1 plant tissue), 102 cfu ml-1 plant extract (103 cfu g-1 plant tissue), 103 cfu ml-1 plant extract (104 cfu g-1 plant tissue), for dickeya spp., p. atrosepticum  and p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum/p. wasabiae, respectively. most of all, this assay allowed reliable detection and identification of soft rot and blackleg pathogens in naturally infected symptomatic and asymptomatic potato stem and progeny tuber samples collected from potato fields all over poland.

TI  == genomic overview of the phytopathogen pectobacterium wasabiae strain rns 08.42.1a suggests horizontal acquisition of quorum-sensing genes.
AB  == the blackleg and soft-rot diseases caused by pectinolytic enterobacteria such as  pectobacterium and dickeya are major causes of losses affecting potato crop in the field and upon storage. in this work, we report the isolation, characterization and genome analysis of the pectobacterium wasabiae (formerly identified as pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum) strain rns 08.42.1a, that has been isolated from a solanum tuberosum host plant in france. comparative genomics with 3 other p. wasabiae strains isolated from potato plants in different areas in north america and europe, highlighted both a strong similarity at the whole genome level (ani > 99 %) and a conserved synteny of the virulence genes. in addition, our analyses evidenced a robust separation between these four p. wasabiae strains and the type strain p. wasabiae cfbp 3304(t), isolated from horseradish in japan. in p. wasabiae rns 08.42.1a, the expi and expr nucleotidic  sequences are more related to those of some pectobacterium atrosepticum and p. carotovorum strains (90 % of identity) than to those of the other potato p. wasabiae strains (70 to 74 % of identity). this could suggest a recruitment of these genes in the p. wasabiae strain rns 08.42.1a by an horizontal transfer between pathogens infecting the same potato host plant.

TI  == role and regulation of the flp/tad pilus in the virulence of pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043 and pectobacterium wasabiae scc3193.
AB  == in this study, we characterized a putative flp/tad pilus-encoding gene cluster, and we examined its regulation at the transcriptional level and its role in the virulence of potato pathogenic enterobacteria of the genus pectobacterium. the flp/tad pilus-encoding gene clusters in pectobacterium atrosepticum, pectobacterium wasabiae and pectobacterium aroidearum were compared to previously characterized flp/tad gene clusters, including that of the well-studied flp/tad pilus model organism aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, in which this pilus is a major virulence determinant. comparative analyses revealed substantial protein sequence similarity and open reading frame synteny between the previously characterized flp/tad gene clusters and the cluster in pectobacterium, suggesting that the predicted flp/tad gene cluster in pectobacterium encodes a flp/tad pilus-like structure. we detected genes for a novel two-component system adjacent to the flp/tad gene cluster in pectobacterium, and mutant analysis demonstrated that this system has a positive effect on the transcription of selected flp/tad pilus biogenesis genes, suggesting that this response regulator regulate the flp/tad gene cluster. mutagenesis of either the predicted regulator gene or selected flp/tad pilus biogenesis genes had a significant impact on the maceration ability of the bacterial strains in potato tubers, indicating that the flp/tad pilus-encoding gene cluster represents a novel virulence determinant in pectobacterium. soft-rot enterobacteria in the genera pectobacterium and dickeya  are of great agricultural importance, and an investigation of the virulence of these pathogens could facilitate improvements in agricultural practices, thus benefiting farmers, the potato industry and consumers.

TI  == an easy, simple inexpensive test for the specific detection of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum based on sequence analysis of the pmra gene.
AB  == background: the species pectobacterium carotovorum includes a diverse subspecies  of bacteria that cause disease on a wide variety of plants. in morocco, approximately 95% of the p. carotovorum isolates from potato plants with tuber soft rot are p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. however, identification of this pathogen is not always related to visual disease symptoms. this is especially true when different pathogen cause similar diseases on potato, citing as an example, p. carotovorum, p. atrosepticum and p. wasabiae. numerous conventional methods were used to characterize pectobacterium spp., including biochemical assays, specific pcr-based tests, and construction of phylogenetic trees by using gene sequences. in this study, an alternative method is presented using a gene linked to pathogenicity, in order to allow accuracy at subspecies level. the pmra gene (response regulator) has been used for identification and analysis of the relationships among twenty nine pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and other pectobacterium subspecies. results: phylogenetic analyses of pmra sequences compared to eric-pcr and 16s rdna sequencing, demonstrated that there is considerable genetic diversity in p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum strains, which can be divided into two distinct groups within the same clade. conclusions: pmra sequence analysis is likely to be a reliable tool to identify the subspecies pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and estimate their genetic diversity.

TI  == taxonomic relatedness between pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. odoriferum and pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense subsp. nov.
AB  == aims: pectobacterium carotovorum is a heterogeneous species consisting of two named subspecies, p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and p. carotovorum subsp. odoriferum. a third subspecies, p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense, was previously proposed. the study aimed to confirm the subspecies status and validate the proposed name of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense using a novel and standard microbial taxonomy. methods and results: dna-dna hybridization confirmed that p.  carotovorum subsp. brasiliense is a different species from p. wasabiae, p. betavasculorum and p. atrosepticum, with 28, 35 and 55% similarity values, respectively, but is a member of the p. carotovorum species with 73-77% similarity values. sequencing the entire 16s rrna gene of two polymorphic copies  from strains of each of the p. carotovorum subspecies demonstrated that the average 16s rrna gene sequence diversity between p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense and p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum was lower than the maximum genetic distances between two sequence types obtained from the same strain. multilocus sequence analysis based on eight housekeeping genes (mtld, acna, icda, mdh, pgi, gaba, proa and rpos) differentiated the subspecies and delineated two p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense clades. conclusion: pectobacterium carotovorum  subsp. brasiliense clade i was comprised of strains isolated from brazil and peru, while clade ii included strains from asia, north america and europe. strains in clade i but not clade ii were phenotypically consistent with the original description of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense in that they produced reducing substances from sucrose and acid from alpha-methyl glucoside. the type strain for p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense 212(t) (= lmg2137(t) = ibsbf1692(t)  = cfbp6617(t) ) was previously designated. the gc mol content of the type strain  is 51.7%. significant and impact of the study: the study introduces a full description for the strains belonging to the two different clades assigned to p.  carotovorum subsp. brasiliense.

TI  == pectobacterium spp. associated with bacterial stem rot syndrome of potato in canada.
AB  == pectobacterium atrosepticum, p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis, p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, and p. wasabiae were detected in potato stems with blackleg symptoms using species- and subspecies-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  the tests included a new assay for p. wasabiae based on the phytase gene sequence. identification of isolates from diseased stems by biochemical or physiological characterization, pcr, and multi-locus sequence typing (mlst) largely confirmed the pcr detection of pectobacterium spp. in stem samples. p. atrosepticum was most commonly present but was the sole pectobacterium sp. detected in only 52% of the diseased stems. p. wasabiae was most frequently present in combination with p. atrosepticum and was the sole pectobacterium sp. detected in 13% of diseased stems. pathogenicity of p. wasabiae on potato and its capacity to cause blackleg disease were demonstrated by stem inoculation and its  isolation as the sole pectobacterium sp. from field-grown diseased plants produced from inoculated seed tubers. incidence of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis was low in diseased stems, and the ability of canadian strains to cause blackleg in plants grown from inoculated tubers was not confirmed. canadian isolates of p. carotovorum subsp. brasiliensis differed from brazilian isolates in diagnostic biochemical tests but conformed to the subspecies in pcr specificity and typing by mlst.

TI  == elevation of three subspecies of pectobacterium carotovorum to species level: pectobacterium atrosepticum sp. nov., pectobacterium betavasculorum sp. nov. and  pectobacterium wasabiae sp. nov.
AB  == a collection of 42 strains belonging to the five subspecies of pectobacterium carotovorum (subspecies atrosepticum, betavasculorum, carotovorum, odoriferum and wasabiae) and 11 reference and type strains of biovars of pectobacterium chrysanthemi, pectobacterium cacticidum and brenneria paradisiaca were studied by dna-dna hybridization, numerical taxonomy of 120 phenotypic characteristics, serology and new phylogenetic analysis of previously reported sequences from a database of aligned 16s rdna sequences. the p. carotovorum subspecies formed a clade according to neighbour-joining methods, but they formed two paraphyletic clusters according to maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony. however, phylogenetic analysis of 16s rdna sequences alone is not sufficient to justify generic differentiation and therefore, it is proposed to retain the p. carotovorum subspecies in the genus pectobacterium. the strains of p. carotovorum were distributed in four genomospecies: genomospecies 1, harbouring all strains of subsp. atrosepticum, genomospecies 2, including the strains of subsp. betavasculorum isolated from sugar beet, sunflower, potato, hyacinth and artichoke, genomospecies 3, clustering all strains of subsp. wasabiae isolated from wasabi in japan, and genomospecies 4, gathering together strains of subsp. carotovorum and strains of subsp. odoriferum. four strains of p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum remained unclustered. biochemical criteria, deduced from a numerical taxonomy study of phenotypic characteristics and serological reactions, allowed discrimination of strains belonging to the four genomospecies. thus, it is proposed that three genomospecies be elevated to species level as pectobacterium atrosepticum sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 1526t =lmg 2386t =ncppb 549t =icmp 1526t), pectobacterium betavasculorum sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 2122t =lmg 2464t =ncppb 2795t =icmp 4226t) and pectobacterium wasabiae sp. nov. (type strain cfbp 3304t =lmg 8404t =ncppb 3701t =icmp 9121t). only two subspecies are maintained within p. carotovorum, subsp. carotovorum (type strain cfbp 2046t =lmg 2404t =ncppb 312t =icmp 5702t) and subsp. odoriferum (type strain cfbp 1878t =lmg 5863t =ncppb 3839t = icmp 11553t), for which discriminating tests are available.

TI  == phylogenetic position of phytopathogens within the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the almost complete 16s rdna sequences of twenty nine plant-associated strains, representing species of the genera erwinia, pantoea and enterobacter were determined and compared with those of other members of the enterobacteriaceae. the species of the genus erwinia may be divided into three phylogenetic groups. cluster i represents the true erwinias and comprises e. amylovora, e. mallotivora, e. persicinus, e. psidii, e. rhapontici and e. tracheiphila. we propose to unite the species of cluster ii, e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e.  carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. carotovora  subsp. odorifera, e. carotovora subsp. wasabiae, e. cacticida, e. chrysanthemi and e. cypripedii in the genus pectobacterium respectively as p. carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum comb. nov.,  p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. odoriferum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. wasabiae comb. nov., p. cacticidum comb. nov.,  p. chrysanthemi and p. cypripedii. the species e. alni, e. nigrifluens, e. paradisiaca, e. quercina, e. rubrifaciens and e. salicis, comprising cluster iii, are being classified into a new genus brenneria gen. nov. respectively as b. alni comb. nov., b. nigrifluens comb. nov., b. paradisiaca comb. nov., b. quercina comb. nov., b. rubrifaciens comb. nov. and b. salicis comb. nov. the species of the genus pantoea, included in this study, form a monophyletic unit (cluster iv), closely related with erwinia, whereas the three phytopathogenic species of the genus enterobacter are scattered among the genera citrobacter and klebsiella.
