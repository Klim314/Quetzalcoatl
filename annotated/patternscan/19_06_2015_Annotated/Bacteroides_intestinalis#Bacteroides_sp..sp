TI  == bacteroides luti sp. nov., an anaerobic, cellulolytic and xylanolytic bacterium isolated from methanogenic sludge.
AB  == a mesophilic, anaerobic, cellulolytic and xylanolytic strain, uasxn-3t, was isolated from anaerobic granular sludge in a mesophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor, which was used to treat municipal sewage. the cells were gram-stain-negative, non-motile, and non-spore-forming rods. the optimal temperature for growth was 37-40 degrees c and the optimal ph for growth was ph 6.5-7.0. strain uasxn-3t could grow on several polysaccharides and sugars, including cellulose, cellobiose, xylan, xylose, glucose, fructose, arabinose, mannose, raffinose, trehalose and starch. the dna g+c content was 44.4 mol%. on the basis of comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, strain uasxn-3t was identified as a member of the genus bacteroides and most closely related to bacteroides oleiciplenus, b. intestinalis, b. cellulosilyticus and b. graminisolvens (sequence similarities of 91.3-91.6%). since the genetic and phenotypic properties suggest that strain uasxn-3t represents a novel species, we propose the name bacteroides luti sp. nov. the type strain is uasxn-3t (=jcm 19020t=dsm 26991t).

TI  == the antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low molar mass chitosans  (lmwc) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (cs) hydrolysates. here, we show the in vitro effect of different cos, lmwc, and  cs on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary cs products by humans. specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (clostridium paraputrificum, clostridium beijerinckii, roseburia intestinalis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% cos (2, 3, and 6 kda), 0.025 and  0.05% of lmwc (10 and 16 kda), and 0.025 and 0.1% of cs in vitro. the growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of cos and lmwc in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. a relatively higher resistance to cs hydrolyzates was detected in r. intestinalis and f. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to bacteoides sp. and clostridium sp. the antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. the antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (dp). mic ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and dp of cs/lmwc. mbc also decreased with dp. the most effective antimicrobial action was detected in lmwc with 16 kda and cs. weak antimicrobial activity was found in cos with small molecules (2 and 3 kda).

TI  == bacteroides clarus sp. nov., bacteroides fluxus sp. nov. and bacteroides oleiciplenus sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == three gram-stain-negative, obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria (strains yit 12056t, yit 12057t and yit 12058t) were isolated from human faeces. these strains were characterized by phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequence and phenotypic tests. 16s rrna gene sequence analyses revealed that strains yit 12056t, yit 12057t and yit 12058t were most closely related to the type strains of bacteroides gallinarum, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides intestinalis with approximate similarity values of 96.6, 95.0 and 96.7%, respectively. the dna g+c contents of the novel strains were 45.3 (yit 12056t), 45.2 (yit 12057t) and 43.6 mol% (yit 12058t) and the major respiratory quinones of all three isolates were menaquinones mk-10 and mk-11. these properties were typical for members of the genus bacteroides. the results of the other phenotypic analyses also supported the affiliation of these strains to the genus bacteroides. the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, analysis of the major cellular  fatty acids and other biochemical tests enabled the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the three new strains. based on these data, three novel species, bacteroides clarus sp. nov., bacteroides fluxus sp. nov. and bacteroides oleiciplenus sp. nov. are proposed. the type strains of b. clarus, b. fluxus and  b. oleiciplenus are yit 12056t (=jcm 16067t=dsm 22519t), yit 12057t (=jcm 16101t=dsm 22534t) and yit 12058t (=jcm 16102t=dsm 22535t), respectively.

TI  == bacteroides cellulosilyticus sp. nov., a cellulolytic bacterium from the human gut microbial community.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium, strain cre21(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. cells were gram-negative non-motile rods that were about 1.7 microm in length and 0.9 microm in width. strain cre21(t) degraded different types of cellulose and was able to grow on a variety of carbohydrates. cellulose  and sugars were mainly converted to acetate, propionate and succinate. the g+c content of the dna was 41.1 mol%. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate belonged to the genus bacteroides with highest sequence similarity to the type strain of bacteroides intestinalis (98 %). dna-dna hybridization results revealed that strain cre21(t) was distinct from b. intestinalis (40 % dna-dna relatedness). strain cre21(t) also showed several characteristics distinct from b. intestinalis. in particular, it exhibited different capacity to degrade polysaccharides such as cellulose. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and the  morphological, physiological and biochemical data presented in this study, strain cre21(t) can be readily differentiated from recognized species of the genus bacteroides. the name bacteroides cellulosilyticus sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate this organism. the type strain is cre21(t) (=dsm 14838(t)=ccug 44979(t)).

TI  == characterization of the xylan-degrading microbial community from human faeces.
AB  == in humans, plant cell wall polysaccharides represent an important source of dietary fibres that are digested by gut microorganisms. despite the extensive degradation of xylan in the colon, the population structure and the taxonomy of the predominant bacteria involved in degradation of this polysaccharide have not  been extensively explored. the objective of our study was to characterize the xylanolytic microbial community from human faeces, using xylan from different botanic origins. the xylanolytic population was enumerated at high level in all faecal samples studied. the predominant xylanolytic organisms further isolated (20 strains) were assigned to roseburia and bacteroides species. some bacteroides isolates corresponded to the two newly described species bacteroides intestinalis and bacteroides dorei. other isolates were closely related to bacteroides sp. nov., a cellulolytic bacterium recently isolated from human faeces. the remaining bacteroides strains could be considered to belong to a new species of this genus. roseburia isolates could be assigned to the species roseburia intestinalis. the xylanase activity of the bacteroides and roseburia isolates was found to be higher than that of other gut xylanolytic species previously identified. our results provide new insights to the diversity and activity of the human gut xylanolytic community. four new xylan-degrading bacteroides species were identified and the xylanolytic capacity of r. intestinalis was further shown.

TI  == bacteroides intestinalis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == during studies of the microbiota of human faeces, five strains of gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated following growth in a polyamine-deficient medium. these strains belonged to the genus bacteroides on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence data. 16s rrna gene sequence similarity between one of the strains, 341t, and recognized species within the genus bacteroides was <95 %. the dna g+c  content (44 mol%) and major fatty acid composition (anteiso-c(15 : 0), 32.0 %) supported the affiliation of strain 341(t) to the genus bacteroides. biochemical  tests and dna-dna hybridization analysis demonstrated that strain 341t was distinct from bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides helcogenes, to which it was related most closely. on the basis of these data, a novel bacteroides species, bacteroides intestinalis sp. nov., is proposed with strain 341t (= jcm 13265t = dsm 17393t) as the type strain.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
