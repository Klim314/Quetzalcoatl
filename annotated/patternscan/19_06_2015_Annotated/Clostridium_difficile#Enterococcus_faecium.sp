TI  == mutations associated with reduced surotomycin susceptibility in clostridium difficile and enterococcus species.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is an urgent public health concern causing  considerable clinical and economic burdens. cdi can be treated with antibiotics,  but recurrence of the disease following successful treatment of the initial episode often occurs. surotomycin is a rapidly bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that is in clinical trials for cdi treatment and that has demonstrated superiority over vancomycin in preventing cdi relapse. surotomycin is a structural analogue of the membrane-active antibiotic daptomycin. previously, we  utilized in vitro serial passage experiments to derive c. difficile strains with  reduced surotomycin susceptibilities. the parent strains used included atcc 700057 and clinical isolates from the restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) groups bi and k. serial passage experiments were also performed with vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. the goal of this study is to identify mutations associated with reduced surotomycin susceptibility in c. difficile and enterococci. illumina sequence data generated for the parent strains and serial passage isolates were compared. we identified nonsynonymous mutations in genes coding for cardiolipin synthase in c. difficile atcc 700057, enoyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase ii (fabk) and cell division protein ftsh2 in c. difficile rea type bi, and a padr family transcriptional regulator in c. difficile rea type k. among the 4 enterococcal strain pairs, 20 mutations were identified, and those mutations overlap those associated with daptomycin resistance. these data give insight into the mechanism of action of surotomycin against c. difficile, possible mechanisms  for resistance emergence during clinical use, and the potential impacts of surotomycin therapy on intestinal enterococci.

TI  == a modified r-type bacteriocin specifically targeting clostridium difficile prevents colonization of mice without affecting gut microbiota diversity.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide and has become an urgent public health threat requiring immediate attention. epidemic lineages of the bi/nap1/027 strain type have emerged and spread through health care systems across the globe over the past decade. limiting person-to-person transmission and eradicating c. difficile, especially the bi/nap1/027 strain type, from health care facilities are difficult due to the abundant shedding of spores that are impervious to most interventions. effective prophylaxis for c. difficile infection (cdi) is lacking. we have genetically modified a contractile  r-type bacteriocin ("diffocin") from c. difficile strain cd4 to kill bi/nap1/027-type strains for this purpose. the natural receptor binding protein (rbp) responsible for diffocin targeting was replaced with a newly discovered rbp identified within a prophage of a bi/nap1/027-type target strain by genome mining. the resulting modified diffocins (a.k.a. avidocin-cds), av-cd291.1 and av-cd291.2, were stable and killed all 16 tested bi/nap1/027-type strains. av-cd291.2 administered in drinking water survived passage through the mouse gastrointestinal (gi) tract, did not detectably alter the mouse gut microbiota or disrupt natural colonization resistance to c. difficile or the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), and prevented antibiotic-induced colonization of mice inoculated with bi/nap1/027-type spores.  given the high incidence and virulence of the pathogen, preventing colonization by bi/nap1/027-type strains and limiting their transmission could significantly reduce the occurrence of the most severe cdis. this modified diffocin represents  a prototype of an avidocin-cd platform capable of producing targetable, precision anti-c. difficile agents that can prevent and potentially treat cdis without disrupting protective indigenous microbiota. importance: treatment and prevention strategies for bacterial diseases rely heavily on traditional antibiotics, which  impose strong selection for resistance and disrupt protective microbiota. one consequence has been an upsurge of opportunistic pathogens, such as clostridium difficile, that exploit antibiotic-induced disruptions in gut microbiota to proliferate and cause life-threatening diseases. we have developed alternative agents that utilize contractile bactericidal protein complexes (r-type bacteriocins) to kill specific c. difficile pathogens. efficacy in a preclinical  animal study indicates these molecules warrant further development as potential prophylactic agents to prevent c. difficile infections in humans. since these agents do not detectably alter the indigenous gut microbiota or colonization resistance in mice, we believe they will be safe to administer as a prophylactic  to block transmission in high-risk environments without rendering patients susceptible to enteric infection after cessation of treatment.

TI  == serine/threonine protein phosphatase-mediated control of the peptidoglycan cross-linking l,d-transpeptidase pathway in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == the last step of peptidoglycan polymerization involves two families of unrelated  transpeptidases that are the essential targets of beta-lactam antibiotics. d,d-transpeptidases of the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) family are active-site serine enzymes that use pentapeptide precursors and are the main or exclusive cross-linking enzymes in nearly all bacteria. however, peptidoglycan cross-linking is performed mainly by active-site cysteine l,d-transpeptidases that use tetrapeptides in mycobacterium tuberculosis, clostridium difficile, and  beta-lactam-resistant mutants of enterococcus faecium. we have investigated reprogramming of the e. faecium peptidoglycan assembly pathway by a switch from pentapeptide to tetrapeptide precursors and bypass of pbps by l,d-transpeptidase  ldtfm. mutational alterations of two signal transduction systems were necessary and sufficient for activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway, which is essentially cryptic in wild-type strains. the first one is a classical two-component regulatory system, ddcrs, that controls the activity of ldtfm at the substrate level. as previously described, loss of ddcs phosphatase activity leads to production of the d,d-carboxypeptidase ddcy and conversion of the pentapeptide into the tetrapeptide substrate of ldtfm. here we show that full bypass of pbps by ldtfm also requires increased ser/thr protein phosphorylation resulting from impaired activity of phosphoprotein phosphatase stpa. this enzyme  negatively controlled the level of protein phosphorylation both by direct dephosphorylation of target proteins and by dephosphorylation of its cognate kinase stk. in combination with production of ddcy, increased protein phosphorylation by this eukaryotic-enzyme-like ser/thr protein kinase was sufficient for activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway in the absence of mutational alteration of peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes. importance: the mechanism of acquisition of high-level ampicillin resistance involving bypass of  the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) by l,d-transpeptidase ldtfm was incompletely understood, as production of tetrapeptide precursors following transcriptional activation of the ddc locus by the ddcrs two-component regulatory system was necessary but not sufficient for full activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway. here, we identified the release of a negative control of ser/thr protein phosphorylation mediated by phosphatase stpa as the additional factor essential for ampicillin resistance. thus, bypass of pbps by ldtfm requires the modification of signal transduction regulatory systems without any gain of function by mutational alteration of peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes. in contrast, previously characterized mechanisms of antibiotic resistance involve horizontal gene transfer and mutational alteration of drug targets. activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway reported in this study is an unprecedented mechanism of emergence of a new metabolic pathway since it involved the recruitment of preexisting functions following modifications of regulatory circuits.

TI  == surotomycin demonstrates low in vitro frequency of resistance and rapid bactericidal activity in clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == surotomycin (cb-183,315) is an orally administered, minimally absorbed, selective bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide in phase 3 development for the treatment of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. the aim of this study was to evaluate  the emergence of resistance in c. difficile (atcc 700057 and three recent clinical isolates from the restriction endonuclease analysis groups bi, bk, and k), vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis (atcc 49452), vancomycin-resistant (vr) e. faecalis (atcc 700802), vs enterococcus faecium (atcc 6569), and vr e. faecium (atcc 51559) under anaerobic conditions. the rate  of spontaneous resistance was below the limit of detection (<10(-8) to <10(-9)) for surotomycin at 16 and 32x the mic for all isolates tested. under selective pressure by serial passage, c. difficile grew in a maximum of 4 mug/ml surotomycin (final mics of 2 to 8 mug/ml [4- to 16-fold higher than those of the  naive control]) at day 15, with the exception of the c. difficile bk strain, which grew in 16 to 32 mug/ml (final mics of 8 to 32 mug/ml [16- to 64-fold higher than those of the naive control]). enterococci remained relatively unchanged over 15 days, growing in a maximum of 8 mug/ml surotomycin (final mics  of 2 to 16 mug/ml [8- to 64-fold higher than those of the naive control]). of the isolates tested, no cross-resistance to vancomycin, rifampin, ampicillin, metronidazole, or moxifloxacin was observed. surotomycin at 20x mic demonstrated  equally rapid bactericidal activity (>/= 3-log-unit reduction in cfu/ml in </= 8  h) against naive and reduced-susceptibility isolates of c. difficile, vs enterococcus (vse), and vr enterococcus (vre), except for c. difficile bk (2.6-log-unit reductions for both). these results suggest that emergence of resistance to surotomycin against c. difficile, e. faecalis, and e. faecium is likely to be rare.

TI  == the prevention and management of infections due to multidrug resistant organisms  in haematology patients.
AB  == infections due to resistant and multidrug resistant (mdr) organisms in haematology patients and haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are an increasingly complex problem of global concern. we outline the burden of illness  and epidemiology of resistant organisms such as gram-negative pathogens, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), and clostridium difficile in haematology cohorts. intervention strategies aimed at reducing the impact of these organisms are reviewed: infection prevention programmes, screening and fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. the role of newer therapies (e.g. linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline) for treatment of resistant and mdr organisms in haematology populations is evaluated, in addition to the mobilization of older agents (e.g. colistin, pristinamycin and fosfomycin) and the potential benefit of combination regimens.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == microbiota-mediated colonization resistance against intestinal pathogens.
AB  == commensal bacteria inhabit mucosal and epidermal surfaces in mice and humans, and have effects on metabolic and immune pathways in their hosts. recent studies indicate that the commensal microbiota can be manipulated to prevent and even to  cure infections that are caused by pathogenic bacteria, particularly pathogens that are broadly resistant to antibiotics, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, gram-negative enterobacteriaceae and clostridium difficile. in this review, we discuss how immune- mediated colonization resistance against antibiotic-resistant intestinal pathogens is influenced by the composition of the commensal microbiota. we also review recent advances characterizing the ability of different commensal bacterial families, genera and species to restore colonization resistance to intestinal pathogens in antibiotic-treated hosts.

TI  == one-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 german hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == the complex dynamics of antimicrobial activity in the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract is a complex environment of mutualistic associations. as bacteria form a major component of fecal content, the natural balance of the colon can be significantly altered by exposure to antimicrobial agents. however, the effects of antimicrobial therapy on fecal content are difficult to predict and can at times be quite surprising. the emergence and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci are cases in point. resistance to the  glycopeptide vancomycin emerged in enterococci (primarily in enterococcus faecium) in the late 1980s in both europe and the united states. in europe, this  emergence was tied to the use of the glycopeptide antibiotic avoparcin to promote growth in food animals and had little actual impact on hospital infections. in the united states, where avoparcin has never been licensed, vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (vre) emerged as a major hospital pathogen. paradoxically, while the  initial entry of the vancomycin resistance determinants into enterococci was almost certainly driven by high fecal concentrations of vancomycin associated with treatment for clostridium difficile colitis, clinical infection and outbreaks were more frequently tied to use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins and agents with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria. animal studies suggest that cephalosporins promote initial vre colonization because of the frequent concomitant high-level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics expressed by these strains. anti-anaerobic agents appear to increase the output of vre in the feces, presumably by reducing the number of competitive flora in the colon. intravenously administered vancomycin appears to have little impact because it achieves negligible concentrations in the feces after short courses. thus, the spread of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is promoted in a large measure by the administration of non-glycopeptide antibiotics.

TI  == a probiotics-containing biscuit modulates the intestinal microbiota in the elderly.
AB  == objectives: evaluation of the impact of a biscuit containing the probiotics bifidobacterium longum bar33 and lactobacillus helveticus bar13 on the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. design: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. participants: thirty-two elderly volunteers living in italy. the group was composed of 19 women and 13 men aged between 71 and 88 years (mean 76). intervention: subjects were randomized in two groups consuming one dose of the probiotics-containing biscuit or placebo once a day for 30 days. measurements: for each subject the intestinal microbiota was characterized using the phylogenetic microarray platform htf-microbi.array before and after intervention. results: our data demonstrated that one-month consumption of a probiotics-containing biscuit was effective in redressing some of the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota. in particular, the probiotic treatment reverted the age-related increase of the opportunistic pathogens clostridium cluster xi, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecium  and the enteropathogenic genus campylobacter. conclusion: the present study opens the way to the development of elderly-tailored probiotic-based functional foods to counteract the age-related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == [dynamics of contamination and persistence of clostridium difficile in intestinal microbiota in newborn infants during antibiotic therapy and use of probiotic strain enterococcus faecium l3].
AB  == ninety four infants were observed as inpatients. thirty nine of them were mature  neonates and 55 were premature infants with a very low body weight. the majority  of the patients were treated with antibiotics. the mature infants were treated with penicillins, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and the premature neonates were treated in addition with carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides. the mature infants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (n=18) received the standard therapy and the main group (n=21) in addition received 1 ml of liquid probiotic enterococcus faecium l3 (with a titer of 5x10(8) cfu/ml) 2 times a day  for 10 days. the premature newborn infants were also randomized into 2 groups. the control group (n=26) received the standard therapy. the main group (n=29) additionally received 1 ml of liquid probiotic e.faecium l3 2 times a day for 10  days. the effectiveness of the therapy in the mature neonates was evaluated by the frequency of dyspeptic disorders and in the premature infants by the frequency of infectious complications and the episodes of food intolerance. the intestinal microbiota of the infants was investigated by the real-time pcr and bacteriological analyses of the feces: in the mature infants on admission to the  hospital and 10 days after the treatment (periods 1-2), in the premature infants  on admission to the hospital and then twice with an interval of 14 days (periods  1-2-3). it was shown that the use of the probiotic strain e.faecium l3 during the antibiotic therapy in the premature infants promoted significant reduction in the frequency of infectious complications. in the mature neonates the probiotic therapy reduced the risk of dyspeptic disorder. the studies showed reduction in persistence of clostridium difficile in the intestinal microbiota of the newborn  infants receiving the antibiotic therapy in combination with probiotic e.faecium  l3, that was accompanied by preserving and growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and reduction of the number of opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == changing epidemiology of clostridium difficile-associated disease during stem cell transplantation.
AB  == the incidence and severity of clostridium difficile-associated disease (cdad) within the general population has risen dramatically over the past decade, yet little data are available from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) centers. in the present study, we performed a chart review of 822 consecutive autologous and allogeneic hcst recipients treated at northwestern memorial hospital between 2004 and 2008 to determine the incidence of cdad at our institution. variables including age, sex, diagnosis, chemotherapy regimen, transplantation type, microbial colonization, coinfections, diet, antibiotic use, neutropenic fever, comorbid conditions, time to engraftment, growth factor administration, and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease were assessed as potential risk factors for the development of cdad. eighty-five cdad cases (10.3%) were identified. bivariate analysis revealed a significant association between cdad and neutropenic fever, administration of a neutropenic diet, ciprofloxacin and aztreonam use and duration of therapy, vancomycin and aztreonam use and duration of therapy, receipt of an allogeneic transplantation, bacterial  coinfection, and vancomycin-resistant entereococcus faecium (vre) colonization. cox regression analysis identified the following as factors associated with the development of cdad: age >60 years, allogeneic transplantation, and prior vre colonization. allogeneic recipients with cdad experienced increased higher rates  of grades ii to iv gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease and nonrelapse mortality. a risk stratification model was developed to identify hsct recipients  at different levels of risk. with an incidence >10%, cdad is a significant infectious complication of stem cell transplantation.

AB  == background: the antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (moo3)  has been recently described. the metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (h3o+), which creates an acidic ph that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. we determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. methods: metalloacid-coated and non-coated  (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/ml. eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate mrsa mu50 strain and a st80-pvl-producing mrsa strain); a vancomycin-resistant vana enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains; a mbl-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  baumannii strain; a toxin-producing clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus). the assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. results: against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. conclusions: we suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

AB  == to explore the structure-activity relationships (sar) of demethylvancomycin (2) and find more effective new chemical entities than known glycopeptides for the treatment of clostridium difficile (c. difficile), 17 novel n-substituted (n-arylmethylene or -aliphatic substituents) demethylvancomycin derivatives were  prepared. these analogues have been evaluated in vitro for their antibacterial activities against c. difficile and enterococcus faecium (e. faecium). compounds  5d, 5h, and 5i with n-arylmethylene substituents, structurally similar to oritavancin, showed more potent antibacterial activity against c. difficile than  vancomycin (1) or demethylvancomycin (2). meanwhile, compound 5k with an undecyl  side chain showed the most potent antibacterial activity against e. faecium (vancomycin-resistant strain).

TI  == changes in human fecal microbiota due to chemotherapy analyzed by taqman-pcr, 454 sequencing and pcr-dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == background: we investigated whether chemotherapy with the presence or absence of  antibiotics against different kinds of cancer changed the gastrointestinal microbiota. methodology/principal findings: feces of 17 ambulant patients receiving chemotherapy with or without concomitant antibiotics were analyzed before and after the chemotherapy cycle at four time points in comparison to 17 gender-, age- and lifestyle-matched healthy controls. we targeted 16s rrna genes  of all bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacteria, clostridium cluster iv and xiva as  well as c. difficile with taqman qpcr, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing. after a significant drop in the abundance of microbiota (p = 0.037) following a single treatment the microbiota recovered within a few days. the chemotherapeutical treatment marginally affected the bacteroides while the clostridium cluster iv and xiva were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment. dgge  fingerprinting showed decreased diversity of clostridium cluster iv and xiva in response to chemotherapy with cluster iv diversity being particularly affected by antibiotics. the occurrence of c. difficile in three out of seventeen subjects was accompanied by a decrease in the genera bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, veillonella and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. enterococcus faecium increased following chemotherapy. conclusions/significance: despite high individual variations, these results suggest that the observed changes in the human gut microbiota may favor colonization with c. difficile and enterococcus faecium. perturbed microbiota may be a target for specific mitigation with safe pre- and probiotics.

TI  == a call to arms: the imperative for antimicrobial stewardship.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major public health crisis. the prevalence of drug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging nap1 strain of clostridium difficile, now highly resistant to fluoroquinolones, acinetobacter species, klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, is increasing nationwide. the sources of antimicrobial resistance are manifold, but there is a well-documented  causal relationship between antimicrobial use and misuse and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. as the development of new antimicrobial agents is on the decline, the medical community, across all specialties and in conjunction with public health services, must develop and implement programs and  strategies designed to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing antimicrobial armamentarium. such strategies are collectively known as antimicrobial stewardship programs and have the potential to minimize the emergence of resistant pathogens.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated  from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated  at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 micrcog/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, vcm, teicoplanin, linezolid(lzd) and qpr/dpr had mic90s of < or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of e. faecalis strains or 3.5% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to lzd. 24.4% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr. against  all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm were under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity against c. difficile. carbapenems showed good activity against peptococcaceae, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. however since several strains of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the  future.

TI  == [recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide cect7121 against human gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == spectrum of activity and mode of action of rep3123, a new antibiotic to treat clostridium difficile infections.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == development and application of the active surveillance of pathogens microarray to monitor bacterial gene flux.
AB  == background: human and animal health is constantly under threat by emerging pathogens that have recently acquired genetic determinants that enhance their survival, transmissibility and virulence. we describe the construction and development of an active surveillance of pathogens (asp) oligonucleotide microarray, designed to 'actively survey' the genome of a given bacterial pathogen for virulence-associated genes. results: the microarray consists of 4958 reporters from 151 bacterial species and include genes for the identification of  individual bacterial species as well as mobile genetic elements (transposons, plasmid and phage), virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes. the asp microarray was validated with nineteen bacterial pathogens species, including francisella tularensis, clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the asp microarray identified these bacteria, and provided information on potential antibiotic resistance (eg sufamethoxazole resistance and sulfonamide resistance) and virulence determinants including genes likely to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer (e.g. an alpha-haemolysin). conclusion: the asp microarray has potential in the clinic as a diagnostic tool, as a research tool for both known and emerging pathogens, and as an early warning system for pathogenic bacteria that have been recently modified either naturally or deliberately.

AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre)  bowel colonization in hospitalized patients in manitoba who had stool specimens collected for clostridium difficile toxin and/or culture testing. design: two tertiary care and five community hospitals in winnipeg and three rural manitoba community hospitals participated in this study. from january 1 to december 31, 1997 stool specimens, one per patient, submitted to hospital microbiology laboratories for c difficile toxin and/or culture testing were screened for vre on colistin-nalidixic acid-vancomycin (6 microg/ml) (cnav) agar plates. the study was divided into six, eight-week intervals. stool specimens received in the first two weeks of each eight week interval were screened for vre. main results: a total of 1408 stool specimens were submitted over the 48-week study period. sixty-seven (4.8%) patients with vre colonization of their lower gastrointestinal tract were identified. three of the 67 (4.5%) vre isolates were enterococcus faecium, with the remaining 64 (95.5%) were enterococcus gallinarum. the three vancomycin-resistant e faecium -vref- (from two different winnipeg hospitals) demonstrated the vana genotype, and were resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and ampicillin. all three vref isolates also demonstrated high level resistance to both gentamicin and streptomycin but were susceptible to quinuprisitin/dalfopristin and ly333328. conclusion: vre colonization in hospitalized patients in manitoba is infrequent and most commonly due to e gallinarum. the prevalence of vref colonization in the patients studied was 0.2%  (three of 1408).

TI  == screening for vancomycin-resistant enterococci using stools sent for clostridium  difficile cytotoxin assay is effective: results of a survey of 300 patients in a  large singapore teaching hospital.
AB  == introduction: to assess the efficacy of screening stools sent for clostridium difficile cytotoxin assay (cdta) for surveillance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). materials and methods: from april to may 2005, all stools submitted for cdta were also cultured for vre using vancomycin containing culture media. isolates were identified to species level and vancomycin resistance confirmed, followed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for detection of vancomycin resistance genes and dna fingerprinting. over 2 consecutive days during that period, stool specimens or rectal swabs were also obtained from all patients in high-risk units (haematology, oncology, renal and intensive care). fifty-one patients in each group were compared in terms of vre risk factors previously identified. results and discussion: the prevalence of vre in both groups was similar [3/204 (1.5%) in the cdta arm and 1/97 (1.0%) in the high-risk arm; p = 1.0, fisher's exact test]. prevalence of risk factors for vre colonisation, including age, duration of hospitalisation, exposure to antibiotics, exposure to surgical procedures, presence of malignancy and diabetes mellitus was similar in both groups (p > 0.05). only renal failure (p < 0.05) was more common in the high-risk group. all 4 isolates of vre identified were genetically distinct by variable number tandem repeat (vntr) typing; 3 were enterococcus faecium (2 with the vanb gene, 1 with vana) and one e. faecalis. conclusion: less than 2% of our high-risk patients are vre carriers. in-hospital  vre screening using stools sent for cdta is a simple, reasonable surrogate for screening individual high-risk patients as the patient risk profile is similar and the yield comparable in a low-prevalence setting.

TI  == identification of tn5397-like and tn916-like transposons and diversity of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) in enterococci from humans, pigs and poultry.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the sequence diversity of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) and its location on mobile elements in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis from humans, pigs and poultry in denmark. methods: a total  of 76 isolates were screened for tn916/tn1545-like and tn5397-like transposons using pcr. tet(m) was sequenced in 15 of the isolates and compared with tet(m) sequences submitted to genbank (phylogenetic analysis and signs of recombination). plasmids were extracted, filter-mating experiments were performed and tn5397-like transposons were further characterized in selected isolates. results: in 8 of 13 isolates of e. faecium from broilers, tet(m) was present on tn5397-like transposons, whereas tet(m) was predominantly associated with tn916/tn1545-like transposons in e. faecium from pigs and humans, as well as in e. faecalis from humans, pigs and broilers (50 of 63 isolates). the tet(m) genes  were divided into three major subgroups according to the phylogenetic analysis. subgroup i consisted of tet(m) from clostridium difficile and e. faecium associated with tn5397-like elements, subgroup ii consisted of tet(m) located on  tn916/tn1545 family transposons and subgroup iii consisted of tet(m) associated with composite elements containing several resistance genes. we found evidence of recombination both within and between these groups. moreover, we identified an e. faecium isolate with both tn916/tn1545-like and tn5397-like elements. conclusions: this study showed that enterococci contain diverse tet(m) genes present on different mobile elements, which may suggest that enterococci play an  important role in the evolution and horizontal spread of mobile elements carrying tet(m). this is the first report of tn5397-like elements in enterococci.

TI  == 2004 lowbury lecture: the western australian experience with vancomycin-resistant enterococci - from disaster to ongoing control.
AB  == the first hospital outbreak of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) in western australia (wa) started in the royal perth hospital in july 2001 and initially involved the intensive care unit (icu) and the nephrology and dialysis  units. the outbreak was caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) of the vanb genotype. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analysis of the isolates demonstrated a single-strain outbreak. despite the isolation of carriers and implementation of all the additional precautions recommended to control vre, vref spread rapidly. two months after the index patient was detected, the epidemic strain had spread to 22 wards and units and one outpatient unit (satellite dialysis). four patients were infected and 64 were colonized. a hospital vre executive group, which included the chief executive and directors of clinical services and nursing, was formed to eradicate the outbreak  and to prevent the epidemic strain from becoming endemic in the hospital. the wa  department of health agreed to provide substantial extra funding to enable the hospital to use expensive enhanced infection control practices, as follows. control was handicapped by the slowness of conventional laboratory methods, which took four to five days to identify vre and allowed environmental contamination and nosocomial transmission to occur before carriers were detected and isolated.  a laboratory procedure to make rapid provisional identification of vre within 30-48h was developed by performing multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for  vana and vanb genes directly on 24-h selective enrichment broth cultures. on average, four rectal swabs, each collected on separate days, were needed to detect >90% of carriers. in total, 1977 ward contacts were screened after discharge from hospital and 54 (2.73%) were found to be carrying vref. the electronic labelling and active follow-up of ward contacts resulted in a significant number of carriers being detected who otherwise posed a risk of initiating further outbreaks in hospital if they were re-admitted. the outbreak was terminated after five months and the cost of the enhanced infection control practices was 2,700 000 australian dollars (1,000,000 pounds sterlings). ongoing  control has been facilitated by targeted active surveillance cultures: on admission to high-risk units (icu, burns, nephrology, haematology, bone marrow transplant unit), on transfer out of the icu to other hospital units, by monthly  screening of patients regularly attending dialysis units, and by opportunistic laboratory screening of inpatient faecal specimens submitted for clostridium difficile culture and toxin. vigilance needs to be maintained as the epidemic strain of vref remains in the perth community. ward contacts of the first outbreak have caused small outbreaks in two hospitals, and seven to 19 sporadic new carriers have been detected annually since the first outbreak. the key elements of the vre control programme are as follows: to date, this programme has prevented vre from becoming established in any wa hospital.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens and effect on treatment.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens is a growing concern for health care and for public health. a recent shift in the epidemiological profile of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has resulted not only in health care-associated infections but now, also, in community-associated infections. reports have described s. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility  and, even, resistance to vancomycin. the rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci may be leveling; however, vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium has already achieved high levels. multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasing, and carbapenem-resistant klebsiella strains are emerging. acinetobacter species cause a minority of health care-associated pneumonias due to gram-negative organisms, but a growing proportion is resistant  to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. recent increases in the frequency and severity of clostridium difficile-associated illness are associated with the emergence of a hypervirulent c. difficile strain with increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones. the presence of these and other resistant organisms in health care facilities limits the number of effective antimicrobials available for treatment.

TI  == bacillus clausii probiotic strains: antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities.
AB  == the clinical benefits observed with probiotic use are mainly attributed to the antimicrobial substances produced by probiotic strains and to their immunomodulatory effects. currently, the best-documented probiotic bacteria used  in human therapy are lactic acid bacteria. in contrast, studies aiming to characterize the mechanisms responsible for the probiotic beneficial effects of bacillus are rare. the current work seeks to contribute to such characterization  by evaluating the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of probiotic b. clausii strains. b. clausii strains release antimicrobial substances in the medium. moreover, the release of these antimicrobial substances was observed during stationary growth phase and coincided with sporulation. these substances were active against gram-positive bacteria, in particular against staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecium, and clostridium difficile. the antimicrobial activity was resistant to subtilisin, proteinase k, and chymotrypsin treatment, whereas it was sensitive to pronase treatment. the evaluation of the immunomodulatory properties of probiotic b. clausii strains was performed in vitro on swiss and c57 bl/6j murine cells. the authors demonstrate that these strains, in their vegetative forms, are able to induce nos ii synthetase activity, ifn-gamma production, and cd4 t-cell proliferation.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == protection from gastrointestinal diseases with the use of probiotics.
AB  == probiotics are nonpathogenic microorganisms that, when ingested, exert a positive influence on the health or physiology of the host. they can influence intestinal  physiology either directly or indirectly through modulation of the endogenous ecosystem or immune system. the results that have been shown with a sufficient level of proof to enable probiotics to be used as treatments for gastrointestinal disturbances are 1) the good tolerance of yogurt compared with milk in subjects with primary or secondary lactose maldigestion, 2) the use of saccharomyces boulardii and enterococcus faecium sf 68 to prevent or shorten the duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 3) the use of s. boulardii to prevent further recurrence of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and 4) the use of fermented milks containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg to shorten the duration of  diarrhea in infants with rotavirus enteritis (and probably also in gastroenteritis of other causes). effects that are otherwise suggested for diverse probiotics include alleviation of diarrhea of miscellaneous causes; prophylaxis of gastrointestinal infections, which includes traveler's diarrhea; and immunomodulation. trials of gastrointestinal diseases that involve the ecosystem are currently being performed, eg, helicobacter pylori infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium in a long-term care facility.
AB  == objective: to describe the epidemiology and natural history of colonization with  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) in a long-term care facility. design: all patients in whom vref was isolated were followed prospectively, with  rectal swab cultures at 2-week intervals, until discharge, death, or clearance of vref. clearance was defined as two consecutive negative cultures. in addition, three prevalence surveys were conducted of all patients in residence on one 34-bed intermediate care ward. setting: a 400-bed, long-term care veterans affairs facility. participants: thirty-six patients colonized with vref. results: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium was identified in 24 of the 36 patients at the time of transfer from an acute care facility. seventeen patients had concomitant methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and seven patients had a recent history of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. vref in these patients persisted for a median of 67 days after identification. treatment of vref colonization with antimicrobials was associated with prolongation of colonization. serial surveillance of the 34-bed ward found stable rates of colonization, with only three documented instances of vref acquisition. during 2.5 years of surveillance for infection, a single case of bacteremia occurred in  a patient in whom colonization with vref could not be demonstrated by rectal swab culture. no infections occurred in patients colonized with vref. conclusions: long-term care patients have protracted carriage of vref. most will improve over  time; however, receipt of antimicrobial therapy is associated with prolongation of vref carriage. the risk of vref infection is low in this population. when there are appropriate contact precautions, patient to patient transmission occurs at a low rate. these observations can be used to design a practical infection control strategy for long-term care facilities.

TI  == surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aim: to describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of enterococcus species in auckland. background: antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. it is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. methods: enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group i were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group ii were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group iii were enterococci from stool specimens sent for clostridium difficile toxin testing; group iv were isolates from stool specimens  submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. all enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. results: there were 121 group i enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group ii specimens; 166/279 (60%) group iii specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group  iv specimens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were e faecalis, 12% e faecium, 6% e gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. no isolate produced beta-lactamase. all e faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. two e faecium and one enterococcus species were  resistant to amoxycillin (mics all 16 mg/l). all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. fourteen e gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate  susceptibility to vancomycin (mics of 8 mg/l). one e faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8 mg/l). high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. conclusion: vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., e casseliflavus and e gallinarum. our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. this allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.

TI  == pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.

TI  == manipulation of a hospital antimicrobial formulary to control an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == infection control practices are not uniformly successful in limiting outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). despite the implementation of barrier precautions for vre-infected patients, nearly one-half of the inpatients at our center were found to have gastrointestinal colonization by vre. in an attempt to  control the outbreak, we altered the antibiotic formulary by restricting the use  of cefotaxime and vancomycin and adding beta-lactamase inhibitors to replace third-generation cephalosporins. the use of clindamycin was also restricted because of a concomitant outbreak of clostridium difficile colitis. after 6 months, the average monthly use of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, vancomycin, and clindamycin had decreased by 84%, 55%, 34%, and 80%, respectively (p < .02). the  point prevalence of fecal colonization with vre decreased from 47% to 15% (p < .001), and the number of patients whose clinical specimens were culture positive  also gradually decreased. a change in antibiotic use appears to have significantly affected our vre outbreak when previous measures failed.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been recovered with increasing  frequency from hospitalized patients. risk factors, mode of nosocomial transmission, extent of colonization in hospitalized patients, and treatment options for these organisms have not been completely delineated. methods: we studied 53 patients (group a) with vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from various clinical specimens and also surveyed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in stool specimens submitted for clostridium difficile toxin assays (group b). stool specimens submitted for identification of bacterial pathogens and stool specimens from hospital employees were also analyzed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. results: seventy-six isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were recovered in group a. five of these patients harbored vancomycin-resistant enterococci on admission. fifty-three of 289 group b stool specimens submitted for c. difficile toxin assays yielded vancomycin-resistant enterococci. cephalosporins and vancomycin were the most common antimicrobial agents received  by both groups of patients. enterococcus faecium isolates were more resistant than enterococcus faecalis isolates to antimicrobial agents. all isolates exhibited high-level aminoglycoside resistance and were not beta-lactamase producers. there were at least 15 different molecular clones of e. faecium and three of e. faecalis. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a 100% in-hospital mortality rate. conclusions: multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens that  are difficult to treat. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a poor prognosis. we found a high rate of colonization in patients with suspected c. difficile toxin colitis. judicious use of vancomycin and broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended, and strict infection control measures must be implemented to prevent nosocomial transmission of these organisms.

AB  == we investigated in 15 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or endometrium, who were undergoing postoperative radiation therapy, the effects of  different fractionated radiation exposures on counts of fecal bacteria, on the growth of clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens enterotoxin production. we observed a generally significant decrease in intestinal microflora after the first radiation exposure, whereas at the end of radiotherapy all bacteria increased and reached basal values except enterococcus faecium 1, lactobacilli and total anaerobes. in some patients we observed an overgrowth of some clostridium spp. which were potential pathogens associated with clinical symptoms. we did not observe an influence of multiple radiations on c. perfringens enterotoxin fecal contents. we conclude that patients receiving radiotherapy may benefit from the intake of oral bacteriotherapy, i.e. live beneficial bacteria such as bacillus subtilis at the beginning of the irradiation exposure.

TI  == [the influence of cefpirome on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == cefpirome (cpr, hr810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its effect on the intestinal bacterial flora in pediatric patients. the subjects were children admitted for infections (6 males and 3 females, 1 month to 5 years 1 month old, weighted 3.94 to 21.0 kg). cpr was intravenously administered at a dose between 19.0 to 40.0 mg/kg, 3 to 4 doses daily over 6 to 12 days. the feces from these children were collected before, during, and after administration, and bacteria were identified and counted. cpr concentration, beta-lactamase activity, and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. bacterial flora changes in feces during cpr administration showed some variance,  but generally 5 cases out of the 9 showed a significant decrease in enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis among aerobic bacteria. the other 4  cases showed some transient decrease, but no significant change was observed. no  significant changes were recognized for enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecium, and the total aerobic bacterial count decreased in a transient manner in only one patient. regarding anaerobic bacteria, bifidobacterium and eubactrium revealed a significant decrease, a transient decrease or no change from case to case. bacteroides showed little change in count. consequently, the total anaerobic bacteria count did not reveal a large change aside from 1 case in which bacteroides was not detected before administration and a significant decrease of  other bacteria was noted. in no case, glucose nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungi were found dominant. although c. difficile and c. difficile d-1  antigen were detected in 3 and 4 cases, respectively, there was no exact relationship between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. cpr was detected in fecal samples from 6 cases during administration with  concentrations ranging between 1.20 to 22.4 micrograms/g. high values of cpr tended to be found in specimens with low beta-lactamase activity in the feces. when drug sensitivities of the bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration were compared, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococci and bacteroides during or after administration than  before administration. the above results suggest that cpr is a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora in children, but a particular attention is required for diarrhea and microbial replacement during a  continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.
