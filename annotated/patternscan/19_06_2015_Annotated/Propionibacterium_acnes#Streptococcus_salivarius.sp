TI  == comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora in postoperative maxillary cyst fluid by 16s rrna gene and culture methods.
AB  == intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc), and dna was extracted from the pomc fluid. bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16s rrna gene. identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. the phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16s rrna gene clones. a total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. a total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in pomc fluid samples by 16s rrna gene analysis. species of prevotella (91%), neisseria (73%), fusobacterium (73%), porphyromonas (73%), and propionibacterium (73%) were found  to be highly prevalent in all patients. streptococcus mitis (64%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (55%), propionibacterium acnes (55%), staphylococcus capitis (55%), and streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. the results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by  16s rrna gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect  by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with  pomc.

TI  == inhibition of propionibacterium acnes by bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) produced by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == we report the in vitro inhibition of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) by a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis-like substance) produced by streptococcus salivarius (s. salivarius). bacteriocins are proteinaceous substances produced by bacteria that are capable of inhibiting the growth of similar bacterial strains. unlike classical antibiotics, they have a relatively narrow spectrum of killing activity, resulting in a reduction in the intensity of selection for resistance. these findings suggest that blis may potentially be used for its anti-p. acnes activity in the treatment of acne.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

TI  == prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius t140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == [interferon production and natural killer activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis].
AB  == interferon (ifn) -system of patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) during the stable stage of the disease activity was investigated. thirty six patients were divided into 3 groups of mild, moderate and severe patients according to the scores of disability status scale (dss). ifn-alpha producibility and natural killer (nk) activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) or large granular lymphocytes (lgl) fractionated from pbl were determined by culturing with hela cells persistently infected with measles virus (hela/mv) and k562 cells. ifn-gamma was induced in pbl obtained from the patients using killed cells of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), listeria monocytogenes (lm) and streptococcus salivarius (str. sal.) and a lectin of concanavalin a (con a). both ifn-alpha producibility and nk activity of pbl obtained from the patients were depressed in parallel with the severity of dss of the patients. the depressed nk activity of the patients could be recovered by neither ifn-alpha nor interleukin-2 added exogenously. in addition, the induction of ifn-gamma was also depressed in the patients in response to p. acnes and lm, but not str. sal. or con a. these results suggest that the defect of ifn-system observed in pbl of the patients may result from the depressed function of both lgl and t lymphocyte subpopulations which are responsive to p. acnes and lm. it is postulated that these immunocompetent cells might migrate to subclinical demyelinating lesions of central nervous system where cytokines including ifn-gamma were produced locally, and that their migration might result in the quantitative decrease of lymphocytes participating in ifn-system in pbl of patients with ms.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
